J.S wonders what will happen [if Jacob Zuma is found
guilty](http://www.blogsouthafrica.net/2007/12/29/hamba-scorpions-kissing-
protest-and-zuma-charged/): “I keep wondering what this is going to mean for
us especially in terms of his election victory in the ANC. What will the
outcome be if he gets found guilty? Some people have speculated that the
‘groundroots’ supporters will revolt and we could be headed for a type of
civil war – the pro-Mbeki vs the pro-Zuma camps.”
