Heatwaves during this time of year is not uncommon for countries in South
Asia. But the recent dry weather has kept sufficient rain away from the region
keeping the mercury rising. And l[oad
shedding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadshedding) (rolling electricity
blackouts) due to power crisis in several countries have made the lives of
millions of people unbearable.

Last Friday (April 24, 2009) was the [hottest day of this
summer](http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=82325&cid=21&aoth=1) (with 38.5
Celsius) for Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The Eastern parts of India is
choking as [mercury rises above 45 degree
Celsius](http://www.asianage.com/presentation/leftnavigation/news/india/north,-east-
india-reels-as-mercury-above-45%C2%BAc.aspx). Several deaths have been
reported. Zoo officials in Patna took [special
measures](http://hamaraphotos.com/news/national/patna-zoo-animals-sheltered-
from-heat-wave.html) to protect the animals from heat. There have been reports
of [forest fire in
Nepal](http://www.nepalnews.com/archive/2009/mar/mar25/news02.php), and
[droughts in the typical rain prone
areas](http://nepaldendro.blogspot.com/2009/03/freak-weather-travails-for-
chirapunji.html).

The netizens are reacting strongly to this situation. _Sukanya M_ writes in
the post “[United We Sweat](http://saintfaron.blogspot.com/2009/04/united-we-
sweat.html)” about the heat and the constant power cuts:

> Phew. It's been unbearable.

> Temperatures ranging around 40, 41, 41.8, and if we are lucky (like today),
> 39 degrees. Plus Humidity – according to Yahoo it is 84% today (felt like
> 100%). And of course power cuts everywhere and in a bizarre turn of affairs,
> Kolkata – Dumdum to Behala had 6-10 hours of power cut on Sunday..[..]

Here are some Twitter messages catching up the mood of common people:

> [calamur:](http://twitter.com/calamur) Melting in the heat . #mumbai is
> seriously hot .

> [vitrag:](http://twitter.com/vitrag) afternoon heat, and boarding the Mumbai

In Bangladesh people are suffering badly because of [heat wave and frequent
rolling blackouts](http://carbon-based-ghg.blogspot.com/2008/04/heat-wave-
makes-public-life-miserable.html). Most people do not have air-condition at
home; they use electric fans, which are useless during power cuts. Those who
can afford to use [power
inverters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_inverter) do not get enough
electricity to recharge the units. Worse, there is not enough electricity to
run the water pumps. The water crisis has grown acute and people are
[protesting against the water shortage](http://www.independent-
bangladesh.com/200804244714/country/hundreds-protest-over-water-shortage-in-
dhaka.html).

From Twitter:

> [dkhall44:](http://twitter.com/dkhall44) Load shedding now at ridiculous
> levels in Dhaka. Electricity supply is cut for one hour every other hour.
> And its *38* degrees.

> [shahreaz:](http://twitter.com/shahreaz) Working from the evening sounds
> more realistic in Dhaka. 6 hours of load shedding during the working hours
> do not make sense.

The power authorities have put up [schedules of power
outages](http://www.desco.org.bd/load_shedding.php) online. _Bernie Allen_ at
_Life & work in Dhaka city_
[writes](http://discoveringdhaka.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/eratic-electricity/)
about the cause of the power outages in Dhaka:

> Typical demand is 2000MW and one day this week we were allocated 1200W, so
> the shortfall had to be managed.

In Nepal, the power crisis has become a bit better. From an average of [14-16
hour load shedding](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/02/27/nepal-load-
shedding-woes/) a day the duration has come down. From Twitter:

> [zickme:](http://twitter.com/zickme) Country facing an Electricity crisis
> and to over come this Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has imposed a 12 hrs
> load shedding each day.

the plights of the people.

The residents of Karachi city in Pakistan are facing [unannounced power
outages of 8 to 10 hour](http://www.geo.tv/4-25-2009/40642.htm) everyday.

day by day.

South Asia has seen much worse heatwaves than this. But the power crisis has
really crippled peoples ability to cope with it. Until the rains bring some
respite people will continue to suffer.

From Dhaka, battered by the heat, Blogger _Kowshik_ is
[sarcastic](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/kowshikblog/28941558) [bn]:

> সরকারের এখন বিদ্যুৎ এর বদলে বৃষ্টি উৎপাদনের চেষ্টা করা উচিত

The government should try to produce rains instead of electricity.

Even if it sounds imprudent, in this situation the people of South Asia cannot
ignore this idea.
