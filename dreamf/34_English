Lebanon is in a [political
limbo](http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL2351911620071123?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews)
after parliament failed to elect a successor for President [Emile
Lahoud](http://www.answers.com/Emile%20Lahoud) today.  
Hours before the end of his term, Lahoud ordered the army to take charge of
security, leaving rival factions responsible for naming a president and
leading to international calls for calm.  
Lebanon's bloggers were quick to react, with _M Bashir_
[describing](http://urshalim.blogspot.com/2007/11/army-entrusted-with-
authority-to.html) the situation as follows:

> …so basically the situation can be summarized as follows: effectively at
> midnight tonight, Lebanon is without a president; the government (that is,
> granted its legitimacy is not contested) is resigned, the parliament’s
> session for electing a new president is postponed till the 30th of November,
> and the army is in charge of the security of the land.

_Mustapha_ further [clarifies](http://beirutspring.com/blog/2007/11/23/state-
of-emergencynot/) the situation on the ground and writes:

> An important clarification for outside observers who are overstating Mr.
> Lahhoud’s statement.  
>  The outgoing Lebanese President did NOT declare a state of Emergency or
> Martial law. The statement that caused the confusion was this: “the threats
> that require a state of emergency prevail over Lebanon”.  
>  What Mr. Lahhoud effectively did was assign the Army to take care of the
> security on the ground. A redundant procedure given that the Seniora
> government had already done that.  
>  If anything, the statement by the soon-to-be ex-President reveals his
> incapacity to do anything more serious. All comparisons with Pakistan,
> Jordan, or Egypt, where the Army heavy-handedly represses the people, should
> immediately be removed from your heads.

_Liliane_ , meanwhile,
[wonders](http://www.independence05.com/blog/2007/11/constitutional-or-not-
constitutional.html) whether what is happening in her country is
constitutional .. or not. She further adds that the day was the “most
contradictory” Lebanon has ever witnessed for the following reasons:

> 1- 109 Parliament members including opposition arrive to the parliament at
> noon.  
>  2- Session postponed till November 30th in order to elect a president
> agreed upon from all sides  
>  3- Post the canceled session, deputies talk back to each other through the
> media  
>  4- The Cabinet is in session since 6:30pm discussing the latest updates  
>  5- The president (till 11:59pm on November 23, 2007) Emile Lahoud declares
> a state of emergency starting 24 November 2007  
>  6- The Cabinet denies it, based on the constitution, explaining that only
> the cabinet after passing it to the parliament as well and the majority's
> signature can declare such state. (That was at 8:30 pm today)
