United States of Africa. The idea is not new. It was alive during the times of
[Kwame Nkrumah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah) of Ghana and
[Mwalimu Nyerere ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwalimu_Nyerere)of Tanzania.
Today, the idea is being pushed under the auspices of the African Union (AU).
Its most visible proponent is the Libyan Leader, Muammar Gaddafi.

July 1-3 [African Heads of State and Government met in
Accra](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/67327AAA-6CAD-4DB2-9CD5-AFBC7759C37C.htm),
Ghana for the 9th Ordinary Summit of the African Union. The item on the agenda
was the United States of Africa: the formation of a single government in
Africa. Muammar Gaddafi[ traveled by
road](http://allafrica.com/stories/200707021566.html), visiting several West
African states to garner support.

African bloggers were not silent about the summit and the idea of creating a
United States of Africa.

[_Grandiose Parlor_ wonders about Gaddafi's
motives](http://grandioseparlor.com/2007/06/gaddafi-goes-to-ghana-by-road/) in
pushing for a United States of Africa:

> He’s been calling for the unification of African nations under a “United
> States of Africa”. Another U.S.A?  
>  Is this a classic presentation of a grandiosely deluded mind? Or is Gaddafi
> simply manifesting his pan-African core?

While many bloggers doubt the possibility of a United State of Africa,
Branded, writing from Nairobi, Kenya, declares on his blog, _Business In
Focus_ , “the United States of Africa is already here.” He specifically looks
at two elements to make his point: trade and information technology. For
example, he notes that the mobile phone company operating in East Africa,
Celtel, has allowed its customers in the region to operate in a single network
at existing local rates.

Writing at [AfricanLoft](http://www.africanloft.com), Ugo Daniels sees the
path to a Federation of African States as [the most realist and practical path
for Africa](http://www.africanloft.com/united-states-of-africa-a-wishful-
thinking/):

> I want to say three things. First, yes, African countries should definitely

>  Would the leaders of northern African countries, [with the notable and
> admirable exception of President Ghadaffi], who admit to being African only
> when they need votes at the UN or for some other geo-political purposes,
> want a United Africa? I doubt it!! So let us be realistic and practical and
> think of a Federation of African States along the lines of the European
> Union. And we should get on with it now. Right now!!!  
>  Current African leaders are far lesser men that the African leaders who

> the homicidal maniac, Idi Amin.  
>  I have nothing but contempt for most of today’s African leaders who

The Cameroonian writer and activist, [Mwalimu George
Ngwane](http://www.gngwane.com/), argues that while the political and economic
trajectories of African integration have been developed, the cultural
component has not been explored, “…this has undermined the quest for an
African citizenship through a common language, a pan-African media organ, a
revised and harmonised education system, and a return to the organic concept
of co-existence and cooperation as it obtained before individualism and
exclusion became our new mantra.”

According to Ngwane, Africa should try [a voluntary approach to forming a
single government](http://www.gngwane.com/2007/06/the-cost-of-non.html):

> I, therefore, propose that if the Accra July summit fails to achieve a
> minimum consensus on the African Union government now, then we should
> abandon the holistic approach of trying to get all African countries to
> accept the one-off continental version and embark on the voluntary approach
> which requires countries or regions that are prepared to create a United
> States of Africa, to come together as nucleus members like it was in 1961
> among Ghana, Guinea and Mali. And when other citizens shall see the benefits
> accruing from these core members, they shall oblige their governments into
> associating with the United Africa architecture.

The blogger at Alnigeria finds the idea “[rather ridiculous at first
take](http://altnigeria.com/?p=113)“:

> When you however do a double, you discover there may be some merit to the
> idea. Those against this idea have probably narrowed the available options
> to mean, creating a duplicate of the system presently in place in the USA or
> even the EU. If the available alternatives include a flexible state with
> loose economic ties which encourage trading and production while maintaining
> sovereign governments which have enough power to make the system beneficial
> to the member states. Then the idea takes on a new lease of life. An idea
> also known as ‘A stronger AU’. I am not sure this is workable at the moment.
> Obviously this is an alternative way to look at the idea of a United States

Dave is not sure [if Africa is ready for such a
union](http://davespeaks.wordpress.com/2007/07/01/the-african-union/):

He supports [the idea of an African Central
Ban](http://davespeaks.wordpress.com/2007/07/01/the-african-union/)k:
