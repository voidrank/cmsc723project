More reactions are pouring out in the Pakistani blogosphere and elsewhere as
it settles in that a very strong and capable leader is no more. Some bloggers
are concerned about the law and order situation, providing personal accounts
of the violence on the streets. There is also a lot of speculation about the
impending elections, and the likely postponement. Taking the issue forward,
some blogs are discussing the legacy of Benazir Bhutto, the future for
Pakistan and the likely suspects who ordered the assassination, even as the
[Al Qaeda has claimed
responsibility](http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&article=461799&lng=1).

_[Red Diary](http://reddiarypk.wordpress.com/2007/12/28/benazir-
assassinated/)_ discusses why Bhutto was a target, and the resulting riots.

> The strong possibility of the rise of a secularist Benazir into power made
> her a mortal threat for those in the State who harbored sympathy for Islamic
> Fundamentalists, with whom the notorious intelligence agencies, such as the
> ISI, were closely knitted since the Cold War and the Afghan War. Benazir
> Bhutto become a symbol of resistance against Islamic Extremists – both
> residing inside and outside the State. She stood secularism and modernity
> against militant retrogressive and conservative trends.

Some bloggers assert that while they did not agree with Benazir Bhutto's
politics, or support her part – Pakistan Peoples Party, an attack such as this
is deeply tragic and reflects the turmoil that Pakistan is likely to find
itself in. _[Muslim Matters](http://muslimmatters.org/2007/12/27/benazir-
bhutto-killed-in-terrorist-attack/)_ calls it an act of terrorism, and
condemns violence as a tool of resolution.

> This is pure terrorism that must be condemned by all, religious or
> otherwise. If anyone had a problem with her politics, then the proper route
> is to use one’s pen and mind to argue against her ideology, not use the
> coward’s strategy of shutting up who you can’t argue with. Violence is the
> nemesis that will sink Pakistan if people don’t wake up and recognize its
> evil (both in an Islamic and social sense).

Echoing a similar point of view, [Ali Eteraz](http://eteraz.wordpress.com/)
writes an article on the _[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ali-
eteraz/behind-bhuttos-assassina_b_78434.html)_.

> Irrespective of one's views on Bhutto — mine were mostly negative — she was
> the primary secular-minded democratic leader of Pakistan. She had made
> statements about hunting Bin Laden, eradicating the pernicious madrassa
> system, as well as apologizing for allowing the Taliban to acquire power
> during her watch in the mid 90's. Her killing is a huge blow to the anti-
> extremist movement in Pakistan. Frankly, as it stands now, there are no
> other anti-extremist democratic leaders in Pakistan.

_[Metroblogging
Karachi](http://karachi.metblogs.com/archives/2007/12/escaping_chaos.phtml)_
has a post detailing the panic on the streets. _[Tabish
Bhimani](http://destogate.wordpress.com/2007/12/27/bhutto-assassinated-the-
aftermath-and-precautionary-measures/)_ focuses on the consequences of this
tragedy, and recommends that people take caution when venturing out of their
homes.

> What I am trying to say here is not that one of these individuals or
> organizations have committed a heinous crime, a murder, deciding the fate of
> not just a country, but of human beings; rather what I am trying to say is
> that there are an equal number of possibilities as to what happened and why
> and that we must reserve judgement. What happens in a country such as
> Pakistan, which is so famous in the international media, has global
> repercussions.

_[Teeth Maestro](http://www.teeth.com.pk/blog/2007/12/28/online-condolence-
book-for-benazir-bhutto/)_ who is providing constant updates on the event and
its aftermath, sets up an online condolence book for Benazir Bhutto.

> In an attempt to provide the online community and opportunity to offer their
> condolences to the grieving family and literally thousands of Peoples Party
> supporters I would like to initiate this condolence book for Benazir Bhutto.
> I will make it my own responsibility to present the entire list to the
> offices of the Pakistan Peoples Party to be attached with the main
> condolence book.
