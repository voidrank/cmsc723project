_Jonathan Segal_ , a Fiji-American, blogs about his [views on the current
American
election](http://blog.oceanic.com.fj/oceanic_user_experiences_/2008/03/digital-
talanoa.html "Digital Politics"). “If I was living in the US, I’d be sick and
tired of hearing about the elections all day… While in Fiji, however, I can
explore in my own time without experiencing the political-fatigue commonly
associated with listening to candidates speak.” He also makes a good review of
how each candidate uses digital media to convey their message across.
