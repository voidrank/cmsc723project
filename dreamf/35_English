Just a few hours ago, several
[Caribbean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) islands experienced strong
tremors from an earthquake that originated off the coast of
[Martinique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique) – and soon after
regional bloggers caught their breath and got over the initial shock, they
were on their computers blogging about the experience…

_[Steve's Dominica](http://steves-dominica.blogspot.com/)_ was first on the
ball – yesterday, his blog reported on “A Little Tremor”:

> 10:19am – a 4.8 ‘quake’ shook us. A little thing really, centered east of
> Martinique.

When the most recent tremors hit, however, his new post title quickly got
upgraded to _[“HUGE Tremor”](http://steves-dominica.blogspot.com/2007/11/huge-
termor.html)_ , followed by [a report on the specifics of the
‘quake](http://steves-dominica.blogspot.com/2007/11/73-quake.html):

> We were just rocked by a substantial earthquake – magnitude 7.3, centered
> not far west of Martinique. Now that's what I call scary – about 2 minutes
> of sustained shaking. Cars rocked, motorbike shook, water tank shook and
> slopped water… and Puss fled.

Further down the Caribbean archipelago, some Barbados blogs were also writing
about the experience. _[Barbados Underground](http://bajan.wordpress.com/)_
called the tremor “nerve wracking” and [provides a time
line](http://bajan.wordpress.com/2007/11/29/barbados-experience-earth-tremor/)
of what happened from beginning to end. _[Cheese-on-bread!](http://cheese-on-
bread.blogspot.com/2007/11/earth-tremor-hits-barbados.html)_ says that she
“had to exit the building hastily”, but as soon as she was allowed back on her
computer she provided [a more detailed account](http://cheese-on-
bread.blogspot.com/2007/11/earth-tremors-felt-in-barbados.html):

> Traffic is gridlocked, especially near the City, and there were reports of
> roof tiles falling from the _Royal Bank of Canada_ in Broad Street, damaging
> a car and blocking the street. Part of a house in the parish of St. George
> reportedly fell into a gully. People are in the streets and walking to open
> areas. The cellphone system is partially down so persons are having
> difficulty communicating. Some patients were also evacuated from the _Queen
> Elizabeth Hospital_. In Guadeloupe there are reports that a 3 year old girl
> was killed and her sister injured.

_[Caribbean
Lionesse](http://caribbeanlionesse.blogspot.com/2007/11/earthquake.html)_
describes it as “possibly the strongest earthquake in Barbados’ living
memory”, adding that “the whole island is still in a bit of a tizzy and on
edge”:

> I was sitting at my desk when I realised I felt dizzy or lightheaded – like
> my head was swimming. A few seconds later I heard my workmates shrieking and
> realised it was not just me. To be honest, I was in a panic. I just froze
> and clutched my desk, hoping it would pass but the ground just kept swaying
> and swaying and swaying. In my mind I was thinking “oh my god, we're still
> moving, why are we still moving?”

But after about forty-five minutes, she is able to post [a “funny” earthquake
update](http://caribbeanlionesse.blogspot.com/2007/11/funny-earthquake-
update.html):

> _Guardian General_ swooped in RIGHT AWAY and is sponsoring _Starcom_ radio's
> emergency broadcast on the earthquake. So every 15 minutes or so between
> nervy reports from town and around the region, you hear ‘ _Guardian General_
> – trust us to be there!’ Talk about marketing!

_[Notes From The Margin](http://notesfromthemargin.wordpress.com/)_ gives [an
insightful account of how people
reacted](http://notesfromthemargin.wordpress.com/2007/11/29/magnitude-73-earthquake-
hits-the-caribbean/), more concerned for the safety of their loved ones than
their own welfare:

> We all bolted for the door this afternoon as we felt and saw the ground
> shake beneath our feet. Everyone is asking what’s going on and no one
> appears to know. Calls on cell phones are met with “Network Busy”, calls on
> landlines are met with busy tones. No one is hurt but everyone is calling
> their loved ones to see that they are okay. People are sounding strained on
> the phone not because they are scared for themselves but because they fear
> for those dear to them. “My husband is on a construction site”, “My parents
> are on a plane coming in, will the airport be okay?” “I can’t get through to
> my children’s school I wonder if they are okay?”

Amit at _[Pull! Push!](http://pullpush.net/)_ says:

> Google is all over it…

He actually got on IM with me (I was entering [my own
post](http://www.newcheeze.com/blog/?p=131) about it at the time) and we
traded stories:

**Amit:** hi  
take it u heard/felt the quake?  
**me:** oh yes!! how bad was it in your neck of the woods?  
**Amit:** first time i felt a quake/shake.  
like being on a boat in the water.  
i was at home.  
**me:** we had a pretty scary one last year, but this one was way longer.  
**Amit:** i've got a full blog post up already. USGS says 7.3 around
martinique.  
**me:** incredible.  
apparently the aftershocks are expected to be quite strong  
**Amit:** good grief.  
**me:** i know.  
**Amit:** this is the first time in my entire life and for most bajans as well
i bet, that i've been through this.

_[Living Guyana](http://livinguyana.blogspot.com/2007/11/breaking-news-strong-
tremor-rocks.html)_ reports feeling the effects of the tremor:

> For a few seconds at approximately 3:04pm this afternoon a strong tremor
> rocked houses and other buildings on coastland Guyana. The tremor sent
> persons scattering out of their homes, offices and other buildings in
> Georgetown as people became scared and ran onto the streets.

_[West Indies Cricket Blog](http://caribbeancricket.com/weblog/?p=3956)_ also
weighed in:

> A massive earthquake (7.3 on Richter scale) rocked the Caribbean today,
> sending tremors as far as Guyana and Suriname in South America. The
> earthquake was centered 23 miles southeast of Roseau, the capital of
> Dominica, where the shaking lasted for about 20 seconds.

As the people of the Caribbean brace themselves for possible aftershocks,
