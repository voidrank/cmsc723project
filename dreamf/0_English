He was found dead outside his gate at the Sunlight estate in Nairobi’s
Lang’ata area, on Monday (today) morning. His family had reported him missing
on Friday evening. Police are currently investigating the cause of his death.

Bantu was also a very vocal political and human rights activist and a cultural
theorist who worked mostly with civil society using theatre and performance in
human rights and developmental work.  
The news was first broken publicly online on a news website by one of the
leading Kenyan media companies.

However, a Kenyan Writers group on Google were the first to inform writers,
critics and Bantu’s comrades of this tragedy.

Renee Mboya, an artist working with Dreamaker Africa in providing Economic
solutions for the arts posted this on the forum.

> Just to say Rest in Peace Bantu Mwaura. Anyone got details…something  
>  about a car jacking on Langata Road. :-(

Other renown Kenyan writers and poets who have worked with Bantu on numerous
occasions such as Rasna Warah, Muthoni Garland, Shailja Patel, Al Kags,
Binyavanga Wainanina, Phillo Ikonya, Neema Mawiyo and Simiyu Barasa were
equally dumbfounded by the news as scanty details of his death tickled in.

It is still not yet clear, what or who killed him.

Although the news of Bantu’s death did not receive any slot on any of the
Local TV station’s prime time news, many bloggers, online forums and groups
are conveying their condolences as they reminiscence their past encounters
with him.

[KenyanPoet ](http://www.kenyanpoet.blogspot.com/)says this on her blog:

> I got to know Bantu through the monthly Kwani open Mic nights in its early
> days where he never failed to read one or two of his poetry. Most of his
> poetic work was in criticism of the Kenyan Political scene through sarcasm.  
>  A fellow thespian and activist, Phillo Ikonya who is also the President of
> PEN International Kenya conveyed her deep shock as she wrote the news to a
> Google forum for poets of which I am a member.
>
> My heart goes out to his Family at this time. I will post more information
> as I receive it.

[Peter Kimani, ](http://eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1144012702&cid=159&)a
journalist with the Standard group, says this about Bantu’s death

[The Nairobi Chronicle,](http://nairobichronicle.wordpress.com/) an on-line
journal based in the city of Nairobi, Kenya posted this:

[CapitalFM,](http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Local/Culturalist-Bantu-Mwaura-
is-dead-4185.html) a Kenyan radio station has also posted the news of Bantu’s
Death in a story written by Bernard Momanyi:

> Dr Mwaura died on Sunday night but many of his friends and former students
> at the University of Nairobi said they learnt of the death on Monday
> afternoon.
>
> “I cannot believe Dr Mwaura is dead, he was such a good lecturer. He taught
> me two years ago,” a former student at the University of Nairobi said.

It is clear from the comments posted in the various online spaces that many
have not yet come to terms with this tragedy.

[St. Lawrence University ](http://www.stlawu.edu/ucomm/mwaura.html)where Bantu
Mwaura was an adjunct faculty member have created a [Memorial Web
Page](http://web.stlawu.edu/ucomm/mwaura_comments.html) for all those wishing
to send in their condolences

Indeed, Kenya has been robbed of one of the greatest minds to ever grace our
literary scene, human rights platform and lecture halls.  
Below is one of Bantu’s poems:

> **The Politician**
>
> This donkey is a politician  
>  It don't care  
>  It kicks it owner  
>  Who voted for it!  
>  Toils hard to get kickbacks  
>  From every deal  
>  At the expense of its owner  
>  The voter  
>  This politician is a donkey  
>  It don't care
>
> …
>
> This politician is a praying mantis  
>  It prays and teases  
>  To mate with the male!  
>  But soon as it sucks life's juices  
>  It snaps off the life of its lover  
>  This praying mantis is a politician

**(*All poems’ rights remain with the author)**

Bantu leaves behind his wife, Susan Bantu and 2 daughters, Makeba in honor the
late South African diva, Miriam Makeba and
[Mekatilili](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekatilili_Wa_Menzal), in memory of
the Kenyan heroine who led the Giriama in resisting the British invasion at
the turn of the 20th century.
