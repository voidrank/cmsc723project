On Monday, riot police in Moscow arrested dozens of people who attempted to
take part in an unauthorized post-election protest rally.

Marina Litvinovich (LJ user _abstract2001_ , an aide to [Garry
Kasparov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov)) was one of those who
got detained. Here's part of what she
[wrote](http://abstract2001.livejournal.com/716186.html) (RUS) following her
release:

> I'm home, yes.
>
> Briefly: my arm is bruised, my glasses broken, I was upside down when they
> threw me into the riot police bus, [hit] my head on the stairs a bit. Not
> the best way to enter a bus.
>
> Inside my bus […] there were mainly those who got detained at McDonald's.
> Riot police burst into [the McDonald's] and snatched people out. They seized
> those who [had nothing to do with the rally], too. We had two underaged
> [schoolkids]. Also, God forgive me, there were two [members of the pro-
> Kremlin youth movement Nashi] on our bus. Nice kids, who quickly enough
> [received a political orientation] from other detainees ;) Well, and the
> situation [was as good as any political orientation], too… […]

Sergei Davidis (LJ user _blacky_sergei_ ) [wrote this](http://blacky-
sergei.livejournal.com/44270.html) (RUS) about the election and the Moscow
rally:

> **Sad…**

> The election has made me sad somehow. Not because of Medvedev's victory – it

> was evident in Moscow, for example. Shameless [falsifications], mass voting

> There are no rules that these jerks are prepared to respect, and it makes me

> And then there's also the Dissenters’ March today. It wasn't enough that

> enough that they packed the whole neighborhood with cops. It wasn't enough
> that they were grabbing anyone who tried to chant or attracted too much
> media attention. But they were also seizing people who committed no

> [Alexanyan](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/02/09/russia-an-

LJ user _ilugru_ described (RUS) [a march of his
own](http://ilugru.livejournal.com/41560.html) – a one-person protest rally of
sorts:

> I left work earlier, but still too late to really take part in the event –
> by 5:50 PM they had detained nearly everyone they could detain, there was a
> hellish crowd of cops by Turgenevskaya [subway station], the remnants of the
> protesters and a crowd of journalists. I didn't encounter anyone I knew and
> decided to carry out a tiny individual march. Good thing [[The New
> Times](http://newtimes.ru/), a Russian-language weekly] had made a really
> good pre-election issue, which consisted mainly of pages full of slogans. I
> opened the page with the words “Vote or not, [you'll still get a male
> reproductive organ]…” and walked along Myasnitskaya St. towards Lubyanka,
> holding it close to me. I didn't run into riot police along the way,
> [regular] cops were looking intensely [at me], some were making steps
> towards me, but no one [really got me]. At the square near the Solovetsky
> Stone [[Lubyanka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubyanka_Square)], I saw a
> really amusing scene – hordes of cops were guarding all entrances to the
> square, which was occupied by six (!) people gloomily waving flags of the
> [pro-Kremlin Young Russia youth movement]. […] I would give a lot to listen
> to the thoughts of the big riot police guys who had to stand along the
> perimeter, guarding these clowns.

In St. Petersburg, the post-election protest rally was an authorized one – and
it actually did take place. One of the protesters, LJ user _aneta_spb_ ,
[wrote this](http://aneta-spb.livejournal.com/650456.html) (RUS) on her blog:

> It was good. But not much. It's clear that in the nearest future we will not
> see tens of thousands of protesters. […]
