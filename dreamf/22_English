[The BBC posted an
interview](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7242832.stm) with head of
Reporters Without Borders Leonard Vincent commenting on the decline of press
freedom in Africa over the past year.

[Ugandan Insomniac](http://ugandaninsomniac.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/getting-
it-right-saying-it-wrong/) was the first to discuss it:

> Vincent’s response, in my opinion, was typical of the misunderstanding of
> African statehood, international affairs and democracy.

She quoted some of the interview, with special emphasis on parts she found
especially difficult to swallow:

> VINCENT: Two major factors for me is that first of all, is the fact that
> **there is this sort of African pride in the culture, in the political
> culture, that has been renewed this year and more and more over the years
> makes it difficult for western countries to intervene in internal affairs of
> their** **former colonies**.  
>

Meanwhile,[ AfricaFlack](http://africaflak.blogspot.com/) offered another
angle:

> RSF Secretary-General Robert Menard knows the cure. The leaders of the so-
> called league of democracies and international institutions must stand up
> for common values. One underlying reason for this reluctance – at least for
> the “democracies” – is business, Menard argues. Who wants to offend China’s
> leaders about imprisoning cyber journalists when their market is so big? Who
> wants to offend Russian President Vladimir Putin when oil is so important?

> Let’s get back to Africa and its dark year of 2007. One reason so many
> African countries became so brazen in their repression of the media: the
> rise of Chinese power on the continent along with the corresponding loss of
> legitimacy of the continent’s former colonial powers.

But back on the Insomniac's blog, tempers – and
[comments](http://ugandaninsomniac.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/getting-it-right-
saying-it-wrong/) – flared.

> @God: Why did you make the West? Why, why, why, why? Why did you make them

> Vincent is saying it wrong, especially up there about African pride. He also

> where Western governments are all over the place the same thing does happen.
> It’s a matter of who is playing who. Eg, while Rwanda has been putting off
> France, they’ve been dancing with American and British money. But the media

> only a few years from now that RWB of this world will be noticing.

Discussions of media freedom – and more so what is reported about Africa –
never fail to incite a plethora of opinions, though it is doubtful the RWB
will respond to the voices all over the blogosphere.
