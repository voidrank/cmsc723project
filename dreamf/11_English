Bahraini blogger and human rights activist _[Abdulla
Mohsen](http://bahraineyes.blogspot.com/)_ (Ar) has been [behind
bars](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7268820.stm) for more than four
months, according to _[Nido](http://nidomilk.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/abdulla-
mohsen/)_.

_Nido_ explains:

> Abdulla Mohsen has been in prison now more than four months. What is he
> accused of? Well apparently he and more than thirty others are accused of
> being involved in the theft of a weapon and in burning a police jeep. This,
> if you will remember, happened way back in December after the protest that
> accompanied the funeral of Ali Jassem, who died in as yet unclear
> circumstances after participating in a demonstration on December 17. Dozens
> of people were arrested, including Abdulla.

_Nido_ adds, that the blogger's health is a cause of concern. He writes:

> In any case, several sources indicated that Abdulla’s health situation is a
> constant worry. Apparently he is suffering from severe kidney problems, and
> his family are very worried about his situation. At one point he even had to
> be moved to the hospital due to his deteriorating health. His family have
> been kept in the dark with minimal information about his status or
> whereabouts.

What is infuriating _Nido_ most, however, is the total lack of empathy from
bloggers and online activists to Abdulla's plight. He says:

> The situation is very depressing. There are several reports of torture and
> beatings of the detainees. There isn’t much that we can do except bring
> attention to Abdulla’s and the rest of the detainees’ plight. Other than the
> Arabic forums, there has been very little coverage or discussion online
> about their situation, unlike previous cases of bloggers being arrested or
> brought to prosecution. If you have a blog or a forum or even a contact
> somewhere, I ask you that you please write about them, put a post up, or at
> least raise their issue. This is the least we can do, as one can only
> imagine what they are going through.

_[Chanad Bahraini](http://chanad.weblogs.us/?p=538)_ picks off where _Nido_
left and writes:

> As Nido points out, Abdullah would not hurt a fly, and the charges against
> him are clearly cooked up. I got to know him at the countless protests and
> demonstrations he attended, always in his dark suit and white shirt (no
> tie), quiet, very polite, and an extremely nice guy.

He also draws our attention to another activist behind bars – Hassan Abdulnabi
– and says:

> Another regular activist who has been detained is Hassan Abdulnabi. I have
> only met him once, but always saw him at the protests. He was always at the
> frontlines doing his best to prevent any conflict between the riot police
> and the demonstrators. He has been in and out of jail because of his
> activities with the Unemployment Comittee, and was seriously injured at
> least once after being attacked by riot police in 2005, leaving him on
> crutches for several weeks.
>
> Once again he faces state violence.

_Chanad_ goes further and adds:

> Obviously, the men have been rounded up not because there is any evidence
> against them, but because they dared to speak out. They will hopefully be
> released eventually — but not without first giving them, and other potential
> activists, something to think about before speaking out again.

_Abdulla Mohsen_ , who is still awaiting trial, is not in jail for his
blogging activities. The _[Bahrain Human Rights
Centre](http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/)_ has been active in
[calling](http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/node/1904) for Mohsen's release,
along with the other activists rounded up after the December protests. The
centre itself is banned in Bahrain and its website is blocked.
