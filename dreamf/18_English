[FOKO Blog Club](http://club.foko-madagascar.org/) is the outreach arm of
[FOKO](http://www.foko-madagascar.org), a project committed to the development
of Madagascar. From the [FOKO website](http://www.foko-
madagascar.org/?page_id=8):

> FOKO was born a few days after [TED Global conference: “Africa the next
> Chapter”, when TED Fellow ](http://www.ted.com/themes/view/id/45 "TED
> Africa")[Andriankoto](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=11) and his
> fellow bloggers [Mialy](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=14),
> [Lova](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=13), and
> [Joan](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=12) decided to push further
> their cyber-activism by banking on their talents with the [FOKO
> project](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=60) to contribute ideas
> that will support Madagascar’s development.

Rather than the Malagasy people and culture, it is most often the biodiversity
and famous lemurs of Madagascar which take the international spotlight. FOKO
wants to shift the focus to the Malagasy people and make them a crucial factor
in their unique and threatened environment. Their goal is to focus on one
village (Kelilalina) in the Southeastern region of Madagascar, with one of
their goals being to [help save their
forests](http://blog.ted.com/2007/08/fighting_slasha.php).

Foko has [many diversified projects](http://www.foko-
madagascar.org/?page_id=60) and one of them is the [Foko Blog
Club](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?cat=10), which started last August to
teach blogging skills to young people in Madagascar. In a society where elders
are given preference, people are not used to listening to the younger
generation, although they represent 75% of the population. Foko wants to
encourage more Malagasy youngsters to share their stories and integrate
blogging into their educational and professional development. FOKO also hosted
the [Best of Malagasy Blogs](http://www.bestofmalagasyblogs.com/) competition
contest in November 2007 and organizes monthly blogger meetups. Meet the club
team members [here](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=61).

Malagasy internet users are predominantly users of different online forums
where they raise their voices fairly independently but while being comfortably
supported by the online community. [_Serasera_](http://forum.serasera.org/) is
a popular Malagasy-language discussion forum based in Antananarivo, the
capital of Madagascar with over 400 active members. FOKO Blog club with the
help of the Rising Voices Micro grant will outreach to this active community
of internet forumists and teach them how to participate in the global
community of blogs, podcasts, and online video and thus enabling them to
engage in the global conversation.

In their [project
proposal](https://wiki.rising.globalvoicesonline.org/Bringing%20Malagasy%20Forumists%20to%20the%20world%20of%20Citizen%20Journalism)
submitted to Rising Voices, they emphasized:

> Twice a month, we will have sessions with a group of forumists. They are
> actually very internet savvy but for lack of connectivity (costly, slow and
> subject to electricity outage) they are not blogging and think the Internet
> is reduced to chat forums. Most of the forums are held in Madagascar, we
> want to expand outside of the Malagasy forum world and reach out worldwide.

[FOKO's projects goals](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?p=175) are:

> * Promoting citizen journalism in Madagascar specifically by encouraging
> forumists to write blog posts.
> * Using digital media as a tool for educational purposes for students.
> * Promoting the use of digital media for educational purposes by students
> who do not have regular access to the internet.

On January 26, the Foko Blog Club
[arranged](http://www.purplecorner.com/?p=216) their first workshop of the
year (4th of its kind) in the cyber cafe Teknet in Antananarivo to introduce
blogging to the participants. In the [FOKO project blog on Rising
Voices](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/foko/2008/01/31/bringing-
malagasy-forumists-to-blogging/) _Joan Razafimaharo_ shares the challenges in
achieving their goal:

> The idea of publishing ideas on one’s own and taking a personal position on
> each post could have understandably scared some of them. Our team did their
> best to make them feel at ease and showed them the basics of blogging in
> each session.

“Pro” Malagasy bloggers also showed up to help out with logistics and at the
same time other overseas-based bloggers connected on the
[chatroom](http://club.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=50) and offered support
and tips.

And soon all were witnessing the results:

> It took only one hour for the first posts to start showing up. FOKO members
> had not even yet mentioned Citizen Journalism and the Rising Voices
> tutorials translated into [French
> ](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/library/Introduction%20aux%20m%C3%A9dias%20citoyen.pdf)
> (and soon in Malagasy) that spontaneously all the blogs showed they had
> caught on the spirit of what it means to **rise ones’ voices** :
>
> 13 year-old _**[FCandy](http://fcandy.wordpress.com/)**_ very wisely posts
> about the latest news from her Ambohimanarina popular neighborhood.
>
> Hard working _**[Sasa](http://sasa.blaogy.com/)**_ tells us funny stories
> about people she meets everyday on her way home .
>
> Stunningly **_[Avylavitra](http://gazetyavylavitra.wordpress.com/)_**
> showcases pictures of the impact of last week’s FAME cyclone which did many
> destructions in town …
>
> Some issues were raised : **_[Blanche07](http://blanche07.blaogy.com/)_**
> explained how difficult it was to find Internet connection,
> **_[Pakysse](http://http/pakysse.wordpress.com/)_ **wanted to learn how to
> embed sounds and videos into posts, and 10-year-old **_[Miora
> Stéphanie](http://rmstephy.wordpress.com/)_** needed more time. **Many more
> bloggers-to-be were waiting for their turn in the hallway**.”

The FOKO [facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5263523055&ref=mf) already has
200+ members and the initiative was recently featured in [Blog
Her](http://www.blogher.com/foko-madagascar-it-takes-village-raise-idea) .

FOKO is soon expanding to Madagascar's second biggest town, Tamatave. It will
now host two blogging sessions per month instead of one and more friends from
the [Namana Serasera group](http://serasera.org/namana/) will attend the
workshops to facilitate. We will be following this unique project and see how
it brings about changes.
