One conservation organization in Paramaribo, Suriname, is putting its efforts
into rescuing wildlife and preserving their habitat. Started in 2005 by
Monique Pool, [Green Heritage Fund
Suriname](http://www.greenfundsuriname.org/) advocates for animal rights by
educating people.

While Suriname is a lush country, city areas impacted by deforestation are
pushing animals out. The Green Heritage Fund is working to help those animals
— sloths, mostly — as well as preserve the ecosystems for dolphins and other
marine life.

Global Voices spoke with Pool about the important work her organization does.

**Global Voices (GV): Tell us about Green Heritage Fund Suriname. What's a
typical work day like?**

> **Monique Pool (MP):** I think most people think we are either running
> behind sloths and anteaters, or maybe watching dolphins all day. I wish…but
> actually, we have a lot of tasks. We plan for new activities and then in
> between, we get calls for rescues. Sometimes we have one rescue a week and
> sometimes we have two rescues in one day.

 **GV: Tell us about some of these activities, and your goals as a non-
profit.**

> **MP:** We have four programs. The Xenarthra Program is basically the
> rescue, rehabilitation and release of wildlife. It’s also about [preserving]
> the ecosystem that they live in, to ensure that there’s enough left. We’re
> not just the normal conservation organization. We’re also looking more and
> more at the wildlife welfare of animals that are losing their habitat,
> especially in the city.
>
> The second program is the Dolphin Program. While that's the one species the
> program is focusing on, we also started looking at the broader picture — all
> the animals that share the ecosystem with this dolphin and the health of
> that ecosystem. Together with [WWF Guianas](http://www.wwfguianas.org/), the
> Nature Conservation Division of the Suriname Forest Service, and the
> [Protected Areas Commission](https://www.facebook.com/Protected-Areas-
> Commission-314675811967929/) of Guyana, we’re actually implementing a
> regional Marine Spatial Planning project. In the end, the aim for that
> program is to have a marine protected area.
>
> Our third program is Education and Research. For us, education is the main
> focus of what we do because we feel if you don’t raise awareness or don’t
> educate people, you will never be able to protect areas. Education is a
> really important part of our efforts. It’s cutting through all of our
> programs and education, of course, includes advocacy.
>
> The fourth program is Green Community Development. If the community invites
> us, we help them look for alternative ways of earning money.

**GV: Why did you decide to focus your energies on the well-being of sloths?**

> **MP:** It’s more or less of a coincidence that we started doing that. I had
> lost my dog and while I was looking for him through the Animal Protection
> Society, I volunteered to take care of a baby sloth. Then I started becoming
> interested in why specifically sloths were being reported [to the Animal
> Protection Society] so much. We started focusing more on that whole group
> because they are very special animals — not just the sloths, but also
> anteaters. I became more and more curious, and started looking online for
> resources.

**GV: How have development and deforestation impacted the lives of sloths in
Suriname?**

> **MP:** All wildlife that shares the habitat with the sloths are affected
> when there is deforestation — but sloths are so slow, they cannot get away.
> The moment the machines start coming in, the monkeys will flee, the birds
> will go away, the snakes will leave because of the ground moving in a
> certain way. The animals will be gone, with the exception of the animals
> that are too slow to do that. These include the sloths, the silky anteaters
> (small anteaters that live very high in the trees), and the tree porcupines.
>
> When we do the rescues, those are the animals that we mostly catch. We
> normally release all healthy animals within a week.
>
> Deforestation is happening in the interior where there is illegal gold
> mining, but those areas are already heavily hunted, so there is not that
> much wildlife. Most of our animals come from the coastal zone, with maybe
> 96% coming specifically from the city.

**GV: How do you care for the sloths once they come to the sanctuary?**

> **MP:** First, we assess their health status. If they are healthy, we
> release them within two to three days. Because of the hunting going on in
> Suriname, we normally do releases [in areas we deem safe].
>
> [For injured animals], the most challenging part is providing food that they
> will eat. Once the animals eat, you can provide the full treatment they need
> before releasing them. But if they refuse to eat, they will die, even if
> they get the treatment; then, we need to make a decision about what to do.
> Sometimes we will release an animal if we see that being in the forest and
> being able to take care of itself will heal it. But we don’t do that very
> often — almost never — because a weak animal or injured animal is just food
> for predators.

**GV: What is the most difficult aspect of your work?**

> **MP:** When we have an animal that is really badly injured, the most
> difficult part is having to deal with people’s awareness about what they did
> to the animal. I remember this one animal — people had caught a two-fingered
> sloth because they wanted to eat it. Then they thought it was pregnant and
> because they didn’t want to eat a pregnant animal, they tied it up and let
> it sit in their yard. After maybe ten days, they called us. The wire had
> completely ruptured through the flesh of its leg and we had to euthanize the
> animal after we brought it to the vet.
>
> For a week or more, the volunteer and I…we just couldn’t sleep thinking
> about that. It’s not just dealing with the suffering of the animals, but the
> ignorance of the people. That really gets me most, the ignorance.

**GV: Conversely, what is the most fulfilling part of what you do?**

> **MP:** It’s an incredible thing that I am living in a country where these
> special animals live, where we can see them in the wild and where they still
> have reasonably untouched habitats. It’s just something I appreciate very
> much, that I live here — not just where sloths live, but also where these
> amazing dolphins live. It’s something I’m very grateful for. I’m grateful
> that I can speak on their behalf and help protect their habitat.

**GV: How can people help your organization and the work that it carries
out?**

> **MP:** There are two ways. One is to spend time, helping and volunteering
> with us. There can also be volunteering from a distance. There is a form on
> our website, where it says
> [‘Volunteer’](http://www.greenfundsuriname.org/en/volunteer/). People can
> fill out their name, tell us what their skills are and how they want to help
> us. For example, our website administrator lives in the United States.
>
> The other thing, of course, is donations. We live off of donations. That
> would help continue this work.

**GV: How do you use social media to gain support and raise awareness?**

> **MP:** We use social media to emphasise our message ‘a wild animal belongs
> in the wild’, and we use the
> [#notapet](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%23notapet) hashtag in a
> lot of our posts. We actively use [our Facebook
> page](https://www.facebook.com/Green-Heritage-Fund-
> Suriname-129859957040929/) to raise certain issues and we have used social
> media to promote a petition we started in 2011 and [repeated in
> 2013](https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/verbod-verkoop-wilde-dieren.html)
> to fight against the selling of wildlife in the streets.

 **GV: Is there anything people may not realise about the kind of conservation
work you do?**

> **MP:** One thing that is really good for people to know is that we do not
> keep animals in enclosures. There are a lot of people who call and say, ‘We
> want to come and see the animals’, or want to touch them. We don’t have
> animals in cages. We absolutely don’t do hugging. We ourselves even limit
> how much we touch the animals. Sloths are solitary animals, so they are not
> used to social interactions, even within their species — so you can imagine
> how other types of interaction can be very stressful for them.
>
> Instead, we take people on releases because we have so many rescues and
> releases. It’s often a very beautiful moment, because you can see when they
> are sitting in a cage [on the way to being released], these animals get
> really depressed. Once you release them, you can actually see how their
> energy changes; how they get off into the forest, and it’s really amazing to
> see that. We allow people to take as many pictures as they want, because of
> course this is what we want to promote — that wild animals belong in the
> wild.
