Roly poly dolls

Have you ever seen a roly poly doll? They are also called tumbler dolls, or
wobbly man dolls. They have round heads, round bottoms and no limbs. When you
push the doll, it wobbles for a bit but never falls down.

There’s a version made by ethnic minorities in Vietnam — colorful and
crocheted. And now there’s another version, made exclusively by one political
prisoner: Nguyen Đang Minh Man.

Man Minh

Nguyen Đang Minh Man is a 31-year-old photojournalist and beautician who is
currently serving her fifth year in prison. She was
[sentenced](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2014/12/11/jailed-female-photo-
journalist-on-hunger-strike-in-vietnam/) to eight years on charges of
subversion. Her mother, Đặng Ngọc Minh, is a former prisoner of conscience,
who was arrested at the same time as her daughter, but was released much
earlier.

Ngọc Minh recalls the time that she and Minh Mẫn learned how to make the dolls
while in pretrial detention.

> We were brought to Nghệ An, at Nghi Kim camp. There were some ethnic
> minorities there, and they make these dolls, but they were kinda ugly! But
> they showed us how to make it.

Each doll is unique and wears a different outfit. They are the size of your
palm, with striking details like eyelashes and tiny butterflies and flowers
stitched on their hats. One doll wears a hat that’s flipped up in a coquette-
ish fashion. Another one is very festive — decked out in red and green, her
two braids tied with red ribbon with the words “Merry Christmas” threaded
across her little body.

But arts and crafts get tricky when you’re being held in a detention center.
Ngọc Minh talks about gathering the materials to make the dolls:

> The thing is, when we learned how to make them, we were at a detention
> center so we didn’t really have materials. When we wanted to practice making
> them, we had to use the threads from our bath towels. That doesn’t look very
> good though, when you pull out those threads. But when we were transferred
> to a different detention center, there were many prisoners working on
> embroidery, and they gave us their leftover thread – all different colors.
> And we found some cotton too, so we stuffed their stomachs.

Minh Mẫn went on a doll making frenzy. She made one for every occasion – one
for Christmas, one for her mom’s birthday, one for her parents’ wedding
anniversary.

At the prison that Minh Mẫn and her mother were held, inmates are kept apart
from each other and completely barred from going outdoors. Reading materials
are highly regulated and inmates risk solitary confinement for any perceived
misconduct. The roly poly dolls became a therapeutic source of creativity and
distraction.

When her mom was about to be released, Minh Mẫn passed a bunch along for her
to take home. The prison guards got suspicious and demanded to cut open the
dolls, to make sure it was not a ploy to sneak something out of prison.
However, they found nothing in the stomachs of the dolls except cotton. What
the authorities didn’t realize was the messages the dolls bear were right in
front of their faces — they just couldn’t comprehend them.

Ngọc Minh tells Loa the ‘secret’ message in the dolls:

> One has the flag of the Republic of Vietnam and she embroidered my English
> name, Ammy on it, along with my birthday, April 4th, next to the word
> Freedom, the white flower, and a cute butterfly on my hat.

The white flower, hoa mai, that appears on many of Minh Mẫn’s roly poly dolls
represents the symbol of the pro-democracy party Việt Tân, and serves as a
message of solidarity for those fighting alongside her beyond prison walls.
Minh Mẫn, like her mom, is a member.

Some of the dolls

Another doll is dressed in black, with the letter T and the number 4
embroidered on the body: the T stands for “tháng,” or month, and the 4 stands
for the month of April. This doll, Ngọc Minh says, commemorates tháng tư đen,
Black April – otherwise known as April 30th or the fall of Sàigon. The family
had attempted but failed to flee Vietnam after the war.

Ngọc Minh wanted to share her daughter’s cute and meaningful creations with
the world, so after her release, she posted pictures of them on Facebook.
People from around the world began to comment and notice the dolls. That’s
when the authorities banned Ngọc Minh and her husband from bringing any more
dolls home after prison visits.

But this is not the only time international attention Minh Mẫn has received
international attention. Three months ago, in September, the United Nations
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention
[declared](http://www.mediadefence.org/news/victory-fight-freedom-expression-
vietnam) that Minh Mẫn “was detained solely for the peaceful exercise of her
rights”. They called for her immediate
[release](https://barsforblogging.com/representative/).

And while Minh Mẫn is still behind bars at Prison Camp 5 in Thanh Hóa, during
their November family visit, Ngọc Minh said they have noticed a slight change
in behavior among the authorities. Ngọc Minh recounts:

> She and her dad were talking through the glass partition on the phone. He
> said to her ‘The UN told the Vietnamese Government to release you
> unconditionally. I’m letting you know this, but don’t rush to hold too much
> hope, because at the end of the day it is still up to the State.
> Organizations and people all around the world are speaking up for your
> freedom.’ In the past, whenever we spoke about matters related to the case,
> they stopped us immediately. But this time, they didn’t stop us! All five of
> the prison guards standing watch did not say a word.

Ngọc Minh says that she and her family just wish for Minh Mẫn to return home.
They don’t want her to receive political asylum and be exiled to another
country. She says that they want to fight together as a family for a free
Vietnam, in Vietnam.

And if the authorities fear letting some roly poly dolls leave prison, one can
only imagine how they feel about setting Minh Mẫn free.
