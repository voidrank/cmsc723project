Li Tie points out that in China hijacking a gmail account password [only takes
10 seconds](http://www.bullogger.com/blogs/litie/archives/353326.aspx) if the
user has connected his/her account with mobile phone. Once the password
recovery was sent to the mobile, the security police can get hold of the
account information.
