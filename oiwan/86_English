“My Father is Li Gang!” has become the most popular catchphrase in the Chinese
Internet in the past few days.

First of all, you may ask, who is Li Gang? Li Gang is the deputy director of
the police department in the northern district of Baoding city, Hebei
province.

On October 16, a car accident took place in Hebei University, which led to the
death of a female student. According to eyewitnesses, the car knocked down two
girls who were riding roller on the school campus, but the driver did not stop
and continued to drive to the female dormitory to drop off his girl friend. In
the end, the school security guards and students blocked the entrance of the
school gate and demanded the driver to get off the car. Instead of showing any
sign of remorse, the driver, Li Qiming, yelled out to the angry crowd, “Go
ahead and sue me, my father is Li Gang!”. Below is a photo showing the car
accident scene:

What is the underlying meaning of the sentence: “My Father is Li Gang!”? Many
netizens believe it reflects the arrogance of the offsprings of government
officials (the so-called G2-official) that they could easily get away with any
mistake or crime that they have committed. They are outraged by such inherited
corruption and expressed their anger online. The greatest hit about this
incident is the following music video:

The vehicle flies in the middle of the road,  
My powerful parents are offsprings of this yellow earthland.  
I have an ordinary face, but my father is the head of a bureau.  
He is a big tree and can cover the sky with his hand, he also has mysterious
power.  
My father is Li Gang, the deputy head of Public Security.  
A person has died and so what?  
God let my father to head a bureau, my father is Li Gang  
A person has died but it won't affect our position  
Why? Because my father is a bureau head  
The blood coming out from the crash, so bright and so red  
If my flying vehicle could bring away my alumni, let her fly away.

Yesterday, I read the news about a second generation government official
running over people and causing one death. I was very angry. Earlier on, we
have the “70m” case about second generation rich, now we have another case
about second generation official. He did not care about the girls he crashed
into, but blamed them for damaging his car. I am so angry. A living being is
nothing compared to his vehicle. The indifference of this second generation
official is inhumane. What's more, after he crashed the two girls, he
continued to drive to the dormitory to pick up his girl friend without any
sense of guilt. When he was stopped by the school security, the moron yelled
out “my father is Li Gang!”. The scene reminds me of a movie “Western
Journey”: when one yells out the spell of “Holy monkey”, one could be saved.
However, your father is not holy monkey, he is just a deputy head of some
police bureau. But the fact that he chose to yell out this spell shows that
such spell has been very powerful. You yelled out the phrase because the area
is under your father's jurisdiction. However, you have underestimated the
power of public opinion. You ignorant kid, this spell will not only bring you
down, but also your father. If you could keep a low profile, such spell may
work for 3 to 5 more years. Once you yelled out, it lost its effect. Not
mentioning the fact that your father is only a deputy head, he could not save
you even if he was from higher ranks. One spit from each person in the country
can drown you and this catchphrase will probably become the greatest hit this
year.

On Wednesday October 20, MOP user, Asshole wetman, made a public call for
poetry writings with the catchphrase “My Father is Li Gang!”. So far [there
are more than 350
submissions](http://dzh.mop.com/topic/main/readSubMain_12596151_0.html). The
most circulated ones are reiterations of _Thoughts in a Still Night_ , poem by
Tang dynasty poet Li Bai. Below is one of the reiterated versions:

> 床前明月光  
>  疑似地上霜  
>  举头汪保安  
>  我爹叫李钢

The luminous moonshine before my bed,  
Is thought to be the frost fallen on the ground.  
I lift my head to yell at the security gard,  
My father is Li Gang.

Apart from songs and poems, there are short stories and pictures based on the
catchphrase. One example is an imagined conversation between two people in a
buffet queue:

> Give me more rice, my father is Li Gang!  
>  God damn it, why my father is not Li Gang!

Another widely circulated photo is a software generated advertisement

sale!](http://ss8.sinaimg.cn/bmiddle/64a4495ax9321325123c7&690)

While the incident keeps spreading across the internet in various media forms,
the Hebei University school authority started pressuring students to keep
quiet. According to a famous journalist microblogger, Wang Keqin, many student
eyewitnesses of the incident have been
[summoned](http://t.sina.com.cn/1700757973/wr0qxJiZ08) by the school
authority. Now it has become very difficult for the reporters to follow up on
the issue and dig out the truth. However, he still managed to collect some
students’ comments:

>
> 河北大学同学的声音之一，有同学给我的留言如下：“现在学校不让我们说这件事情，所以目击者很难找，因为他们一旦向记者透漏什么事情，学校知道后肯定会对说的学生做出处分的，谁都会害怕，所以学校里的目击者都只能什么也不说。”

Voices from Hebei University's student 1, “Now that the school does not allow
us to comment on the incident, it is very difficult to look for eyewitnesses.
Once they told the reporters what they have seen, the school will definitely
find out the informant and punish him/her. Everyone is scared, so they all
keep silent.”

> 河北大学同学的声音之二，同学给我留言：“我妈已严令禁止我再管这事，但我没办法让自己的良心受煎熬！晓凤惨白的脸一直在我眼前晃动，我若不管，我怕我会
> 夜夜被噩梦缠绕！晓凤晶晶都是我所在社团的部员，她们甜甜的叫过我学姐，我没法坐视不理！但，我真的没办法要求那些仅仅是目击人的同学太多”

Voices from Hebei University's student 2: “My mother has forbidden me to
follow the incident. But my conscience is giving me a hard time. The plain
face of Xiaofung keeps appearing in front of me. If I don't speak up, I will
be haunted. Xiaofung and JingJing are both members of my club, they have
called me big sister before, I can't just step aside. However, I cannot demand
too much from other eyewitnesses.”

> 河北大学同学的声音之三，同学留言说：“我觉得您根本不太清楚现在大学黑暗城什么样了，学校领导就像地方一霸，他们的一句话影响同学考研，入党，毕业，奖学金，答辩等几乎所有问题，有人说高考决定一生，其实大学的校领导更能决定一个人的一生吧。”

Vocies from Hebei University student 3: “You have no idea how corrupted the
university is nowadays. The school authority is like local triad. What they
said would affect students’ future – whether they can enter graduate school
and the party, whether they can get their graduate certificates, scholarships,
etc. People said the high school examination can determine a person's future,
but school leaders have even more power over students!”.
