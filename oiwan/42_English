An ongoing [strike by Hong Kong dock
workers](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-02/hongkong-intl-terminals-
faces-hk-5-million-daily-loss-on-strike.html) demanding a pay raise and
protesting arduous working conditions is delivering a costly blow to the
city's port operators and winning widespread support from the public.

A few hundred workers began to camp inside the docks on March 28, 2013 after
subcontractors for Hutchison International Terminals (HIT) which runs the
docks, rejected their demand for a [100 Hong Kong dollars [12.88 US dollars]
or 20 percent pay increase per eight-hour shift](http://www.inmediahk.net/97).
The subcontracting companies countered with an offer of 5 percent, far below
what workers expected. A survey among dock workers showed that they are
willing to settle with a [10
percent](http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130403/-2-2933637/1.html) [zh] rise.

The workers, some of whom work 24-hour shifts, said that they haven't received
raises since 2003 and their current salary is lower than what was paid in
1997.

A [judge has since rule](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-
kong/article/1205103/judge-orders-striking-workers-end-occupation-kwai-tsing-
dock) that the striking workers cannot enter the ship terminals; protests
continue on the street outside the entrance.

HIT, which made a [net profit of 2.2 billion HK
dollars](http://thehousenews.com/society/hit%E5%89%8D%E8%A8%80%E4%B8%8D%E5%B0%8D%E5%BE%8C%E8%AA%9E/)
[zh] [283 million US dollars] from its terminal operation business in 2012,
has [refused](http://www.inmediahk.net/hit8) [zh] to negotiate with the
workers, insisting that the workers are not their employees but employees of
the subcontracting companies. Those companies receive [a service
charge](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=525059287533176&set=a.448598068512632.101441.448585381847234&type=1&theater)
of 3.2 billion HK dollars [412 million US dollars] from HIT and spend only 710
million HK dollars [91 million US dollars] on dock workers.

According to HIT, the strike is costing the company [five million Hong Kong
dollars](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323296504578398082723513470.html)
[644,000 US dollars] a day.

Hong Kong is the third busiest container port in the world, growing more than
[50 percent between 2000 and
2012](http://www.pdc.gov.hk/chi/statistics/hongkong.htm). But the growth has
brought with it deteriorating working conditions because of what workers claim
is exploitation by subcontractors.

Below is a video by Yiuman Fung from inmediahk.net showing the strike on April
1, 2013:

The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) [explained the

between terminal operators, subcontractors and workers in an illustration,
maintaining that the terminal operators sole objective is to squeeze workers
and make a profit. In the illustration, subcontractors appear as executors:

Stories of worker mistreatment have circulated on social media and citizen
media, alerting the public to the miserable working conditions at the docks.

Since September 2012, dock workers started sharing their hardships on a
Facebook page dedicated to collecting their stories. On October 2, 2012, one

Student activist Willis Ho [described](http://www.inmediahk.net/hit2) [zh] on
inmediahk.net the working conditions of subcontracted dock workers and
explained why HIT, a company under [Hutchison Whampoa
Limited](http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/en/global/home.php), the largest
dock operator in the world, is the main target of the strike:

>
> 公司旗下有五間外判商，分別為現創、聯榮、高寶、永豐及培記，負責聘請碼頭內不同的工種，包括橋邊理貨員（俗稱揸紙）、繫絪員（俗稱水爺）、機手、掛釩員、內運車司機、驗櫃員等。工種主要分為公司工及外判工，公司工由香港碼頭公司直接聘用，直屬李嘉誠，在待遇上較合理和穩定，例如有輪班時間、按月出糧（普遍有十七個月糧）、有固定食飯時間、年尾花紅等。外判工則由外判公司招聘，有時再作二判、三判。工作時間由十六至二十四小時不等，按工出糧，每二十四小時一千一百一十五元，三更工資不一。福利上，外判工沒有規定的食飯時間、也沒有醫療保障和花紅。

> 試想像一個人連續工作二十四小時、在四號、六號、七號、八號泊位之間遊走，遊走整整，一晝一夜。事實上，貨櫃碼頭裡的揸紙和水爺，其實就是如此。他們要每月都連續工作廿四小時，做足三更。…在繁忙的船期，節日前後，外判商為了減少人手，碼頭工人不得不加班，「直踩」七十二小時。[…]現時揸紙和水爺工作一連三更，只得

The dock workers’ plight has won sympathy from members of the general public.

Supporters have uploaded their photos of support to Facebook.

Student volunteers have [collected
supplies](http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1016037) [zh] such as rain clothes,
sleeping bags, and bottled water for the striking workers. The Hong Kong
Confederation of Trade Unions has also set up a fund to support the striking
workers and has so far [collected 1.4
million](http://www.inmediahk.net/117-hit) HK dollars [180,328 US dollars].
