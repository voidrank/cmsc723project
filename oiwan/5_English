circulate on social media.

As stories of ill treatment and torture in China's [“re-education
camps”](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2167893/china-
legalises-use-re-education-camps-religious-extremists) in the western Xinjiang
province continue to circulate, Uyghur communities outside of China are
demanding that Beijing release information about their missing relatives and
friends.

The #MeTooUyghur social media campaign was prompted by the release of a video,
from Chinese authorities, in which prominent musician and camp detainee
Abdurihim Heyit told viewers that he had not been tortured to death in a
Xinjiang prison.

Rumors that Heyit had died were viral on various social media platforms on
February 8 and 9. Then on February 10, Turkey's Foreign Ministry issued a
strong statement criticizing China’s Xinjiang policy and calling for an end to
the re-education camps.

Spokesman Hami Aksoy [said:](https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/turkey-calls-on-
china-to-close-uighur-detention-camps-24016)

> Systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities towards Uighur Turks
> is a great embarrassment for humanity…It is no longer a secret that more
> than one million Uighur Turks, who are exposed to arbitrary arrests, are
> subjected to torture and political brainwashing in concentration centers and
> prisons.

Aksoy went on to assert that Hyeit had died:

> In such an environment, we’ve learned with great sorrow that dignified poet
> Abdurehim Heyit, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for his
> composition, died in the second year of his imprisonment.

Heyit is a master dutar player who he was sentenced to eight years in prison
for one of his songs.

The next day, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying released a
video to prove that Abdurehim Heyit is still alive. In the video, the Uyghur
poet said he had not been tortured and is in good health.

Hua called Turkey’s statement a “very big mistake” and said the reports about
Heyit’s death were an “absurd lie.” She said that Heyit was under
investigation on national security grounds.

The release of video has not quelled public tension around the treatment of
detainees. Uyghur communities from all over the world have begun using the
#MetooUyghur hashtag to urge the Chinese government to prove that their
missing friends and relatives are still alive in Xinjiang.

@HalmuratU, a Finland-based human rights activist whose father is missing in
Xinjiang, announced the campaign on Twitter:

The campaign has received a lot of attention and echoes. @TarimUyghur posted
photos of their father, mother, brothers and sisters on Twitter and asked
Beijing to show videos of them, to prove that they are still alive:

The Chinese government has taken notice of the campaign. Foreign ministry
spokeswoman Hua Chunying
[told](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/02/12/world/asia/ap-as-china-
turkey.html) reporters on February 12:

> China has more than 1 billion people, do we need to release a video of
> everyone?

@ferkat_jawdat, whose mother is still in a Xinjiang re-education camp,
repeated the call with a cheeky reference to the [massive surveillance
apparatus](https://www.businessinsider.com/xianjiang-province-china-police-
state-surveillance-2018-7) that China has deployed in Xinjiang:

> At a regular news briefing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman
