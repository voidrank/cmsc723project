On Friday, December 28, 2012, China's legislature, the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC),
[approved](http://english.sina.com/china/2012/1228/542944.html) a set of new
rules intended to tighten government control over the Internet. The new rules
will allow the State Council (China's central government) to amend the
[Administration of Internet Information Services
Procedures](http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/zcfg/201206/t1169111.htm) [zh], the
law governing the use of the Internet on Chinese territory, making it
compulsory for Internet Service providers (ISPs) and Online Service Providers
(OSPs)—like email, news or entertainment providers—to enforce real name
registration of internet users.

**Enforcing Internet Real Name Registration**

Among the 151 attendees of the NPC, 145 voted in favor of adopting the new
rules, 5 abstained and—in [a very rare show of
dissidence](http://blog.caijing.com.cn/expert_article-151263-45707.shtml)
[zh]—1 representative voted against. The most controversial part of the
[12-article document](http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2012-12-28/16107934045.shtml)
[zh] is the “Protection of Personal Information Online” section, which deals
with real name registration. The document reads:

> Network service providers will ask users to provide genuine identification
> information when signing agreements to grant them access to the Internet,
> fixed-line telephone or mobile devices or to allow users to post information
> publicly — [Xinhua](http://english.sina.com/china/2012/1228/542944.html)

The actual implementation of the real name provision will be specified in
practice by the central government in a future amendment of the Administration
of Internet Information Services Procedures, the law first introduced in 2000
and that governs Internet use in China.

The law already forces ISPs to ask users to register with their real names.
OSPs, like micro-blogging platforms, on the other hand, have so far only been
“encouraged” to ask all their users to register with their real names.

[Sina Weibo](http://weibo.com/) [zh], China's most popular and influential
microblogging service, has two real name registration systems. The first is a
verification system for celebrities, similar to that of Twitter. Upon
government pressure, Weibo launched a second real name registration mechanism
in early 2012 for its broader community of users. The system is connected to
Weibo's [online payment platform](https://pay.sina.com.cn/index) where
mainland Chinese users have to submit their real names, I.D. card numbers,
create a password for their online payment service. The system will then match
the user's name and I.D. card number to complete the verification process. As
for overseas users, real name registration is not required. Sina Weibo
encourages them, however, to connect their mobile phone numbers with their
accounts.

On February 2012, Sina Weibo threatened to suspend anonymous users’ accounts
if they failed to register their real names before March 16, 2012. Past the
deadline, anonymous users could no longer comment or retweet under certain
“hot-topics.” However, the policy was very short-lived. In fact it lasted only
for a few days as the company seen a steep drop in user activity, forcing it
to restore its original basic service.

Currently, anonymous users can still post micro-blogs, retweet and comment.
However, many still complain about strange system behavior: some say their
posts are visible only to themselves or to mutually followed friends, some
only to followers.

The future amendment may penalize those OSPs which fail to enforce real name
registration. The new set of regulations will also allow OSPs to change their
terms of service with their users without running the risk of being sued by
their clients.

**Implications of the New Set of Rules**

How the policy will actually be implemented is a matter for the State Council
to decide. That's why prominent human rights lawyer, Liu Xiaoyun, urged all
netizens to voice their opposition against any measure that could violate
freedom of expression as protected by the Chinese constitution. Below is the
translation of a selection of Liu's answers to a series of questions and
concerns raised by Chinese netizens on the [Netease microblog
[zh]](http://t.163.com/chat/wlxxbh?from=index) platform:
