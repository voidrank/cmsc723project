Beijing government has recently required all Internet service providers (ISPs)
and data centers to install a software called Blue Dam in all their servers.
According to today's [Taiwan Apple Daily
News](http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/31938140/IssueID/20090913),
the Blue Dam has to be activated by today (September 13) or the companies have
to subject to punishment.

The Blue Dam software can be downloaded from [here](http://bit.ly/34iYY). The
Blue Dam is developed by [Shanghai Andatong Information Safety Technology
Company ](http://www.adtsec.com/profile.asp) and ccording to [a report back in
July
2009](http://www.finet.hk/mainsite/newscenter_story.php?news=PRNEWSBJ&ncode=25823&page=),
the Blue Dam is 20 times more effective than the Green Dam as it is a
combination of software and hardware.

The Blue Dam system is consisted of the following features: a graphic-
filtering system, administrative-management system, internet-behavior manager,
VPN client. The developer said that the business version of the Blue Dam can
help company to stop their workers from visiting websites or hanging around in
the Internet on non work related activities.

Back in June, the Beijing government required international PC makers to
[equip their PC shipped to China with a filter software called “Green Dam-
Youth Escort”](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/08/china-green-
dam-pc-filtering) by July 1. The plan was finally dropped as the internet
public opinion has strong reaction against the filter.

Now that the Blue Dam is installed at the ISP level without much open
discussion. Netizens will be subject to censorship and online behavior control
with little self-awareness.
