Chomsky's support for the anti-media monopoly campaign in Taiwan has been
reported as being misled by activists. [Public domain photo]

The photo above, in which Noam Chomsky is holding a placard, is part of a
[global campaign](https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanWhatsNext?sk=photos)
organized by Taiwanese students against media monopoly in Taiwan. Chomsky's
photo has been circulated widely via online social media since early January
2013. However, a number of news outlets recently reported that he was misled
by Taiwanese anti-media monopoly activists into supporting the campaign. What
has exactly happened? Who misled Chomsky?

In the past few days, a number of mainstream media outlets run by the Want
Want China Times Group in Taiwan reported that Chomsky was misled by a young
Taiwanese female student, Lin Ting-An. Below is a list of translated
headlines:

1\. [Chomsky: If I knew the campaign is against China, I would not have held
the
placard](http://news.chinatimes.com/politics/50207531/112013020400077.html)

2\. [Anti-media monopoly became anti-China campaign, Chomsky was set
up](http://news.chinatimes.com/mainland/11050506/112013012900194.html) [zh] –

3\. [Misled to hold the placard, Chomsky: This is serious
distortion](http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/501012738/112013013000094.html)
[zh] – China Times 28-01-2013

In addition to the newspapers, the Citi TV channel, also controlled by Want
Want China, ran a [one-hour news commentary
program](http://blog.ctitv.com.tw/TWconsultant/archive/2013/01/30/0130mit.aspx)
on January 29 and 30, 2013 to “clarify” Chomsky's position. The program
accused Lin Ting-An, who invited Chomsky to hold the placard, of misleading
and using the famous linguist, “the conscience of the U.S”. The commentators
in the program also criticized the strategy of the media monopoly movement for
singling out pro-China capital, namely Want Want China Times, for its
campaign. Below is a short clip of a Citi TV interview with Chomsky:

The media reports were triggered by [email
communications](https://www.facebook.com/notes/shih-diing-liu/taiwan-must-be-

between Macau based media professor Shih-Diing Liu and Chomsky in which Liu
explained his understanding of the anti-media monopoly movement in Taiwan on
January 27 2013:

> However, I am unsure if you have realized that this anti-media monopoly
> movement, with its high level of participation among young people, cannot be
> understood as a simply a movement seeking freedom of the press and democracy
> on the island. The participants, speakers, and interveners (including the
> mainstream media, scholars, and groups who have followed along and
> appropriated the issue) not only focus on the issue of media resources being
> monopolized by capitalists but also point toward an enemy. This enemy
> happens to be the one that the government of your country has been
> cautiously dealing with. However, in the context of Taiwan and the Taiwan
> Strait, using the name of “defending Taiwan” to refuse, oppose, and reject
> all people and matters relating to China and the Chinese government is not
> an isolated phenomenon, and it needs to be placed in the hegemonic structure
> led by the United States that you have described so we can fully understand
> it. The slogan in your hands should also be interpreted in a specific
> political context.

In response to Liu's long email Chomsky wrote a brief reply which was quoted
and made public by Liu in his Facebook:

> Thanks for the interesting comments, which go far beyond anything I know
> about. I also don’t recall a placard referring to “Chinese manipulation.”
> What I was shown, and held, didn’t go beyond media monopoly and freedom of
> press. I hope that interpretations don’t go beyond that.

Attached to Chomsky's reply is Liu's rather lengthly interpretation which was
[picked up by China
Times](http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/501012738/112013013000094.html) on its
January 28 news report and turned into a news and commentary framework among
Want Want China Times’ media outlets for use against the anti-media monopoly
campaign. Liu interpreted Chomsky's photo as “abduction”:

>
> […]如果人家喬姆斯基並不知道此一訴求，你把人家“綁架”來舉個牌子迎合你自己的立場需求，是不是也太不尊重對方了？為什麽不充分告知人家你們真正的反對中國的立場呢？為什麼牌子上，只有”反對媒體壟斷”有英文翻譯呢？你反中國的立場大可以明白表示，讓對方清楚認知考慮後再表態，不需要遮遮掩掩。是否因為怕喬老要是知道了這個立場，未必會表態支持，索性就模糊其辭，就不得而知了。但如果喬老人家根本就不知道你運動所包括的反中訴求，就把人家趕鴨子上架，這樣的做法，未免也太缺乏政治技巧了吧！[…]

> 他所認定和支持的立場，針對的是反對媒體壟斷和媒體新聞自由。喬老並不希望外界的解讀，踰越這個範疇，或加油添醋。
> 問題是，台灣部分反中人士和媒體，卻綁架他來為自己的立場掩護。每個運動都有自己的立場訴求，但為自己的立場訴求辯護手段要經得起檢驗，要用道理說服人。

>
> 按此理解，如果喬姆斯基當時不是被誤導、被糊弄，就不知道怎麽回事了。那些要求他舉牌的，自己應當最清楚。人家顯然沒有被告知完整訊息，就被硬扯進來為你們自己的立場背書。你們這種暗渡陳倉、移花接木的做法，和你們口口聲聲所反對的言論壟斷和扭曲，有什麼兩樣？你們不就是打着”反壟斷”的正義旗幟，做相反的事嗎？

To clarify the situation, Lin Ting-An posted her [email communication to
Chomsky](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200581447765600&set=a.1203343450676.2032717.1441309367&type=1)
in her Facebook. The email, inviting Chomsky to join the campaign, explained
in detail the background of the campaign against Pro-China media group Want
Want China Times’ acquisition of Next Media, with the translation of the
placard slogans:

> Here is now a horrible media monopoly event happening in Taiwan: The Pro-
> China Want Want China Times Group chairman, Tsia Eng-meng, is going to buy
> the Taiwanese branch of Next Media (which was owned by Hong Kong mogul Jimmy
> Lai). If this purchase is approved, Mr. Tsai will control about 46% of
> Taiwan's newspaper market. Mr. Tsai not only owns the newspaper (China
> Times, Commercial Times), but also the magazine, TV channel, and cable TV
> service, and his turning a blind eye to Beijing's human rights violations
> (He denies the Tiananmen square massacre) make us become really worried
> about the future of Taiwanese media.
>
> In order to against this purchase and the government ignorance, Taiwanese
> students have launched several protests since November and will hold another
> one on New Year's Eve. There is now an activity which urges global
> supporters to photograph themselves, holding the slogan of “Oppose Media
> Monopoly, Reject the black hand of China, uphold freedom of the press, I
> protect Taiwan in ___”, and upload it online. (I attached my photo which
> took at Yang Ming university, Taiwan.)

Although Chomsky has further clarified that [he had not been misled by anyone
and the incident was a
“misunderstanding”](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/02/02/2003554016),
his statement has not had much bearing on the major media outlets.

The debate about whether or not the China Factor should be stressed in the
anti-media monopoly campaign has been a debate within the movement since day
one. On the one hand, activists are aware that the media liberalization policy
since the 1990s has been the driving force of the capital monopoly of Taiwan
mainstream media. On the other hand, the influence of mainland China capital,
as well as its political agenda to take control of Taiwanese media
corporations, has become more and more obvious in the Want Want China Times’
[acquisition of TV Cable
Network](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/04/taiwan-smear-campaign-
sparks-historic-media-monopoly-protest/) and [Taiwan Next
Media](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/10/15/taiwan-media-workers-act-to-
save-journalistic-autonomy/). Similar debates have been going on among
activists for months. After the Chomsky incident, in the anti-Want Want China
Times campaign page, Jiangeng Chiou [raised the
issue](https://www.facebook.com/idontwantwant/posts/480483298666233) [zh]
again:

For those who are outside Taiwan, it is very difficult to understand the
political dynamic and it seems rather inevitable that Chomsky be misled and
distorted in such a media and political environment.
