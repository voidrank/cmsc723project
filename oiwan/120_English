The Hong Kong government is encouraging family to have three babies, at the
same time, it is so keen on censoring away information concerning sex. Of
course sex is not all about giving birth, but how can we have babies without
sex? Guess the government will advocate test tube babies pretty soon.

The latest sex censorship is a case against posting a hyperlink to
pronographical photos in the adult section of a BBS forum. The court found the
defendant guilty under [COIAO (Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles
Ordinance) ](http://www.tela.gov.hk/english/COIAOScheme.htm)and sentenced to
$5000 fine.

[Charles Mok ](http://charlesmok.blogspot.com/2007/05/obscene-
hyperlink.html)is very worried about the the case:

When I read this report, my first reaction is “what the hell is this?!” When
does Hong Kong become mainland China? And, have I broken the law before? I
have posted much more “obscene” youtube links before!

Plastichk [finds the situation so
ridiculous:](http://plastichk.blogspot.com/2007/05/blog-post_11.html)

> 在「成人貼圖區」發佈成人照片，由發佈到觀看的，雙方都是成年人，…為何同一張相片，貼在美國的討論區則合法，放 server

In an “Adult photo sharing BBS” for posting photos, supposingly all are
adults… why for a same photo, when you post in a U.S BBS, it is legal, in a
Hong Kong server, it becomes illegal? even though viewers are all from Hong
Kong?) As for the police, how can they argue that such behaviour would affect
local security? do we have too many police here?…

In order to protest against this ridiculous and highly political case,[ I have
put a nude photo (link from flickr) and a hyperlink to a sex blog at
inmediahk.net](http://www.inmediahk.net/public/article?item_id=217645) to
invite criminal charge from Hong Kong government. I have also invited other
netizens to make it a collective legal action.

[Fred Lam has echoed my call](http://blog.lamfai.net/2007/05/google.html) and
posted all the links that he search from google under “sexy hot chick”.

> 如果貼超連結都有罪的話，請問為甚麼政府不起訴 Google，而起訴一個在成人貼圖區貼三級相片超連結的小網民？

If hyperlink is guilty, why doesn't the government prosecute google, but a
netizen who posted a hyperlink in an adult discussion group?

This is not a single case, because a few days ago, the Chinese University
Student Press is also under attack by the mainstream media because they have
opened some sex columns at the student magazine.

[![](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2007/05/head.jpg)](http://www.inmediahk.net/fs/29861%2f7head%2ejpg)

According to an insider story (via [inmediahk.net
[zh]](http://www.inmediahk.net/public/article?item_id=217009&group_id=11))
from the Student Press, the mainstream media got some complaint letters from
conservative religious groups, and within 12 hours, the story hit the headline
of major mainstream Chinese newspapers. And the university administration made
a statement that they would investigate the issue and consider to punish the
students who are in charge of the magazine.

The obscene article is a questionaire about sex, including sex fantasy. Among
the 14 sets of questions, two are about fantasy and attitude towards incest
and bestiality.

The case has raised concern from local homosexual and sex rights groups. As
[it is not the first time conservative religion
groups](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/01/24/hong-kong-impartial-
rule-or-discrimination/) make use of the censorship tool to silent sex talk.

As the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority will investigate the
case and decide whether the student magazine has also violated the[
COIAO](http://www.tela.gov.hk/english/COIAOScheme.htm), a signature campaign
has been launched at inmediahk.net [to plead for not
guilty](http://www.inmediahk.net/public/article?item_id=216934).

Meanwhile, the university disciplinary committee has issued a statement saying
that the student press “has passed the acceptable moral line” and will ban the
publication of the sex pages and consider punishing the editor in charge as
the publication has “affected the image of the university”. [Plato questions
whether the school administration
body](http://www.inmediahk.net/public/article?item_id=217342&group_id=11) has
the power to intervene into the student press’ editorial policy:

>
> 請中大校長、中大校務會學生紀律委員會不要受傳媒一面倒的批評所影響，請你們自行閱讀問卷的問題和內容，倘若問卷的問題及答案有直接宣揚某類性行為，請清楚指出，我相信編輯同學欠中大學生一個解釋，但倘若沒有，請中大校務會學生紀律委員會發表聲明向中大學生報編輯道歉，而本人閱讀問卷的問題和答案後，並不覺得它有宣揚某類性行為的跡象，相反它只交待不同人對某些我們在日常社交中不敢宣諸於口的性幻想、性行為和性經驗。

I wish that the Chinese University Principal and disciplinary committee could
read the questionaire by themselves and not be affected by the mainstream
biased report. If the questions and answers have advocated some sort of sexual
behaviour, please point it out and let the editors explain to the students. If
not, the disciplinary committee should apologize to the editors. I read the
questionaires and the answers, and did not find any advocacy of certain sexual
behaviour. On the other hand, it reports on certain sexual fantasies,
behaviours and experiences that exist among people but rarely discussed.

> 我不知道中大校務會學生紀律委員會是一個什麼單位，它是否有權要求中大學生報的編輯停止刊登情色版的內容呢？

I have no idea what kind of administrative unit the disciplinary committee
belongs to, whether it has the power to order the student press's editors not
to publish content related with sex.

Amnesty International (Hong Kong) has also issued a statement to the
University Administration. The organization expressed concern that [the
judgement of the discipinary committee will affect the freedom of speech and
press in Hong
Kong](http://www.inmediahk.net/public/article?item_id=217658&group_id=11).

However, [diumanpark criticises
](http://diumanpark.mysinablog.com/index.php?op=ViewArticle&articleId=569705)that
the editors are not critical but follow the market logic.

> 但係今日做學生就已經冇晒火，識睇住個市場，或者製造市場，先至係叻仔。我哋以前做學
> 生，尚有幾分熱血，對於坊間以新聞包裝嘅色情，會抗拒和批評，今日世界唔同，一份學生搞嘅風月版，不單贏盡報紙做嘅，就連色情雜誌都輸埋。

Today the students are without passion, they just concerned about the market
or making the market. When I were student, I were passionate and critical. I
would criticise obscenity in newspapers. Today the world is very different, a
student press has won over the newspapers and sex magazines.

Jim feels that the university students are just [reflection of the
society](http://mrjimtong.mysinablog.com/index.php?op=ViewArticle&articleId=567376),

> 眾所周知，香港教育制度落後，性教育不足，雖說是大學生，性知識仍相當貧乏，滿腦子只裝滿了由互聯網和風月刊物所提供的毒素。因此，到有機會自己辦報時，欲以學術方式談性，到頭來又不是亂倫、人獸交等話題？這究竟是大學生的錯，還是社會的錯？

The whole world know that Hong Kong is so backward in education, there is a
lack of sex education. Even for university students, their don't have enough
knowledge about sex, their brains are full of rubbish from internet and sex
magazine. When they have chance to publish their own magazine, they want to
explore the issue, however, in the end it is the same old topics about incest
and animal sex. The fault is on the university students or on the society?

I have also signed the statement against the charge of COIAO, not that I enjoy
reading the sex column in student magazine, but against the unreasonable
censorship practice in Hong Kong that would eventually ruin the society.
