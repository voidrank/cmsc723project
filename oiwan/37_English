The purge and [execution of Jang Song
Thaek](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2522859/Kim-Jong-Uns-uncle-
Jang-Song-Thaek-executed-North-Korea-traitor.html), uncle of North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un, has stunned the world, in particular its close neighbor
and ally China.

Jang, who was in charge of North Korea's economic reform, worked closely with
China fomenting economic cooperation between the two countries. In Jang's
indictment, one of the accusations he faced was that he sold off the country's
precious resources for cheap.

While the Chinese Foreign Ministry calmly claimed that [Jang's execution was
“an internal affair” for North
Korea](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/12/16/kore-d16.html), Chinese
netizens were outraged and took the change to reflect upon the inhumane nature
of dictatorship.

On Twitter-likewebsite Sina Weibo, Lian Pang, a columnist and writer,
[criticized](http://weibo.com/1641428154/An8PdAcEz) the Foreign Ministry's
lack of backbone:

>
> 张成泽被枪毙了，某国外交部发言人说“这是朝鲜的内部事务”。好吧，那发展核武器算不算内部事务？朝鲜发生这样残酷的人道灾难，国际社会其他成员都负有道义责任。[…]如此表态只会给外界一种站在邪恶一边的观感。

> Jang Song Thaek was executed and some country's foreign spokesperson said,

> Is that internal? What is happening in North Korea is a human disaster and

Xia Shang, a Chinese novelist,
[extended](http://weibo.com/1497878455/AntnRtMTX) the criticism towards the
dictatorship system:

>
> 三胖杀姑父根本不是国家事件，而是打着党名义的金家私事。张成泽作为独裁政权的捍卫者和帮凶，也不过是入瓮之君，死得其所。专制的游戏规则就是没有规则，一切均以一党一己之私利为纲。也别嘲笑白头山血统的说辞，井冈山血统依然伟大光荣正确。

Xia Shang's subtle criticism of the Chinese Communist Party's dictatorship has
resonated with many web users. Below is a selection of netizens’ comments
[translated by ](http://www.chinasmack.com/2013/stories/kim-jong-uns-uncle-

In fact, the execution of Jang has reminded many netizens of the great purge
during the [Chinese Cultural
Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution). Anonymous Weibo
user “Reincarnation-back-to-world” [drew the
connection](http://weibo.com/3129955773/Anwuk5EMC) explicitly:

>
> 朝鲜对张成泽反革命集团进行大清洗，是当年文革的翻版；当年文革中，灭老刘、杀贺龙、整老彭、戮林彪，挑动全国武斗；也是当年苏联大清洗的翻版；斯大林杀害苏联高级军官老百姓上千万！清洗、镇压、独裁分子都这么干！
