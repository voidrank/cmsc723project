On August 19, Twitter [
revealed](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong.html)
that 936 accounts originating from mainland China were ”attempting to sowing
political discord” in Hong Kong so as to ”undermine the legitimacy and
political positions” of the anti-extradition movement on the ground.

Upon investigations, Twitter believed that the information operation was
state-backed in a coordinated manner.

Although Twitter is blocked in China since 2009, some of the above accounts
had accessed Twitter from specific unblocked IP addresses originating in
mainland China, the company explained. Moreover, the 936 accounts were merely
the most active ones and there existed a larger network of approximately
200,000 accounts created as part of this operation. The company said that it
suspended all of the accounts for a number of violations of its ”platform
manipulations policies”, including spam, coordinated activity, fake accounts,
attributed activity and ban evasion.

Although Twitter stated that the company was ”committed to understanding and
combating how bad-faith actors use [their] services”, a simple search could
still bring the audience to a huge number of disinformation about the protests
in Hong Kong on the platform.

### **Coordinated information operations**

One coordinated spread of disinformation was about the protest crackdown on
August 11. Several state-run news outlets including [China
Daily](https://www.weibo.com/1663072851/I1MkbtA99) reported that one protester
was using US-made M320 grenade launcher to attack the police.

> 2019](https://twitter.com/ChinaDaily/status/1160559229452705792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The fact is there has not been any evidence that the “gun” appearing in the
video was in fact M320 or just imitation firearm for war game and there has
not been any police officer reportedly being hurt by M320 or other types of
firearms.

At the same time, [China Central
Television](https://twitter.com/roseluqiu/status/1160795730728095748/photo/1)
alleged the woman whose right eye was badly injured after Hong Kong police
fired a round of bean bags outside Tsim Sha Tsui police station was actually
injured by other protesters. The report also suggested that the woman was a
middle person paying young people to join the protests by posting a photo in
which she was handing money to another person.

The fact is Hong Kong police admitted that they had fired [a maximum of 10
rounds of bean
bags](https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%84%E7%88%86%E7%9C%BC%E7%90%83-%E8%AD%A6%E5%B1%95%E9%96%8B%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%A5%E6%8C%87%E7%99%BC%E5%B0%84%E5%B8%83%E8%A2%8B%E5%BD%88%E6%95%B8%E7%82%BA-%E5%8D%81%E6%A7%8D%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8B/)
outside Tsim Sha Tsui police station near the woman got shot. The woman is a
first aiders as identified by others in the medical team.

Today, when Global Voices searched for terms and expressions like “stupid
fellow protester” (猪队友) in Chinese, “M320 Hong Kong” on Twitter, generated
results still included a considerable amount of fake news depicting Hong Kong
protests as terrorist activities. Below is a typical example of a tweet
disseminating the two fake news stories mentioned above:

>
> 笑屎人了，自己被猪队友射中还甩锅给警察，天大的笑话，布袋弹穿透力会拐弯?穿透力这么强?打穿广告牌后还精准射中那个有眼店铺看不清现实的港独暴徒?，你们所做的事都是危害社会的，打着和平示威的口号，袭击香港警察，镭射笔，砖头，雨伞，燃烧弹甚至连外国的M320榴弹发射器都使用，你们就是恐怖分子

After the August 11 brutal crackdown on the protests, the Chinese government
stated in a press conference that Hong Kong protests had shown [signs of
terrorism](https://globalvoices.org/2019/08/14/beijing-says-hong-kong-anti-
extradition-protests-show-signs-of-terrorism/) on the next day. However, the
claim about “signs of terrorism” is not grounded but built upon massive amount
of fake and distorted information spread on social media inside and outside
mainland China.

### **Beyond Twitter: Spamming, harassment and more**

Twitter is just one of the battle sites outside China, Instagram and Facebook,
also blocked in the country, faced similar information operations.

Facebook [said](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/20/china-backing-online-
campaign-hong-kong-protests-twitter-facebook-say/) that it identified
“deceptive tactics” deployed by accounts associated with the Chinese
government. The company had only removed seven pages, three groups and five
accounts originating from mainland China used to manipulate information
related to Hong Kong.

China online patriotic trolls had launched several crusades to overseas sites,
in particular Facebook to pick fight with other users. The latest was [from
August 17 to
18](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QWLvmYYGC15c6P7JxEiPVw?fbclid=IwAR1WTsOSQBR4JWrUDa8M5BvL0UmhnMmO85oqo5F9UP3hPrp2qcVmttDxDjo),
when more than 10 thousand mainland Chinese online patriots had taken part in
the crusades. On Facebook, they spammed comments of independent and citizen
news outlets with Chinese flags and slogans to support the Hong Kong police.
Apple Daily News has to close the comment function in its live-streaming of
the protests on Facebook.

Hong Kong media outlets’ Facebook pages were spammed with Chinese flags posted
by patriotic trolls. Screen capture via China Daily's WeChat

They also filed massive reports to social media platforms such as Youtube and
Instagram demanding removal of images citing reasons such as “explicit
content”, “copyright”, “discrimination”, “defamation” and etc.

What’s worse, many supporters of Hong Kong protests were harassed through
social media platforms’ direct messaging functions. C.A Yeung posted one
example and asked Twitter to act upon it.

> Nothing. Reports of harassment are ignored. <https://t.co/KjK0JIhWrh>

It is a good news that Twitter has taken the first step to share their
investigation on information operation, but global platforms are yet to take
more proactive counter measures to stop state-sponsored information operations
and the bullying of internet users.
