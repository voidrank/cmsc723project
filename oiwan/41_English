The week-long National Day holiday has again brought chaos in major tourist
areas due to under-capacity – news and images about trapped tourists, and
dirty tourist spots full of trash have spread across micro-blogs. The
situation is frustrating and some suggest that it is about time to review the
Golden Week Holiday policy.

[Golden Week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_\(China\)) is a term
used in mainland China to describe the 7-day national holiday during Lunar New
Year in February and National Day in October. The policy was introduced back
in 1999 to promote domestic tourism and consumption. This year, because of the
Mid-Autumn Festival, the National Day Golden Week started earlier and within
the first three days, the whole country was full of chaos.

blog:

The chaos in Mount Hua has become the
[news](http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2012-10-03/082425296699.shtml) [zh] headline
in local media outlets. Up to 10 thousand tourists were trapped on top of the
mount with no shelter and food in cold and rain, while the mountain cable car
could not cater for the needs of so many tourists. On the other hand, the
hostels raised the rental price per bed to 1000 yuan [approximately USD120]
per night. Beijing micro-blogger Yuanyuan who was in Mount Hua yesterday
[described](http://www.weibo.com/1836064757/yEAUqnXED) [zh] the situation:

> 华山出事了~封山不售票了，特警进山了~所有来华山的公共交通都被中断了，铁路也被断了~山上好多被困的人，下山的旅游公交枢纽不堪重负也处于瘫痪状态，并且伴有民众暴乱的迹象~上、下山的路全部水泄不通~拥挤、谩骂、打架的，随处可见，真心害怕了，我想回家

This morning three boats near Gulang Island suddenly caught [on
fire](http://weibo.com/1314608344/yEHgwiR6l) [zh]. The accident may also be
related to the limited-capacity problem as Xiamen Wang Shuo
[described](http://www.weibo.com/1058296785/yExEC1ZTK) the situation:

In Sanya beach, after the mid autumn festival [50 tons of
trash](http://news.163.com/photoview/00AN0001/27949.html) was spread across a
3 km coastline.

Addressing the limited-capacity problem of tourist facilities, a Qinghua
scholar Cai Jiming
[suggested](http://news.sina.com.cn/c/sd/2012-10-03/000425295427.shtml)
abolishing the Golden Week Policy and replacing it with annual holidays so as
to allow employees to choose when exactly to take their paid leave. But it
seems that ordinary people [don't
understand](http://www.weibo.com/shmorningpost) his proposal and think that
the annual leave system will cut short their paid holiday.
