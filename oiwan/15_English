_[Update August 22, 2017: CUP has[reversed its
decision](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40998129) and unblocked the banned
articles in China.]_

[Cambridge University Press](http://www.cambridge.org/) (CUP) has removed more
than 300 academic articles (which were published in the academic journal [The
China Quarterly](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly))
from its website in China, in order to avoid a full shutdown.

In a statement, CUP [explained the
pressure](https://twitter.com/CambridgeUP/status/898517586308210688) that they
received from China:

> We can confirm that we received an instruction from a Chinese import agency
> to block individuals articles from China Quarterly within China. We complied
> with this initial request to remove individual articles, to ensure that
> other academic and educational materials we publish remain available to
> researchers and educators in this market.
>
> We are aware that other publishers have had entire collections of content
> blocked in China until they have enabled the import agencies to block access
> to individual articles. We do not, and will not, proactively censor our
> content and will only consider blocking individual items (when requested to
> do so) when the wider availability of content is at risk.

CUP said it would find a long-term solution to the censorship problem, and has
planned meetings to discuss its position with import agencies at the upcoming
[Beijing International Book Fair](http://www.bibf.net/en/).

### Criticism of CUP's approach

However, Greg Distelhorst, a [Massachusetts Institute of
Technology](http://web.mit.edu/) (MIT) professor, is critical of CUP's
strategy. He [left his
comments](https://twitter.com/CambridgeUP/status/898517586308210688) under the
publisher's statement:

> When a government or party curates your historical record, it uses your
> reputation to rewrite history.
>
> Students in China will read the ‘leading scholarly journal’ on China and
> conclude those political taboos can't be that important.
>
> ‘If Tiananmen was really important, wouldn't there be some serious analysis
> by top international scholars? Guess it was just fake news.’
>
> Your academic readers may be aware of the censorship, but this isn't much
> better.
>
> When a journal silences accurate scholarship for market access, it either
> means that core principles are up for negotiation…or the commitment to
> academic freedom was not authentic in the first place.

Award-winning journalist and author of [The People’s Republic of Amnesia:
Tiananmen
Revisited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Republic_of_Amnesia:_Tiananmen_Revisited),
Louisa Lim, is also critical of CUP's market concern:

> This is appalling. A clear example of the profit motive being valued over
> academic freedom, and by an academic publisher as well

### Shock over censorship

The China Quarterly is an interdisciplinary journal covering all aspects of
contemporary China, including Taiwan. The
[list](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-file-
manager/file/59970028145fd05f66868bf5) of censored pieces deals with
contemporary history and politics in China, including studies on the
[Tiananmen Square Massacre](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-tiananmen-square-
massacre-195216), the [Cultural
Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), the [Practice
of Rule of Law](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/20/what-does-china-mean-by-
rule-of-law/), political development since [Deng
Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping)‘s reform, the country's
[political model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_China),
[tension](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/chinas-financial-
system-tension-between-state-market) between state and market,
[Maoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism) and
[Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) ideology, [Falun
Gong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong), [labour rights
movements](http://www.dw.com/en/labor-rights-movements-gaining-momentum-in-
china/a-18959557), and studies about [Hong
Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong),
[Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan),
[Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet) and
[Xinjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang).

The journal's editor, Tim Pringle, expressed disappointment over the
censorship request in a [public
statement](https://twitter.com/chinaquarterly/status/898551786717491201):

> The China Quarterly wishes to express its deep concern and disappointment
> that over 300 articles and reviews published in the journal have been
> censored by the Chinese import agencies CEPIEC [China Educational
> Publications Import & Export Corporation Ltd.] and CNPIEC [China National
> Publications Import & Export (Group) Corporation]. We note too that this
> restriction of academic freedom is not an isolated move but an extension of
> policies that have narrowed the space for public engagement and discussion
> across Chinese society.

[CEPIEC](http://www.cepiec.com.cn/EN/) is the largest state-owned publication
import and export enterprise in China, established in 1987 by the Ministry of
Education to meet the demands of foreign academic publications from
universities and colleges in China.
[CNPIEC](http://group.cnpeak.com/h/en/ComJianJie1/) is another large, state-
owned cultural enterprise, which was founded in 1949.

Many concerned scholars have spoken out against CUP's censorship. Sam Crane, a
teacher of Chinese politics, urged CUP to give up its China-based site:

> Why do the Party's work? If this is what they demand, CUP should give up its
> China- based site and carry on elsewhere. <https://t.co/dgnszzPXQa>

[Anna L. Ahlers](http://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/people/aca/annalah/),
[Mette Halskov Hansen](http://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/people/aca/mettehh/)
and [Rune Svarverud](http://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/people/aca/runesva/),
who are former — and forthcoming — authors in The China Quarterly, [wrote a
note](https://twitter.com/AnnaLiAhlers/status/898570673202876416) via Twitter
to Cambridge University Press and China Quarterly, saying that they were
shocked by the decision:

> There is no compromise to the idea of a global system of science. Either the
> PRC [People's Republic of China] takes part in it or not: that is a decision
> that has to be taken in China, not in Europe/outside. We sincerely hope that
> the editors of The China Quarterly will react strongly against the move by
> CUP on behalf of all its dedicated authors and readers. Hopefully CUP will
> reverse its policy and insist on academic freedom even if Chinese
> authorities do not.

Greg Distelhorst elaborated his view in [an open
letter](https://twitter.com/gregdistelhorst/status/898586072346615808) to CUP,
which was co-signed by Jessica Chen Weiss, an associate professor at [Cornell
University](https://www.cornell.edu/):

> Chinese students and scholars reading a censored version of The China
> Quarterly will encounter only historical facts and scholarly analyses
> approved by political authorities. Worse Chinese readers will learn this
> sanitized history directly from the official website of Cambridge University
> Press.
>
> This censored history of China will literal bear the seal of Cambridge
> University.
>
> Scholarship does not exist to give comfort to the powerful. Nor is its
> purpose to find and exploit the largest market.

Christopher Balding, associate professor at [HSBC Business
School](http://english.phbs.pku.edu.cn/) in Shenzhen, launched [a
petition](https://www.change.org/p/christopher-balding-petition-cambridge-
university-press-not-to-censor-china-articles) demanding that CUP refuse the
censorship request made by the Chinese government.

### Fallout from China's ideological struggle

The pressure faced by CUP and other foreign publishers is the ripple effect of
China's internal ideological struggle, which previously mainly targeted
Chinese publications.

China has viewed university education as one of the most important ideological
battlefields since 2013, when university professors were
[instructed](https://globalvoices.org/2013/05/16/chinese-government-bans-
seven-speak-not-school-subjects/) by the Central Committee General Office of
the Chinese Communist Party not to teach seven subjects — including freedom of
the press, past mistakes of the Communist Party, and citizen rights.

In 2015, mainland Chinese universities were ordered to [ban
textbooks](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1695524/chinese-
universities-instructed-ban-textbooks-promote-western-values) that promote
Western values. Recently, a professor from [Beijing Normal
University](http://english.bnu.edu.cn/), Shi Jiepeng, was
[sacked](http://insidebusinessonline.com/index.php/2017/08/04/china-sacks-
professor-says-mao-zedong-devil/) for calling former leader Mao Zedong “a
devil” on social media.

The censorship practice has already affected Chinese academic publications —
in Hong Kong, for instance, even philosophy book projects are censored.
Baptist University’s Director of Liberal and Cultural Studies, [Dr. Wong Kwok
Kui](http://hum.hkbu.edu.hk/staff.php?staff_class=ts&staff_id=5), recently
revealed that two censorship requests were made by a publisher with a mainland
Chinese background. One incident happened in 2016, as [reported by Hong Kong
Free Press](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/08/08/academic-hits-commercial-
press-preface-hong-kongs-political-decay-removed-book/) (HKFP):

> Last year, when compiling an anthology on Nietzsche conferences, Wong said
> he was asked by the publisher to request that a writer amend an essay which
> criticised Xi Jinping as well as China’s policy towards Hong Kong and
> Taiwan. Wong refused, and the project was cancelled, despite everything
> being ready for publication.
