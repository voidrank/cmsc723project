The Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece, Global Times, published an editorial
on Christmas Eve [inviting international China observers to spend their
holiday in China](http://comments.caijing.com.cn/2012-12-24/112386059.html)
[zh] to witness how Chinese people celebrate Christmas all over the country.

This editorial was in response to the mounting criticism that China does not
have religious freedom. According to [China Aid's
report](http://www.chinaaid.org/2012/02/chinaaid-releases-annual-report-
of.html), at least 1289 arrests by Chinese authorities in 2011 were linked to
religious prosecution.

Despite the bold Global Times editorial, netizens reported that the entrances
of a few churches were blocked during Christmas this year. Moreover, China's
minority Muslim [Uyghur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people)
community, appalled by the editorial, dared the Global Times to invite
observers to the [Xinjiang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang) region for
their Muslim festival.

**Consumption freedom is not religious freedom**

Most netizens immediately pointed out the fallacy of the Global Times’
editorial in reducing religious freedom to secular Christmas celebration.

**House Churches are “evil cults”**

In China, all Protestant activities have to be under the coordination of [the
Three-self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in
China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Self_Patriotic_Movement), which is
under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Other Christian
sects, in the form of [House
Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_church_\(China\)), are considered
illegal and vulnerable to crack down. People outside the Christian circle tend
to believe that religious activities outside the Three-self Churches are evil
cults. Opinions like the following one coming from [ 詹姆-兰尼斯特
](http://weibo.com/2253221672/zbrF7iCuh) [zh] unfortunately are not uncommon:

>
> 这条新闻我真心不是很相信，教堂都是教产，而且国内都是三自爱的教产，政府自己封自己？被封的是家庭教会的可能性极大——如果真的是家庭教会，我预先说一句去你麻痹的臭邪教！

**Invite observers to Muslim festivals**

The Uyghur community in China also finds Global Times's editorial problematic.
Ulghurbiz.net wrote a commentary
[challenging](http://www.uighurbiz.net/archives/6726) Global Times and
inviting observers to Xinjiang for Muslim celebration:

>
> 《环球时报》的这篇评论漏洞百出，它把中国年轻人“过洋节”的消费文化移花接木地理解成了基督教文化在中国的自由发展。如果不是节日效应刺激效应，官方还会这么网开一面吗？另外，基督徒人数增加的首要原因是人们对国家核心价值观的失望之后转投宗教的怀抱以此寻求安慰呢，还是确如文章所说的是中国政府的开明政策呢？这需要系统的论证。

> 如果在开斋节或宰牲节等穆斯林传统节日来临之际，西方媒体指责中国政府压制穆斯林的宗教自由时，《环球时报》是否还敢发布一篇题为《怀疑宗教自由请来疆过节》的文章呢？
