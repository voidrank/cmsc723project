On March 21, 2018, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau announced a new policy
banning dual citizenship.

The Shanghai Permanent Residency Management Rule, which requires mainland
Chinese who acquired foreign nationality or took up residence in other
countries to either cancel their resident registration or face the
consequences of the [hukou
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system), which becomes effective
on May 1, 2018.

The hukou, or household registration system, goes hand in hand with certain
rights, especially for residents of big cities, who can enjoy freedoms like
electing their district representative, holding a bank account, purchasing
local property at a lower rate, and accessing education and retirement
pension. Many mainland Chinese who have bought property and migrated to other
countries have not cancelled their hukou.

While the parameters of the policy are not yet clear, it appears that for
those who fail to cancel their hukou, power reverts to the police, who would
do a mandatory cancellation.

According to the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times, [the new
rule](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1094613.shtml) is to assist
government’s [anti-graft campaign](https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/chinas-
anti-graft-campaign-527000-people-punished-in-2017/) as it would create
another barrier blocking corrupt officials from leaving China.

But, as @FightEagle2017 pointed out on Twitter, the policy implication is a
big deal for overseas Chinese:

>
> 【强制注销中国户籍】最近上海率先执行对侨居海外的侨民实行取消户籍的强制措施，全国也将迅疾跟进。这个人群大多在国内有房产、存款。多以中国身份证为留底凭证。户籍注销、身份证就废了。拿外国护照或绿卡去办房产或存款手续时，都将处处碰壁被刁难。一个没有户口的房子该如何合法保留？

People have been sharing their [diverse
opinions](https://www.weibo.com/1644114654/G8YuusLbY) on Weibo, one of the
most popular social media platforms in China. For those who support the
policy, they regard dual citizenship as the equivalent of wanting to have your
cake and eat it too:

> 都出国定居了，还不注销原所在地户口，这跟一个人有两个不同地址的身份证有什么分别？？什么人能有这样的特权？为什么给他们这样的特权？

> You have left the country and settled down in other countries, but you
> refuse to cancel your household registration. This is like carrying two ID

>
> 没错，国外定居生活是没占据资源，但是你也没创造财富！吃喝拉撒全在国外，连一个子儿的税都收不了你的，参与的是别人国家的建设，并没有和大家一起同甘共苦，又凭什么要求保留国籍把坑占住？为的是骑墙两头押宝两头占好处吗，想的还真是周到。这对于忠诚于这片土地上的其他人来说简直是天大的不公平！

Those against the policy, meanwhile, are pointing out the difference between
citizenship and nationality:

> 自己没能力出国居住的，请不要嘲笑别人。华人华侨很多是“身在国外心在汉”，很多也是在为国家做贡献，户口没了让人心寒吧。

> Please don’t laugh at those who have the ability to settle outside China.
> Many overseas Chinese are still loyal to China and want to contribute to the
> country. The cancellation of hukou will chill their hearts.

> 出国定居拿绿卡又不是加入外国国籍了，只是一个长期居留签证而已。就好比我现在深圳住，拿了深圳居住证，那我老家能因此注销我户口吗？

> Taking up residence outside China and getting a green card don't mean that I
> have changed my nationality. [The green card] is just a resident visa. It is
> similar to the resident document issued in Shenzhen; they cannot cancel my
> household registration back in my hometown.

> 出国的原因很多，有的也是为了谋生，就象从乡下到城里打工一样，最后要回国的，而且在国内还有资产，取消户籍没道理。当然加入外国国籍的取消户籍是合理的。

> There are many reasons for leaving the country. Similar to rural peasants

The news has shaken overseas mainland Chinese communities, as the cancellation
of hukou may imply that they might not be able to receive their retirement
pension or sell properties they own. Many are also concerned that other big
cities will follow in Shanghai's footsteps and ban dual citizenship.

Amidst this panic, the Shanghai public security department [explained
that](”https://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404221417636921231”) the
details of the policy have not yet been decided upon, since the authority is
yet to provide a clear definition of what “taking residence in other
countries” means. At this stage, those who live overseas but have not changed
their nationality or acquired dual citizenship, appear to be exempt.

Still, the clarification is too vague and has failed to address people’s
concerns. @dd201704 mocked the tone of the policy change:

> 上海房价要跌了伐？  
> 注销户口的闹剧一发布，因引起广泛华侨强烈反弹，政策又缩回去了…虚惊一场？  
>
> 政策说变就变，今天露个头，一看民众一片哗然，说收就收，将来呢😂？谁还敢把自家的财产放中国啊？我身边多位朋友都表示要马上卖了上海的房产，取光银行里的钱…说不定哪天再来一次打土豪分田地呢？跌📉

There is also much speculation over the rationale behind the policy:

>
> "出国定居将被注销户口"规定，虽打击了那些国内外两头通吃之人，但其真正用意恐是增加那些“全家移民并将资产移出中国“的难度。今后你若全家移民，难度很大，你须首先完成户口和身份证注销，那你名下房产和银行存款怎么办？只能暂时过户到亲戚名下，这会给你带来风险。以后全家移民只能一个接着一个来。

> 注销户口的原因是国内经济不行了，停发出国人员退休金。上海的出国人员退休金是个天文数字，很多人特地办早退后才出国，停发可省很多钱，欧美成熟社保体系下，出国人员每年离境半年以上，取消各种福利，回国定居一段时间后恢复，莫非中国也要如此？此做法是正确的，既然人不在该国，就无义务对其保障
