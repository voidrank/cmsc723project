Tens of thousands of people braved torrential rain in Hong Kong's Victoria
Park to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the [Tiananmen Square
massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989) with
a [candlelight
vigil](http://www.alliance.org.hk/english/News_and_events/candlelight_vigil.html).

The annual vigil remembers the Chinese government's brutal and bloody
crackdown on nearly two months of student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989. Soldiers clearing the square
at the time shot and killed hundreds of Chinese on June 4, 1989.

The Tiananmen Square protests remain a [taboo
subject](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/world/asia/thousands-rally-in-hong-
kong-on-tiananmen-square-anniversary.html?_r=0) in mainland China, and the
government's Internet censors routinely remove references to the movement
online.

Between 54,000 and [150,000 people](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-
kong/article/1253450/heavy-rain-halts-june-4-candlelight-vigil-hong-kongs-
victoria-park) turned out for this year's vigil, hosted by the [Hong Kong
Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic
Movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Alliance_in_Support_of_Patriotic_Democratic_Movements_in_China),
an advocacy group that promotes a democratic China which has organized the
event since 1990.

But the lead-up to the commemoration was [shadowed by a debate about its
theme](http://badcanto.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/the-founder-of-tiananmen-
mothers-was-asked-to-attack-hong-kong-localists/) “Love the country. Love the
people. Hong Kong Spirit”, seen by some as too pro-Chinese nationalism. Some
Hong Kong “localists”, who believe that Hong Kong should cut political ties
with mainland China in order to preserve its own autonomy, even advocated for
a boycott of the vigil, prompting the alliance to withdraw the slogan.

The move led to another round of criticism. For example, user “Wing” [wrote on
inmediahk.net, a citizen media platform
that](http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1016811) [zh] the denial of “patriotic
expression” on June 4th is a betrayal of the Hong Kong people's collective
experience in struggling against the one party regime of mainland China.

Regardless, many were left feeling hopeful after the vigil. Fung Ka Keung, a
volunteer for the event,
[wrote](https://www.facebook.com/fungkakeung/posts/10151237846133078) [zh] on
his Facebook page about what he witnessed:

> 今天一直在維園噴水池入口，市民從走行人路，到警察間歇封馬路市民走馬路，到警察全面封馬路。所有足球場爆滿，我再一次親眼目睹了。
>
>
> 下起大雨，大家全身濕透，見到有人避雨從糖街出口離開會場。但過了半小時，市民由離場多再一次變成進場多。足球場再次爆滿，警察跑來要求我們不要再叫人去足球場而改去草地。接著，告士打道就塞滿了去草地的人群，而且，他們縱使知道大會音響因惡劣天氣故障，仍然耐心等候，沒有半分投訴。
>
> 今天是感動的一天，最振奮人心的一天。縱使遇到巨大的挑戰，香港人仍然沒有離棄六四死難者，證明了香港人的良心不滅。

> Today, I was standing near the fountain entrance. At first people were
> walking into the park on the sideway and the police had to block the car way
> occasionally to let people passed. So many people kept coming and the police
> had to block the road next to the park. All the football fields were filled
> with people. I witnessed this again.
>
> Suddenly, the heavy rain started and people were soaked. Some people left
> the park from Sugar Street to seek refuge from the rain. However, in about
> half an hour, people returned to the park and the football fields were once

>
> This was a most touching and exciting day. Although we are facing such a big

[zh], the “Flower of Freedom”, which could be heard in almost every corner of
the park:

> 但有一個夢，不會死，記著吧！無論雨怎麼打，自由仍是會開花，但有一個夢，不會死，記著吧！來自你我的心，記著吧！

But I have a dream that will never die, please remember! No matter how the
rain falls on us, freedom will bloom. But I have a dream that will never die,
please remember! It comes from the heart of you and me, please remember!

soon after he returned home and made a date with his friends to return the
same day next year:

> 今年的六四晚會，很特別。 […]
> 相信在場人士也不會忘記那場雨。「無論雨怎麼打，自由仍是會開花」這一句唱得特別投入﹑特別激昂﹑特別應景。因為我們都明白「遇強愈強」的道理：只要我們仍堅信自己的信念，知道要捍衛真相，無論天氣如何惡劣﹑政治的局面如何險要也好，在這段路上也不應動搖。可能我只懂唸口號，唱歌還要看著歌詞。但我仍然堅持唸著守候著，是因為我知道在二十四年前，有一群與我年紀相約的學生，勇於的站出來。我做的雖然微不足道，但我仍希望由衷地表達心中的敬意和謝意。即使我不是在二十四年前的現場，但面對對今天道德﹑是非顛倒的社會，我只想以一點燭光表達不平則鳴。即使我不是在二十四年前的現場，但我也明白到作為父母親看著坦克下的孩子，那種無奈﹑心痛的感覺。雖然事隔廿四年，但感受仍是這樣的接近。[…]
> 明年今天，再次約會。

> The June 4 vigil this year is very special. […] For those who were there,
