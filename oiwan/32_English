> 《谶言一种》  
>  “A Kind of Prophecy”
>
> 村里的老人都说  
>  Village elders say
>
> 我跟我爷爷年轻时很像  
>  I resemble my grandfather in his youth
>
> 刚开始我不以为然  
>  I didn’t recognize it
>
> 后来经他们一再提起  
>  But listening to them time and again
>
> 我就深信不疑了  
>  Won me over
>
> 我跟我爷爷  
>  My grandfather and I share
>
> 不仅外貌越看越像  
>  Facial expressions
>
> 就连脾性和爱好  
>  Temperaments, hobbies
>
> 也像同一个娘胎里出来的  
>  Almost as if we came from the same womb
>
> 比如我爷爷外号竹竿  
>  They nicknamed him “bamboo pole”
>
> 我外号衣架  
>  And me, “clothes hanger”
>
> 我爷爷经常忍气吞声  
>  He often swallowed his feelings
>
> 我经常唯唯诺诺  
>  I'm often obsequious
>
> 我爷爷喜欢猜谜  
>  He liked guessing riddles
>
> 我喜欢预言  
>  I like premonitions
>
> 1943年秋，鬼子进  
>  In the autumn of 1943, the Japanese devils invaded
>
> 我爷爷被活活烧死  
>  and burned my grandfather alive
>
> 享年23岁  
>  at the age of 23.
>
> 我今年23岁  
>  This year I turn 23.
