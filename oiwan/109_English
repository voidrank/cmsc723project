Although [ Bullog.cn, one of the most influential independent blog hosting
platform in China, has been shut down under the pretext of internet cleaning
of smut](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/10/china-antismut-campaign-
sweeps-internet-but-any-untold-purpose), a number of prominent bloggers
declared that they would continue to speak. A few days ago,
[Sohu](http://www.sohu.com), a commercial blog hosting company, hosted a
blogger dinner, in which a number of prominent bloggers took off from the
official topic “how blogging has changed our lives” to discuss the role of
bloggers / public intellectuals in social and political transformation.

**We must Blog**

> 刘晓原:有条件的网友要多开博客

> 博客是个好东西，我开过20多个博客，现在经常使用的还有十多个。08年我的博客关注社会事件和法制案件。最后杨佳案虽然让我失望，但是参与至少还算留下了一些痕迹。我为杨佳案写过140多篇博客。我还关注过汶川地震能否预测的问题，关注过那些死难的教师，为此我还给教育部写过信。如果没有博客，我想发表一个观点，就得去找媒体记者。但是博客改变了这一程序，现在是媒体记者主动找我。所以，我希望有条件的网友多开博客，把你的观点通过博客表达出来。
