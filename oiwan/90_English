Many people have the impression that Hong Kong is a concrete forest made up
with high rise buildings. However, actually 75% of the land in this global
city is undeveloped country side. Such landscape is an unintended result of
the colonial history, when after the WWII, the British government tried to
sustain the water supply of the city by building a number of reservoirs in
countryside.

The above slides show one of the 10 greatest sceneries in Hong Kong: the Tai
Long Wan beach. The natural beach is located in the Sai Kung East Country Park
and accessible only by walk. However, on July 16 a local newspapers, South
China Morning Post, exposed that a large private residence was under
construction in the upper Sai Wan Village directly behind the beach. The
person behind the construction project is local businessman Simon Lo Lin-
shing, chairman of [Mongolia Energy
Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia_Energy_Corporation).

In reaction to the news, concerned citizens immediately formed [a
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=119731658073048&ref=search#!/group.php?gid=119731658073048&v=info)
in facebook calling for action:

> Sai Wan, Tai Long Wan, is the latest in a long sad list of destruction of
> Hong Kong's core assets. Enough is enough – We are “Friends of Tai Long Sai
> Wan”, let's make this the last stand in the battle for better planning of
> our beautiful city before it is too late.

In less than a week, more than 65,420 facebook users have joined in the group.
On July 18, the members of the group organized a field trip to the beach, and
inmediahk.net's contributing reporter eg9515 joined the team, interviewed the
head of Sai Wan Village and [reported](http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1007734)
on the situation:

> 據黎村長指，魯連城透過中間人，買下該幅農地及旁邊的七間丁屋，將會改建成私人花園，設施包括小型高爾夫球場、直升機坪及游泳池，中間人
> 更表示魯先生「一年頂多會在這裡十次。」

According to the head of the village Mr. Lai, Simon Lo bought the village farm
land and 7 village houses for building a private campus. The facilities will
include a small golf court, a helicopter port, a swimming pool. The middle
person said that Mr Lo will go to the spot at most a dozen times a year.

Another villager said that old village houses would be torn down for luxurious
housing. Below is a video taken by eg9519 showing the 100 thousand square feet
construction site and the bulldozers at the ground level:

To everyone surprise, on 20 of July, a netizen from the facebook group
[discovered (via eg9515's report) ](http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1007754)
that the construction is actually a archaeological site of an ancient lagoon.
The government geographical information website (file number AM78-0214) states
that the value of the Sai Wan archaeological site has been established in the
80s and in 2006, archaeologists dug out a large number of ancient pottery from
the Neolithic Age in the Sai Wan upper village. Here is the government
[report](http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/TPCST_Final_Report.pdf)
and below is the screen capture of the government map indicating the location
of the ancient lagoon and archaeological site:

Environment expert, C.Y Jim from HKU Geography Department, also joined in the
conversation upon receiving an email from member of the facebook group calling
for advice. Below is [his opinion on the
case](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=119731658073048&topic=162):

> (1) Even though the land is privately owned, it is meant for agricultural
> use. Any departure from this customary use has to be approved by the
> government. The quasi-statutory instrument to enforce the land use control
> is enshrined in the block crown lease (now block government lease) imposed
> on all farmlands in the New Territories shortly after British leasing of NT
> from the Qing government. The Lands Department is the government agency in
> charge of enforcing land use control.
>
> (2) Building water ponds (for recreational or amenity purpose rather than
> aquaculture) and tennis courts are unrelated to agricultural use, hence they
> should be considered as illegal land uses.
>
> (3) Building houses for domestic use that is directly related to
> agricultural production would need approval from the Lands Department. I
> understand that existing sheds could be rebuilt but subject to tight
> restrictions on floor area and height. I believe that the site does not
> contain existing sheds or other covered structures, hence the new owner has
> no existing right to build a house on it.
>
> (4) The adjacent plot behind Tai Long Wan (TLW, the main beach) is covered
> by a Rural Outline Zoning Plan (ROZP) dated 2006. The farmland has been
> designated mainly as Conservation Area (CA), and a strip of land adjacent to
> the beach has been zoned Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The two
> existing villages, namely Ham Tin and Tai Long, have been zoned Village (V).
> It is obvious that the planning intention is to protect nature from

> conservation worth of TLSW, for all intents and purposes, is equivalent to
> TLW. The fact that TLSW is not covered by a Development Permission Area
> (DPA) Plan or ROZP is due to negligence or oversight.

In order to press the government to stop the project, netizens called for
complaint
[email](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=119731658073048&topic=166) and
[phone call](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=119731658073048&topic=165)
campaigns. Serveral government departments finally stepped in and gave warning
to the construction. Today Mr. Lo told the mainstream media that he would
suspend the construction. Since the incident has exposed the local planning
loophole that would destroy nature landscape, local legislators and
environmental groups continue to urge the govenment to amend law and demand
any construction plan near the country park areas should have proper
environmental evaluation and be approved by the environmental department.
