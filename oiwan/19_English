Threats of political violence in Hong Kong are rising rapidly in the wake of
September 4 legislative elections. Newly elected lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi Dick
reported to the police on September 8 that he received “credible death
threats” against him and his family after the election.

Though Chu received more votes than any other candidate in the September 4
legislative election, public support has not safeguarded him from political
threats.

As an activist and investigative journalist, Chu has worked in recent years to
expose collusion between the Hong Kong government, developers, rural
indigenous leaders and triads (Chinese organized crime groups) regarding land
development in the [New
Territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Territories), a region of Hong
Kong. In May this year, a village chief in Yuen Long warned Chu that if he
continued to advocate for the construction of 17,000 public housing units in
Wang Chau district, he would be attacked after election day on September 4.

Indigenous inhabitants of New Territories is a legal term invented by the
colonial British government in the 1970s. It refers to the people descended
through the male line from a person who had already settled in Hong Kong since
1898. This group of people enjoy a special right to build a small house in the
New Territories if they can find suitable land. The status of indigenous
inhabitants has to be approved by a group of village leaders who are in
control of indigenous villages’ genealogies.

This group of rural leaders have become a powerful force in the New
Territories, and extended their power to the government as this power is
endorsed by Beijing through the system of [functional
constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_constituency_\(Hong_Kong\))
in the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive election committee.

Chu nevertheless questioned the rural leaders’ representatives during the
election debate. On September 4, Chu was followed by two vehicles and saw a
man taking photos of him and his election team members. Local media later
[exposed that one of the
vehicles](http://www.hk01.com/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/42019/%E8%AA%B0%E5%9C%A8%E8%B7%9F%E8%B9%A4%E6%9C%B1%E5%87%B1%E5%BB%B8-%E6%8A%95%E7%A5%A8%E6%97%A5%E9%A9%85%E8%BB%8A%E4%BA%A6%E6%AD%A5%E4%BA%A6%E8%B6%A8-%E8%BB%8A%E4%B8%BB%E6%B6%89%E5%A4%9A%E6%AC%A1%E5%88%91%E4%BA%8B%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84)
belongs to a man with a long criminal record.

Apart from Chu, another newly elected lawmaker from Western New Territories,
Andrew Wan Siu-kin, also received a [violent
threat](http://www.hk01.com/%E7%AB%8B%E6%B3%95%E6%9C%83%E9%81%B8%E8%88%89/41055/-%E7%AB%8B%E6%9C%83%E9%81%B8%E6%88%B0-%E5%B0%B9%E5%85%86%E5%A0%85%E6%94%B6%E5%88%80%E7%89%87%E6%81%90%E5%9A%87%E4%BF%A1-%E8%AD%A6%E5%88%97%E5%88%91%E4%BA%8B%E6%81%90%E5%9A%87%E6%A1%88).
The Democratic Party member found that someone had poured flammable liquid all
over his election vehicle on September 2. The next day, he received a letter
containing an incendiary device.

Since September 4, Chu and his family have not returned to their home home,
fearing for their safety. A credible source revealed that the triad society
had offered a price for Chu's killing.

Before he filed a report with police, Chu explained his situation in a press
conference (statement via [Eddie Chu’s

The Hong Kong police are now providing Chu and his family with round-the-clock
protection.

Democratic Party spokespeople say they believe Chu was targeted because he
interfered with the illegal transfer of indigenous inhabitants’ rights in the
development of small house units.

According to local “[small house
policy](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/01/21/explainer-hong-kongs-divisive-
small-house-policy/)”, indigenous villagers in the New Territories have the
right to build a house of their own. This right is non-transferable. However,
secret deals are often made between rural elites and developers, and triad
leaders also have stepped in to force indigenous villagers to transfer their
land rights.

The Hong Kong government has turned a blind eye to the illegal transfer of
these rights because both the triad and rural elites in the New Territories
are generally loyal to Beijing.

This is not a brand new conflict. In 2013, [members of
triads](https://therealnewshk.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/cy-leung-town-hall-
meeting-leungs-supporters-are-triads/) mobilised to demonstrate support and
safeguard Hong Kong’s top leader Leung Chun Ying’s town hall meeting from pro-
democracy protesters.

During the September 4 Legislative election, two newly elected lawmakers,
Leung Che-cheung and Junius Ho Kwan Yiu, representing rural privilege groups
and triad-controlled developers’ interests were blessed by the Liaison Office
of the Central Government in Hong Kong.

A number of[ civic organisations have issued
statements](“http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1044521”) condemning the
persecution of Chu and others like him and urging the police to put an end to
political violence that threatens the rule of law and freedom of speech.

Chu [vowed](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/08/police-provide-protection-
newly-elected-lawmaker-eddie-chu-death-threats/) that he would not submit to
political violence after he reported the case to the police:

> I will not submit to this kind of political violence – I will continue to
> fulfill my election promises, to monitor the government and make Hong Kong
> better.
>
> I should be an example in protecting Hong Kong people’s freedom of speech,
> our freedom to express political views. We should not back down in the face
> of any violent threats – this is my promise to Hong Kong people.
