Christmas is approaching but instead of feeling joyful, many in mainland China
have expressed frustration over China's ideological campaign against Christmas
as a Western festival.

In 2017, the Communist Party of China's central committee and state council
issued an official document entitled [“Suggestions on the implementation of
projects to promote and develop traditional Chinese culture
excellence”](http://www.xinhuanet.com//politics/2017-01/25/c_1120383155.htm).
They outlined a cultural revival project that lists Chinese festivals like the
Lunar New Year and the Lantern Festival, among others, as cultural conventions
worthy of celebration.

To implement this policy, Chinese authorities have launched a series of
ideological campaigns to crack down on non-Chinese celebrations. This year,
just before Christmas, authorities in some cities [such as
Langfang,](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B/article/20181218/s00013/1545070842847/%E6%B2%B3%E5%8C%97%E5%BB%8A%E5%9D%8A%E7%A6%81%E8%A1%97%E9%A0%AD%E6%93%BA%E8%81%96%E8%AA%95%E9%A3%BE%E5%93%81-%E5%AD%B8%E8%80%85-%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E6%8A%B5%E5%88%B6%E8%A5%BF%E6%96%B9%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96)
in Hebei province, have demanded shops to remove Christmas decorations on the
streets and in window displays.

Anti-Western festival commentaries have flooded Chinese social media, making
Christmas celebrations a difficult choice for some who feel they must keep
their joy a secret.

Screen capture of news feed on anti-western festival commentaries on Weibo.

Weibo user Long Zhigao [screen captured his WeChat
newsfeed](https://www.weibo.com/2403507164/H8fDQofpy) on Weibo to reveal
aspects of the debate. The headlines on the feed are 1. Western festival is
approaching. To celebrate or not, that’s the question. 2. I am Chinese and I
don’t celebrate Western festivals. 3. Say no to the celebration of Western
festivals on the school campus. 4. The party-state has banned Western
festivals. The celebration of festivals is now a political issue.

In addition to Christmas, the list of Western festivals also includes
Valentine’s Day, Easter and Halloween, among others. A majority of the
commentaries define Western festivals as “cultural invasion” or “national
humiliation”.

For example, a widely circulated one
[said](https://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309634317902818942016):

> 如果一个民族的群体热衷于另一个民族的节日，这说明文化入侵已是极其严重了。党员干部如果认识不到这点，那就是丧失政治敏锐性，也失去了先进性。

> If people of a nation are too enthusiastic in celebrating other nations’
> festivals, it indicates that the country is suffered from extremely serious
> cultural invasion. If party members and government officials are not aware
> of this, it means that they are not politically sensitive and have lost
> their progressiveness.

The commentary references the history of the [Eight-Nation
Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance), a coalition
formed in response to the Boxer Rebellion in China between 1899 and 1901 when
Chinese peasants rose up against foreign, colonial, Christian rule and
culture. It further argues that the birthday of Mao Zedong, the founding
father of the People's Republic of China, should be treated as China’s
Christmas:

> 中国人民共和国第一任主席毛泽东，是他拯救人民与水火之中，我们应该将他的诞辰定为中国的圣诞节，拒绝洋节，从自己做起！

> The first Chairman of the Republic of China Mao Zedong had saved people from
> misery. We should make his birthday Chinese Christmas. Act and reject
> Western festivals.

But many on Weibo found these arguments illogical. One commentator said:

> 洋人过春节，中国人自豪，叫传统文化振兴……  
>  中国人过个洋节，怎么又叫外来文化入侵了呢?  
>  年轻过个洋节，只是图个热闹，又拉动消费，哪里不好?  
>  有些人，把过个圣诞节和160年前的民族耻辱又扯上了，何必呢? ​

> When Westerners celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, Chinese people are so
> proud and see the phenomena as the revival of Chinese traditional culture …
> When Chinese people celebrate Western festivals, what's the point of
> labeling them as culture invasion? Young people celebrate Western festivals
> for fun and joy. The festivals can boost consumption, what’s wrong with
> that?  
>  Some people try to draw connection between celebrating Christmas and the
> national humiliation that happened 160 years ago. For what?

### Social pressure, self-censorship

The flood of anti-Christmas comments on social media has generated pressure
for some social media users to self-censor. A Weibo user expressed
[frustration](https://weibo.com/1280932642/H8eAbo32Q):

>
> 快圣诞了，朋友圈里的洋节反对派和反反对派又开始刚上了。爱过过不爱过拉倒呗，没必要非逼着别人认同自己的看法，所有人都站一边不挤啊？真要都站一边了，本来站在中间的我们为了保持平衡就只能站到另一边去了。

> Christmas is approaching. In my friend circle, anti-Western festival camps
> and anti-anti Western festival camps are debating. Whether one likes to
> celebrate or not is none of others’ business, why do people just have to
> force others to agree with their view? Everyone standing on one side is too
> crowded. For those of us who are in the middle, in order to create a
> balance, we have to stand on the other side.

School notice against the celebration of Western festivals on campus.

Pressure goes beyond social media platforms, extending to institutions such as
schools and corporations.

Some Weibo users have shared school notices that were distributed to students.
One of the notices (right) refers to the “Suggestions” mandate and urges
teachers and students to resist Western style celebrations.

It also demands students to spread anti-Western messages to friends and family
members on Wechat and other mobile messaging applications.

One mother was surprised to find her child rejecting her offer of a Christmas
gift. She wrote on Weibo:

> 👩：宝宝，你想要什么🎄圣诞礼物？  
>  👶：我不过洋节，因为圣诞节不是我们中国人自己的节日！
>
> 好吧，  
>  果然是党和人民的好宝宝

> Mother: Baby, what do you want for Christmas gift?  
>  Child: I will not celebrate Western festivals Christmas is not a Chinese
> people’s festival.  
>  OK, you are definitely an obedient baby of the Party and the People.

However, high school and college students were more critical. One student
questioned school policy on Weibo:

>
> 学校范围内不让出现一切和Christmas有关的东西，不能互赠礼物，不能有装饰物，不让过所谓的“洋节”，这到底是要弘扬传统文化，还是对自己文化的一种不自信

> The school has banned Christmas decorations on campus and forbidden students
> to exchange gifts so as to campaign against Western festivals. Are all these
> measures to enhance and promote Chinese culture or a sign of losing
> confidence on one’s own culture?

Some have chosen to celebrate the festival in secret. A Weibo user said:

> 公司不让过“洋节”，人事小姐姐提前偷偷给发的平安果。预祝平平安安。

> The company has forbidden the celebration of Western festivals. But the
> secretary in the personnel department has handed out a Christmas apple
> [common Christmas gift] to the staff members in secret. Let’s wish for
> peace.

Another Weibo user expressed his view with a Christmas wish:

> 圣诞快乐！上帝我爱你！请圣诞老人给我一只大大的袜子，里面装着自由。

> Merry Christmas! I love you god! Santa Claus, pls give me a big big sock
> with freedom in it.
