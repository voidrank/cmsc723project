the Chengdu, China office of popular US-based crowd-sourced taxi service Uber
on May 6, about a week after its Guangzhou office was raided on accusations of
operating without a license and conducting illegal business.

Officials claimed that the crackdown was part of a [comprehensive
operation](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-01/uber-china-
offices-raided-in-crackdown-on-taxi-hailing-services) against unlicensed
taxis; China is certainly not the first country go after Uber for that reason.
But some believe the raids had other motives — to protect domestic taxi-
hailing services by clamping down on a foreign competitor.

Uber made its debut in China in February 2014 and currently operates in about
10 Chinese cities. Its deal with Baidu, the country's biggest search engine,
in December 2014 has given the app access to Baidu's map and boosted its
business in China.

But in January 2015, China's Ministry of Transportation [announced a
ban](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/08/china-taxi-app-crack-down/) on private
cars offering unlicensed taxi rides via mobile apps. Not long after, China's
two largest domestic operators of taxi-hailing apps — Kuaidi Dache, backed by
Alibaba Group, and Didi Dache, backed by Tecent Holdings –[ decided to
merge](http://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-alibaba-backed-chinese-taxi-
hailing-apps-to-merge-1423883210). They claimed they would more closely
monitor services by connecting their passengers to cars owned by rental
agencies — licensed third parties according to guidelines set by the Ministry
of Transportation.

In March, Didi Dache held talks with Uber for a [partnership
arrangement](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/china-uber-
idUSL3N0WS42720150330) that would monopolize the market. Uber did not comment
on the news.

In seems that Uber is in favor of competition. In addition to working with
private car rental agencies, Uber China has developed a “People's Uber”
carpooling strategy to recruit more private cars into its network. Thomas Luo,
a tech blogger, praised the company's courage to set up such [a
platform](http://www.pingwest.com/thomas-luo-peoples-uber-peoples-war/):

> 尽管大量低价车充斥着人民优步的市场[…]司机试图在意用户的感受并尽量满足乘客的需求——这种平衡让Uber在中国获得了“人民性”。而获得了“人民性”的Uber和它的“人民优步”服务，事实上成为了一个将那些被摒弃在出租车营运体系和资格之外的私家车们（官方亲切地称之为“黑车”）凝聚和组织在一起的“另一个出租车”营运体系，一个依靠人民群众，放手发动群众的出行供需平台。[…]也正是因为如此，它让竞争对手恐慌——微信平台曾多次以“恶意营销”为名封禁Uber在各个城市的运营公众号[…]

But the Chinese authorities are not a fan of this “people-oriented” business
strategy. Luo believed Uber's foreign background is the main reason behind the
crackdown:

>
> 对一家试图在中国开展业务的美国科技公司来说，保守和矜持会遭到轻视和“不接地气”的嘲笑，但决绝和生猛毫无疑问会遇到更严酷的反扑——2008年的Google中国和现在的Uber都是这样的例子。  
>
> 但Uber在中国面临的并非Google当年的窘境——Google在中国的业务从第一天起就有文化与意识形态的壁垒，最终的结局也是由于双方（Google与中国监管机构）之间无可调和的价值分歧。而Uber不同，更方便、更实惠和更有赚头的利益驱动是放之四海而皆准的普世价值，而其遭遇的一些被触动利益的主管机构的制裁与打压

In addition to the raids on Uber's offices, Chinese police has been targeting
Uber drivers in major cities, some going undercover by calling cabs through
the application as customers.

However, Luo was quite optimistic about Uber's future. He believes that people
will develop their own strategies to tackle the crackdown:

>
> 看看在人民优步被严厉打压的北京和广州正在发生的事吧——打开Uber应用，5分钟以内可到的“人民优步”轿车仍然密布在地图上随处可见。可能一些司机会提前打电话过来摸一下情况，判断一下是不是被“钓鱼执法”，可能有的司机会跟你商量“咱们到机场直接下停车场，省得被查”，还有的人会跟你约定接头方式和暗号，但一个基本的事实是：活照拉[…]

He urges people to take sides and support “People's Uber”:

>
> 这是一场人民优步的人民战争。我们来自五湖四海，为了更自由方便地出行的目的，走到一起来了。当你接到人民优步司机小心谨慎地询问的电话的时候，多给一点理解和耐心——这就是你们接头的暗号。每一个乘客和每一个司机的每一次接头和交易，都指向一条真正通向自由之路。

Judging from the reactions on social media, Uber indeed has won the support of
many. But the country's policies do not necessarily side with the people, as
implied in Audrey Li's
[observation](http://www.weibo.com/1649750547/CgugrpEuy?type=comment)
regarding Chinese journalist Michael Anti's comment on the crackdown in
Twitter-like Weibo:

> 关于广州查封Uber总部，安替有句精彩评论：感觉政府解决交通问题无能，但解决能解决交通问题的人非常有能力。

> Concerning the crackdown on Uber's Guangzhou office, Micheal Anti has a very

Public transportation is usually very poor in over-populated Chinese cities.
That's why Michael Anti's comment is echoed by many in the post thread, such
as this one:

> 不解决群众提出的问题！而解决提出问题的群众

> It won't solve the question raised by people, but it will “solve” those who
> raise the question.
