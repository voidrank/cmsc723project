A Chinese activist was reportedly [beaten and
detained](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1250041/school-sexual-abuse-
protester-ye-haiyan-beaten) by local authorities in Guangxi province of China,
a few days after she demonstrated in front of a primary school whose principal
allegedly sexually abused six school girls.

Ye Haiyan stood outside the Wanning primary school in Hainan on May 27, 2013
holding a poster that read, “Principals, spare the school kids, get a hotel
room with me instead!” A photo of her demonstration circulated widely on
Chinese social media, with many emulating the protest.

Later that week, after returning home in Guangxi from Hainan, local police
officers had raided her home and were
[assaulting](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1250041/school-sexual-
abuse-protester-ye-haiyan-beaten) her while her daughter was present.

In less than one month, the local media have exposed [more than eight cases of
sexual abuse](http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2013-05-30/014027261359.shtml) [zh] of
school children. As far as the media reported, the molesters are school
principals, teachers, and security staffs.

The reported cases are just the tip of an iceberg, according to research from
[All-China Women's Federation (ACWF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-
China_Women%27s_Federation). In the past three years, there were [more than
2,506 cases of sexual abuse of girls within Guangdong
province](http://news.163.com/13/0529/21/902TAIJR00014JB6.html) [zh] alone.
Half of the victims are children under 14 and 65 percent of the molesters are
acquaintance of their victim's family.

The revelation of the sexual abuse allegedly by the Wanning primary school
principal once again legally labelled the child victims as “underage
prostitutes” in line with the country's [“underage prostitution
law”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/08/china-outrage-as-underage-
prostitution-law-protects-child-rapists/), which labels the victims so when
the suspects can prove that they offered money or gifts to the children in the
process.

Even though the Supreme People's Court has vowed to crack down child sexual
abuse, without legal reform such as the abolition of that law, the criminals
will not be brought to justice as rapists.

But the women organization ACWF, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party,
has not reacted with calls for legal reform. Instead, it responded to the evil
crime by publishing [a
handbook](http://news.jwb.com.cn/art/2013/5/30/art_189_2996516.html) [zh] to
teach school children how to say no to molesters.

As [Children's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children' data-versionurl=)
on June 1 approaches, Chinese on social media have directed their anger toward
authorities, such as the Ministry of Education and the ACWF, for leaving
children unprotected and vulnerable to sexual abuse in China.

Many netizens followed Ye's dark-humored protest example on Sina Weibo. Below

Weibo user “Speaking genuinely” (@1句實話) [wrote
that](http://weibo.com/2562810123/zz3c56P6n) [zh] the current law is
protecting the criminals rather than children:

> 六一儿童节将至，儿童是祖国的花朵，保护儿童，尤其是幼女是国家的责任。1949建国以后，法律尚不健全。但面对强奸幼女的罪犯，国家一律判处死刑。[…]
> 自从“嫖宿”一词发明后，禽兽开始肆无忌惮，都是谁在保护禽兽？

>
> 這些來自底層的吶喊，無疑是對相關部門不作為的巨大諷刺，體制各種婦女兒童權益組織一應俱全，結果却只做花瓶與擺設，正是由一官辦組織的不作為，才助長了整個社會對婦女兒童權益的忽略、歧視與戕害！「開房找我」讓所有中國人感到了這種痛楚，正是這種共同的痛楚，讓這一行為藝術被無數網友接力。

> 「六一」兒童節即將到來，試想如果人們要在接二連三的猥褻女生案中迎接這個節日，這個社會怎麼對得住我們的孩子。校園本應是庇知孩子的天堂，老師在校園裡把魔爪伸向自己的學生？「校長，開房找我，放過小學生！」這是當下「性侵幼女」社會暴力的一種黑色幽默式反抗。當女學生被性侵的丑聞衝擊我們的底綫時，葉海燕喊出的更像是泣血之音。

> 一百年前魯迅先生反封建禮制吃人的「救救孩子」吶喊，如今仍振聾發聵：一場斬斷校長伸向女童黑手的呼請接力正在進行。「開房找我」的調侃體現更多的是無奈，是對當下「性侵幼女」社會暴力的一種黑色幽默式反抗，是對教育亂象無聲抗議！

[“Volunteer Ma Qi”](http://weibo.com/u/2137900980) [zh] (@志愿者马奇) spelled out a
plan of action to help the situation:

> 1、家长会得到一个说法，罪犯依强奸罪拘捕。2、教育部与妇联应有个回应，该肃整队伍的拿出方案来，妇联必须有个态度。3、废除嫖宿幼女罪。
