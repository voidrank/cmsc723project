The year 2013 began and now ends with anti-censorship drama of liberal Chinese
newspaper Southern Weekend.

The Southern Media Group, which owns Southern Weekend, issued testimony in
November 2013 that helps the prosecution of activists who took part in an
[anti-censorship](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/01/08/censorship-meets-
rare-defiance-as-journalists-strike-in-china/) protest in early January
outside corporation's building. Southern Weekend had issued an editorial
appeal for readers’ support against the provincial propaganda department's
pressure to rewrite its New Year editorial.

Activists Guo Feixiong, Liu Yuandong, Sun Desheng were prosecuted by the
Guangzhou police of disrupting the public order in the protest. Guo Feixiong
was [accused](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1355965/dissident-guo-
feixiong-protests-detention-25-day-hunger-strike) of being the mastermind
behind the protest in support of the newspaper and has been detained since
August 2013.

According to the written testimony submitted to the police, which was made
public on September 27, 2013 via [Wen
Yunchao](https://plus.google.com/108105216183622857074/posts/Lg19L2yHcdU), the
public gathering outside the building between January 6 to 9 obstructed their
daily work as people and vehicles could not enter freely from the front gate.
The company had to open the side gate for their staff and some meetings and
activities were cancelled.

Guo Feixiong's lawyer, Chang Xuezhong, explained the impact of the testimony
at the trial on popular microblogging site Sina Weibo. His post was deleted
quickly. Zhou Sheng backed up his tweet in his article, [“Better For Southern
Weekend to Die Back Then Than Being Alive for Today's Humiliation”
](http://www.52rkl.cn/zhenhua/122Q42132013.html)(南周 恨不当年死 留作今日羞):

>
> 南方报业传媒集团出具的情况说明，完全是为了配合警方的指控，提供构成聚众扰乱公共场所秩序罪的后果要件。《南方周末》当初呼吁人们去声援它，现在却说声援它的人们影响了工作秩序，如此颠倒黑白，恩将仇报，助纣为虐，怎么还好意思一期一期地把报纸印出来？

The Southern Media Group's statement has outraged many. Yu Jianrong, a famous
public intellectual, said on Weibo (post deleted but [backed
up](http://www.52rkl.cn/zhenhua/122Q42132013.html) by Zhou Sheng):

>
> 今年建最后悔的事，年初为声援南周，我曾将自己的微博头像换成黑体‘南方周末’字样，现郑重向我的关注者道歉，并保证，如南周不能客观报道或者说明当时的情况，给声援者一个客观公正，我绝不再接受这份报纸的任何采访，绝不再在这份报纸发表任何文字。

> The most regretful thing this year was to express my support for Southern
> Weekend. I even changed my profile picture into grey-coloured “Southern
> Weekend” back then. Now I have to apologize to my readers and promise that
> if Southern Weekend fails to report and explain the situation objectively
> and fairly, I would never accept the paper's interview again and would never
> write for this paper.

Matthew Pang, a former employee of Southern Media Group, urged his former
colleagues to speak out against the corporation's statement:

>
> 南方报业已经从报界启蒙先驱，沦落为打压（追求）民主自由的打手。在这里，我还真要对仍在这个报业集团工作的前前同事们，进行一次道德“胁迫”：如果你们对南方报业那份落井下石的声明默不作声，我不是你们的朋友。如果你们对曾声援自己的义士的遭遇视而不见，你们也配不上“记者”这个职业！

Wen Yunchao has been keeping track of reporters and editors who have spoken
out against the statement. Within a day, about 20 employees from the Southern
Media Group had bashed the paper's testimony. She Feike, who was also working
at one of the media outlets owned by the Group in January 2013,
[wrote](https://plus.google.com/108105216183622857074/posts/hFVE9R2e5yM):
