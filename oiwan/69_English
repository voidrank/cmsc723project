Hidden Agenda has been rated as one of the best live music venues in Hong Kong
by [CNNGo](http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/indie-music-venues-903611). The
indie music space has been in the industrial neighborhood of Kwun Tong for
many years, as the factory district is planned to be a hub for local cultural
and creative activities.

However, contradictory to the government's policy to promote cultural and
creative industries, since 2010, some government departments have kept
[harassing](http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/play/hong-kongs-underground-venue-
hidden-agenda-refuses-close-165446) performance venues and live concerts, as
autonomous creative space in Hong Kong is unprotected by existing law. In the
past two years, Hidden Agenda has been harassed by the police at least twice,
before and during their music shows.

The latest police harassment happened during the weekend of March 18, 2012,
when two overseas indie bands, [Israeli “Art Rock” Eatliz and Turtle Giant
from Macau](http://www.facebook.com/events/156537284466200) [zh], were about
to perform in the venue.

Quncy Lau posted more than 30 photos showing the police officers “carrying out
their duty” on

Hidden Agenda. Mar 18.  
They intentionally picked the time when the show is about to start to check
the fire alarm system. Two dozen police officers accompanied one fireman to
carry out the duty.

Hidden Agenda has been forced to relocate twice because of the lack of legal
protection on their creative activities. Wong Chun Kok explained the

Back in January 2010, under the stimulation of government's policy on
revitalizing the industrial buildings, the warehouse where Hidden Agenda was
founded was bought up by a developer and we were forced to leave. Before we
left, we organized a series of music concerts under the title “About to be
Blocked” and more than 20 local indie and street performance groups joined us.
Two years later, the old venue was still empty…

In the past two years, we gained recognition from society and have been rated
as the best music performance venue in Hong Kong. Even the France Culture
Association and the government's Leisure and Cultural Services Department have
started renting our venue despite the fact that we do not have any license
that authorizes us to run the space. According to existing regulations, all
music performance, art exhibitions and theatrical performances in factory
buildings are considered illegal. We have tried contacting the government to
deal with the problem actively, but the Land Department, Food and
Environmental Hygiene Department and even the Building Department keep on
harassing us.

The second relocation happened in September 2011, this time under the pressure
of the government's Land Department. Before they left, they organized another
series of indie music concerts under the theme [“East Kowloon Industrial
Space”](http://www.inmediahk.net/hidden-

The fact is no matter where you would have moved, they would follow you.  
Hidden Agenda has moved to a new location now, the police come to harass
again.  
If we really think Hong Kong needs indie music live venues like Hidden Agenda  
Or more space for creative activities  
As an audience, apart from supporting HA by paying the ticket prices to
shoulder the expensive rent,  
Don't we have to get organized and defend them?  
The media has a lot of reports on this, but that doesn't stop the harassment.  
Let's figure out how to take action  
Society has to give feedback to our voices and demands  
Art must be returned to the people.

Indeed, Hidden Agenda is not the only victim of the policy contradiction. Back
in September 2011, another indie music performance in a more remote industrial
district in North West Kowloon was subject to a crackdown by police officers.

Wong Chun Kok [described the
situation](http://www.inmediahk.net/%E6%8A%B1%E6%AD%89%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%99%E5%80%8B%E9%98%B2%E6%9A%B4%E7%9B%BE%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E9%9A%94%E9%9F%B3)

On 3 September, my friends picked up a remote spot in Kwai Chung Industrial
District for a rooftop music concert. They got the inspiration from the
American band Jefferson Airplane's 1968 roof top performance, a year before
the Beatles’ rooftop performance. The biggest difference was that Jefferson
Airplane's concert was in the center of Manhattan, the Beatles’ was in the
center of Liverpool and they started in broad daylight. But we are used to
hearing our music in remote industrial districts at night.

Because most Hong Kong people do not understand music.

My experience has told me that no matter how remote your concert spot, the
police will stop a music concert by force whenever they received complaints
about the noise. Even though more than 1,000 or 10,000 people are enjoying the
music, one complaint would ruin the whole thing. And you have to obey whatever
the police say… This time, in order to protect the concert, the audience
formed a human shield, then the police brought their anti-riot shields. Maybe
it was too dark and they mistook the guitars for some huge swords. Then the
police officers arrested the audience and locked them up on the rooftop. Some
of my friends were yelling: “we are just playing music, do you have to do
this?” The police officers only returned angry stares.
