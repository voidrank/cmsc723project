On August 5, about two dozen Fujianese picked a fight with anti-extradition
protesters in North Point. Screen capture from Youtube video.

A large number of residents of Fujian, a
[province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian) on the southeast coast of
China, have announced they will be travelling to Hong Kong to beat up [anti-
extradition protesters](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/the-people-
of-hong-kong-vs-the-china-extradition-bill/) during protests in the next few
days.

Messages about the recruitment of cross-border attackers have spread all over
the Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo in the past week. Comments
and reactions suggest such an aggressive move is being praised as ‘heroic’ by
large numbers of mainland Chinese citizens.

In Hong Kong, local residents are fearful, as they have not seen many measures
taken by Hong Kong authorities to stop the foretold criminal acts, except
notices posted on residential buildings instructing residents near protest
areas not to go out and to shut their apartment windows on August 11.

**Mob attacks in Tsuen Wan and North Point on August 5**

After the [mob attacks on anti-extradition protesters in Yuen
Long](https://globalvoices.org/2019/07/22/armed-mobs-attack-anti-extradition-
protesters-in-a-suburban-hong-kong-subway-station/) on July 21, various media
outlets reported that the [China’s Liaison Office in Hong
Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Liaison_Office) had encouraged
pro-Beijing forces to block district-level protests in a gathering with
village heads.

Despite public outrage, similar mob attacks have been observed in at least two
other districts, including Tsuen Wan in the western part of Kowloon, and North
Point in the eastern part of Hong Kong Island during the [general strike, and
in various district protests](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-
kong/politics/article/3021436/hong-kong-protesters-gather-seven-locations-
citywide-strike) on August 5.

In Tsuen Wan, a mob wearing blue T-shirts was spotted on the streets at around
8pm, carrying sticks and other weapons. Upon receiving the news, a large group
of anti-extradition protesters rushed to the spot and chased them away. But at
around 11pm, when the majority of the protesters had left the scene, a group
armed with weapons appeared on the streets to [pick a fight and a 18-year-old
man wearing a black T-shirt was chopped](https://www.hk01.com/突發/360511/荃灣黑夜-
白衣人施襲片段曝光-救人陳皓桓-一個捉住-一個斬) on his head, arm and leg by two white-shirted thugs
on the sidewalk. Passers-by came to the rescue and the incident triggered yet
another street fight between protesters and thugs. Three people suspected of
starting the attack were beaten, tied up by protesters and left on the street
for an ambulance and police to pick up.

In North Point, a group of thugs was spotted at a street corner waiting for
protesters to pass by and pick a fight. But they were outnumbered by
protesters and defeated quickly. @jesuispopple posted this video of the
confrontation on Twitter:

In both incidents, police officers were absent from the streets, and in the
case of the North Point, police officers only arrived at the conflict scene
four hours after the crowd had already dispersed. The police authorities later
[stated](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1473081-20190806.htm) that
the police station in North Point had been blocked by protesters, though in
Hong Kong every district has a police station and it takes less than 15
minutes for another district to send backup forces.

#### **Beijing's Fujianese loyalists mobilize on WeChat and Weibo**

Residents from North Point and Tsuen Wan quickly identified the attacking
thugs as Fujianese, as they spoke the [ Hokkien or Minnan
dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien).

Hong Kong is a immigrant society and the majority of people who move to settle
in the territory come from mainland China. About [1.68
million](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%97%BD%E5%8D%97%E8%AF%AD) of them
are Fujianese immigrants and their descendants. Both Tsuen Wan and North Point
have become traditional residential districts for people who identify as
Fujianese and migrated to Hong Kong in 1980s and 1990s. This community
maintains close links with their relatives back in the province of Fujian in
mainland China. Such communities also socialize in Hong Kong through village
or town-level kinship associations called Tongxianghui, through which they
connect with compatriots from the same hometown.

After the [handover of Hong
Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover_of_Hong_Kong) to China in 1997,
Beijing started considering and using Tongxianhui from Fujian and other
provinces in China as a key mechanism for exercising political influence in
Hong Kong, particularly during elections. Among hundreds of Tongxianhui in
Hong Kong, the ones from Fujian province are the most loyal to Beijing.
However, second- and third-generation Fujianese in Hong Kong have distanced
themselves from Beijing’s political control, and some have joined the anti-
extradition protests.

Interestingly, the current director of the China's Liaison Office in Hong
Kong, [Wang Zhiming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Zhimin), is Fujianese.
He graduated from Fujian Normal University, and became a member of the Fujian
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He then became the
director of the China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong in 2017.

After the clashes between Fujianese mobs and anti-extradition protesters took
on August 5, a large number of mobilization messages appeared on WeChat
groups. But Fujianese supporters of the anti-extradition protests leaked the
message on the Reddit-like LIHKG and Facebook. Below is a screen capture of a
message posted on a Fujianese WeChat group:

An online poster of “patriotic Fujianese” has gone viral on major social media
platforms in mainland China.

Chats about the mobilization of Fujianese “fighters” to Hong Kong also
circulated on Weibo. Large numbers of netizens do in fact cheer on this
“patriotic act”. Here is a typical

As a result of censorship, the majority of mainland Chinese people know very
little about the anti-extradition protests. They believe that the current
protest is a pro-Hong Kong independence [color revolution sponsored by foreign
forces](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/08/beijing-deems-hong-kong-
protests-colour-revolution-will-not-rule-intervention/).

Both local media outlets and the police authorities were notified of the
Fujianese plan to pick fight with protesters. The only authority that can stop
the massive street fight, however, is China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
