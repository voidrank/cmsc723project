Anthony Tao from Beijing Cream blogs about Chinese netizensâ€™ reaction of the
Chinese government official news outlets, [Xinhua, being active on
Twitter](http://beijingcream.com/2012/12/xinhua-twitter-account-has-
infuriated-chinas-netizens/), an social media platform which is blocked in
China. As the blogger pointed out:

> it does seem slightly ironic for a government agency to be using Twitter
> when none of its people, technically, are allowed to. Twitter has been
> blocked by the Great Firewall since July 2009, and with recent upgrades to
> said firewall, several VPN services have been crippled as well.
