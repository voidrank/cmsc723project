Zheng Jinyan blogs her meeting with Dalai Lama in New Delhi. Dalai's message
is: [“only if the Chinese government agreed, I would return immediately. I had
no interest in politics, I am semi-retired in India. When I return to China, I
wouldn't intervene into politics, what I will do is to promote humanistic
value.”
