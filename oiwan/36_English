On China's heavily censored web, many web users depend on [Virtual Private
Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) (VPN) and
[proxy servers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) to access blocked
sites such as Facebook and YouTube. However, most of non-commercial proxy
access points are blocked once the Chinese government identifies their
existence. In fact, most of the public access points on Tor, part of a vast
volunteer network that conceals a user's location, [are blocked in
China](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/427413/how-china-blocks-the-tor-
anonymity-network/).

Joining the fight against censorship is a new circumvention software called
Lantern, which launched recently. Using peer-to-peer technology, the software
allows users to invite friends into a “trust network” and enables members of
the same network who have VPN or free Internet access to share their Internet
connection with their friends. This “trust network” makes it difficult for the
government to discover individual access points as the network is dispersed
and distributed. So far the majority of the users and traffic come from within
China.

The makers of the free software released a video to explain how the program
works, seen above.

Jian Alan Huang, a software engineer, shared the user information of the new
software with his friends in Twitter:

> [#Lantern](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Lantern&src=hash)
> 的用户数刚刚突破了10000，其中中国境内的用户7500人，占75%。从流量上看，中国流量占90%。因此，按比例估计，中国境外还有1500人左右是为中国用户提供流量的。除此之外的其他地区用户只有差不多1000人左右。

Alan is among one of the users providing network access to his friends in
mainland China:

Many users shared their review on the new tool. Editor of ChinaChange.org
Yaxue Cao reminded his friends that #Lantern cannot counter surveillance:

> 灯笼
> （Lantern）是一个为击败互联网审查而共同努力的世界人群网络。灯笼是同伴与同伴间绕开“围墙”的一种新软件。安装和分享这个新软件，从墙内获得被审查和阻挡的墙外信息。
> 灯笼旨在提供准入，无法保障你不受监控。反监控使用Tor. <http://t.co/hSrfFC1zZl>

@wenyunchao, a Chinese activist based in US, has some suggestions to make:

> 建议 [#Lantern](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Lantern&src=hash)
> 能有同时有提供连接和使用连接模式，墙外有很多用户想翻回中国看一些网络资源，如果能双向提供，相信可以吸引更多的墙外节点。同时建议能增加共享带宽设置，例如，我愿意分享30%的带宽给不是好友的用户。

@zuihulu and @MyDF explained why they chose Lantern as circumvention tool.
@zuihulu pointed out that the software icon of Lantern light is very symbolic:

>
> 试用了两天的Lantern，虽说稳定性和速度都不如我购买的收费VPN或SSH，但是在冬天上网的时候开着Lantern，看着电脑状态栏里面点着一盏灯笼（Lantern的图标），内心居然多了些许的温暖。

With the Great Firewall on Sina Weibo, the most popular microblogging website
in China, there is little discussion about the new software there. Ken Wang
[managed](http://weibo.com/1400499162/AkRF4ykIE) to introduce the new tool to
his friends by avoiding the use of sensitive words:

> 介绍一个全新的网络项目Lantern(灯笼)，这是Google
> Ideas资助的一个计划，旨在通过p2p信任网络实现突破xxx的努力。项目原理类似点对点下载，每一台安装了灯笼的解放区电脑都可以作为proxy帮助沦陷区电脑上网。灯笼的特色在于只有信任的朋友才能互相帮助，以保证proxy的安全

> Introduced a new Internet project called Lantern. It is a project sponsored
> by Google Ideas. It is an initiative to break through the XXX [Great
> Firewall deleted by Ken Wang to prevent censorship] by building a P2P
> trusted network. The mechanism is similar to
> [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent). Computers from a
> liberated area running the Lantern program can serve as proxy for computers
> from occupied area. To protect the safety of the proxy, users are only
> connected to their friends’ networks.
