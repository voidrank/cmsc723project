Recently [the Ministry of Education of PRC](http://www.moe.edu.cn) has
announced a list of [44 Han characters to be adjusted in their writing
style](http://bjyouth.ynet.com/article.jsp?oid=55318383). The adjustments were
so insignificant and redundant that most netizens criticized the ministry of
creating trouble. Even the Xinhua news described the adjustment as “plastic
surgery”.

However, the Ministry of Education's announcement has inspired many to create
new Han characters by themselves. And the new invention has reflected the
internet culture and netizens’ frustration in China.

Egaobaike has collected [three newly invented
characters](http://www.egaobaike.com/archives/chinese-2) from different
sources. The first one is pronounced as “Nan”. It is composed of two Han
characters: 腦殘, meaning brain damage.

It is a commonly used term in the Internet for criticizing patriotic youths
for their inability to think independently.

The second one is pronounced as “Wao” which is composed of 五毛, meaning [50
cents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party). It refers to the group of
commentators who are paid by the government or CCP to shape public opinion in
major websites and forums.

The last one is pronounced as “Diang”, which is composed of 黨中央 three words,
meaning the central committee of CCP. The new word refers to the absolute
political correctness that cannot be questioned.

It is quite obvious that the spoof is full of dark humor against the
domination of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In fact, some twitterers
reported that the third character “Diang”, which was invented yesterday, has
already been harmonized.
