Since April's [military
ouster](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/africa/sudan-omar-hassan-al-
bashir.html) of President Omar Al-Bashir after 30 years in power, [pro-
democracy protesters’ ](https://globalvoices.org/2019/06/12/sudans-democratic-
spring-is-turning-into-a-long-and-ugly-summer/)attempts to negotiate a
transition to civilian rule with Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC)
have faltered, stalled and then [broken
down](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sixty-dead-two-day-crackdown-sudan-
protesters-doctors).

On June 3, Sudan's [Rapid Support
Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces_\(Sudan\)) (RSF)
launched a brutal attack on peaceful protesters in Khartoum, the capital. The
RSF is made up of veteran militia members of the notorious
[“Janjaweed,”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/africa/sudan-leader-
hemeti.html?smid=tw-nytimesatwar&smtyp=cur) a paramilitary group operated by
the government under Bashir that carried out [genocide in Darfur.

facts/index.html)

The two-day crackdown in front of military headquarters in Khartoum left
[112](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sudan-names-100-killed-deadly-week)
people dead and more than
[700](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/sudan-troops-protesters-
attack-sit-in-rape-khartoum-doctors-report) injured. Among them were 12
children. Doctors say up to 70 people were
[raped](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/sudan-troops-protesters-
attack-sit-in-rape-khartoum-doctors-report) during the attack. The [dead were
thrown into the Nile](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/sudan-
death-toll-rises-to-60-after-khartoum-pro-democracy-sit-in) from the Blue Nile
Bridge during the night, according to multiple reports. Exact numbers are
difficult to verify due to a lack of cohesive cooperation with authorities.

Mohammad Mattar, 26, is just one of [many
protesters](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sudan-names-100-killed-deadly-
week) shot and killed by the RSF during the sit-in. He had traveled home to
Khartoum from London, where he had graduated as an engineer. [He was shot
while protecting two women during the
protests,](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/blueforsudan-social-media-
turning-blue-sudan-190613132528243.html) according to various reports
circulating on social media.

To cope with their grief, Mattar's friends began a [social media
campaign](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/blueforsudan-social-media-
turning-blue-sudan-190613132528243.html) asking people to change their profile
pictures to shades of blue in solidarity with protesters’ pro-democracy
struggle. They say Mattar's favorite color was blue and it was the color he
had on his profile pictures the day he died.

And a [“blue wave”](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-48647568/sudan-
friends-pay-tribute-to-victim-of-sudan-protests) has washed over social media
platforms. The color blue has come to symbolizes all who have lost their lives
during the uprising.

“Mattar was kind, caring … he had a white heart,” said one friend in a BBC
video on Mattar and the social media campaign. Abdullah Al Fazh said Mattar
was “the kind of person you only meet once in life.”

Mattar's friends changed their profile pictures blue simply to remember him,
but over the last few days, #BlueforSudan has become a globally trending
hashtag. Celebrities like Trevor Jackson and
[Rihanna](https://www.vibe.com/2019/06/rihanna-brings-awareness-sudan-
massacre) helped the hashtag trend worldwide.

One Twitter netizen recognizes that campaigns like these “won't save the
world” but that it will raise awareness and let the protesters in Sudan know
they're not alone:

further action:

### After trauma, protests resume

In the aftermath of the RSF attack, several military officers were arrested
and the TMC launched an investigation, [admitting wrong-
doing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/sudan-military-admits-
abuses-committed-in-khartoum-attack?CMP=share_btn_tw), according to The
Guardian:

> Sudan’s military rulers admitted that security forces had committed abuses
> during the attack on the camp. They appear to have been spontaneous as
> frustration grows after opposition leaders called off a general strike
> intended to force the generals to agree a transition to civilian rule.

But protesters are wary of the TMC's gestures of reconciliation to resume
talks, saying that trust with the TMC is broken after they [abused their
power](https://www.africanews.com/2019/06/13/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-
down-govt-sources/) in the June 3 dispersal. Instead, protesters have demanded
an [independent investigation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-
politics/distrust-between-sudanese-parties-makes-direct-talks-impossible-us-
official-idUSKCN1TF2D2) into the massacre.

Award-winning Sudanese filmmaker, Hajooj Kuka ([“Beats of the
Antonov”](https://www.pbs.org/pov/beatsoftheantonov/)), took part in the sit-
in and was also wounded. He says [“the reports of mass rapes are true and
consistent with what we have been seeing on the ground,” ](https://city-
press.news24.com/News/if-hes-not-dead-then-finish-him-off-20190608)to City
Press.

The TMC continues to hold onto power, with financial aid from Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates in the amount of [$3
billion.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/sudan-military-admits-
abuses-committed-in-khartoum-attack?CMP=share_btn_tw)

A [12-day internet
shutdown](https://www.internetsociety.org/news/statements/2019/turn-the-
internet-back-on-in-sudan-and-keep-it-on/) has made it difficult for the
[Sudanese Professionals
Association](https://www.sudaneseprofessionals.org/en/) (SPA) and other
protest coalition members to continue to organize protests on social media,
but protests in Khartoum and the city of Port Sudan continued as of Friday,
June 14, through word-of-mouth and SMS messages. These, too, have been met
with [ammunition and brute force](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sudan-crisis-
dictator-protests-blackout_n_5d03f7dbe4b0304a120f78e0).

The hashtag #IAmTheSudanRevolution, endorsed by the SPA — a leading voice in
the protests whose members have stood at the frontlines of negotiations — is
also trending:

[BBC's Africa editor, Fergal Keane,](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-
africa-48642546/sudan-protest-witnesses-saw-death-in-all-its-forms)
interviewed eyewitnesses who describe how the massacre had one aim: “to break
the revolution by traumatizing.”

The RSF's violence exhausted and nearly broke the spirit of protesters — which
makes the impact of social media campaigns such as #BlueForSudan particularly
important for building bridges between protesters and the rest of the world.
