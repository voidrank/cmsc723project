December 31, 2018, marked the end of an era in Japan as the country celebrated
the final New Year's Eve of Emperor Akihito's reign.

The Japanese emperor had announced in 2016 that he would abdicate the throne
on April 30, 2019, succeeded by his son Crown Prince Naruhito, bringing
Japan's 30-year [Heisei era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisei_period) to a
close. For Japanese people, 2018 was the year of _Heisei saigo (平成最後)_ , “the
last time we'll do this in the Heisei era” — especially year-end New Year's
events.

The Emperor made his final public address of 2018 on his birthday, December
23, where he reflected on his hopes for peace for Japan in the future. He also
remarked on the price Okinawa people continued to pay in 2018 for the
disastrous Pacific War that ended in defeat in 1945, a [common

“It gives me deep comfort that the Heisei Era is coming to an end, free of war
in Japan,” the Emperor
[said](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201812230011.html) in his remarks.

> It is important not to forget that countless lives were lost in the second
> world war and that the peace and prosperity of postwar Japan was built upon
> the numerous sacrifices and tireless efforts made by the Japanese people,
> and to pass on this history accurately to those born after the war.

Japan's Heisei era began on January 8, 1989, when Emperor Akihito was
officially enthroned [the day after the death of his
father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito#Death_and_state_funeral),
Emperor Hirohito, known posthumously in Japan as the Showa Emperor (昭和天皇).

Japan's Heisei era is known as a difficult yet peaceful time for the country.
The previous [Shōwa era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dwa_period)
witnessed a criminal regime that led Japan to complete defeat during World War
II after experiencing firebombings, atomic attacks, and mass starvation, all
followed an economic[
miracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_economic_miracle) and
prosperity after the war. In contrast, the Heisei era was peaceful, if
sometimes economically troubled following the [collapse of the 80's
Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_\(Japan\)) economy.

Imperial eras still play an important role in Japanese culture. While the
Gregorian calendar is used in Japan, most official documents such as bank
statements, utility bills and passports identify the year in terms of the
Imperial era. For example, 1989 is usually referred to as “Heisei 1″ in Japan,
while 2018 is referred to as “Heisei 30.”

To mark the bittersweet end of an era, the Twitter hashtag # _Heisei saigo
([#平成最後](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%B9%B3%E6%88%90%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C?src=hash),_
roughly, “the last time we'll do this in the Heisei era”, was used throughout
2018.

Earlier in the year the hashtag
[#平成最後の夏](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%E5%B9%B3%E6%88%90%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%8F%22&src=typd)
(the final Heisei summer) was fairly common on Twitter:

> 平成最後の夏に彼氏ができ、平成の次の時代まで交際を続けるのをやりたい。これを「時代を超へた愛」と云ふ。
>

> In my final summer of the Heisei era I got a boyfriend. I hope we can make
> the relationship last into the start of the next one. We'll call it ‘a love
> that transcends history.’

Toward the end of 2018, most people reflected on how December 31st would mark
the final New Year's Eve, one of the most important holidays of the year in
Japan — New Year's celebrations last from December 31 to January 3.

The country shuts down as families return to the family home from the bigger
cities to spend time with relatives. For many, the month of December means
frantic attempts to get ready for the holiday by cooking, cleaning and getting
everything squared away by December 31 to make a clean start to the New Year
on January 1.

As a result, in December the hashtag “last big clean of the Heisei era”
([#平成最後の大掃除](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%B9%B3%E6%88%90%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%A7%E6%8E%83%E9%99%A4?src=hash))
trended on Twitter:

> only 6 days this year.

New Year's Eve is known as _Omisoka_ (大みそか) in Japanese.
[Choukanne](https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/1261395/ja), the
official mascot of Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, explained the origins of the term:

> 皆さま、おはようございます。  
>  今日で2018年も終わり。平成最後の大みそかね。「みそか」はもともと漢字で「三十日」と書き、実際の日付に関係なく、月の終わりを意味するそうよ。

Once the cleaning and cooking are complete and relatives arrive, many families
spend New Year's Eve watching the [annual Red and White Song
Competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen) (紅白歌合戦),
known as the _Kohaku_. While the popularity of the program has waned in recent
years, the final Kohaku broadcast of the Heisei period persuaded stars such as
[Keisuke Kuwata](https://globalvoices.org/2015/01/05/japanese-singer-sports-
hitler-moustache-in-new-years-political-statement/), frontman of Boomer-era
mega group Southern All Stars, who normally holds his own New Year's Eve
concert in Yokohama, to appear on the show.

The final Kohaku program of the Heisei era seems to have rung out 2018 in
