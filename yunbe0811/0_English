Echo of Moscow in Yaroslavl, a local affiliate of [Echo of
Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_of_Moscow), Russia’s oldest
independent radio network, cancelled an interview with LGBT activists after
receiving homophobic threats, the station’s editor Lyudmila Shabuyeva
[said](https://www.facebook.com/ludmila.shabueva/posts/2483880188348851) in a
Facebook post:

> Вчера поступили угрозы в адрес наших сегодняшних гостей и нас, если мы
> проведем эфир на тему ЛГБТ.
>
> Я отменяю эфир.

> Yesterday we received threats against our guests and ourselves if we proceed
> with our talk show about LGBT.  
>  I’m cancelling the show.

[According](https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2019/01/23/148594-eho-moskvy-v-
yaroslavle-otmenilo-efir-s-lgbt-aktivistami-posle-ugroz) to independent
newspaper Novaya Gazeta, the show featuring Yaroslavl’s LGBT activists was
scheduled to air in the early morning of Wednesday, January 23. The same
activists had recently picketed the town’s main square to protest against the
persecution of gay people in Russia, notably in the republic of Chechnya. The
station invited them to be interviewed about the protest and their experience
of being openly gay in provincial Russia.

Shabuyeva’s initial announcement of the show attracted a torrent of homophobic
abuse in the comments, including some from local officials, but that didn’t
put her off, she told Novaya Gazeta. However, late in the night before the
show, Shabuyeva says, a stranger called her on the phone from an unidentified
number and told her that if she were to proceed with the scheduled
programming, her guests would be met outside the studio with baseball bats.
She could also face problems, the anonymous caller threatened. Fearing for her
guests’ safety, Shabuyeva cancelled the show and replaced it with another
programming.

The picket on Yaroslavl’s main square was part of a national campaign
#saveLGBTinRussia aimed at raising awareness about the brutal persecution of
gay people in the republic of Chechnya. Similar pickets and rallies were held
in other Russian cities.

In April 2017, Novaya Gazeta reported that the authorities of Chechnya, a
troubled Muslim republic in the south of Russia ruled by a former warlord
Ramzan Kadyrov, was waging a [brutal
campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gay_purges_in_Chechnya) of
repressions against its LGBT population. Recent
[reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/chechnya-two-dead-and-
dozens-held-in-lgbt-purge-reports) said the “purge” has been intensifying,
with at least two victims dead and dozens held in illegal detention.
