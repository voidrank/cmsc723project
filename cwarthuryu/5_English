On October 31, 2016, after a 2.5-year power vacuum, the Lebanese parliament
finally elected a president of the republic: Michel Aoun.

Aoun, a 81-year-old former army commander known by his supporters as “The
General,” is the founder of the [Free Patriotic
Movement](http://www.tayyar.org/) (FPM) and leader of the Change and Reform
Bloc. He [managed](https://moulahazat.com/2016/10/31/how-michel-aoun-became-
the-president/) to get 84 votes in the first round (86 votes were required)
and 83 votes in the second round (18 more than the 65 votes needed for a
simple majority), making him Lebanon's 13th president. Besides giving the
country an elected leader, Aoun's success is that he will return tothe
Presidential Palace after [he was forced out, by Syrian
troops,](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/31/world/middleeast/ap-ml-
lebanon-profile-michel-aoun.html?_r=0) as interim prime minister in October
1990. Until 2005, he lived in exile in France.

Celebrations, mostly by FPM supporters, broke out in many parts of the
country. Lebanese journalist and blogger at Beirut Syndrome [Kareem
Chehayeb](https://twitter.com/chehayebk) filmed one party in Beirut:

As is custom in Lebanon, many see Aoun's win in both geopolitical and
sectarian terms. More specifically, critics and analysts say his election is a
victory for Iran, due to the fact that Aoun was
[allied](http://www.english.alahednews.com.lb/essaydetailsf.php?eid=4442&fid=25)
Hezbollah's choice and that a major obstacle to his presidency was the
opposition of Saudi-backed leader Saad Hariri. In fact, the Iranian
government, which holds significant influence over Hezbollah, immediately
praised Aoun's election, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei even
[called it](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/11/iran-reaction-
lebanon-presidential-election-michel-aoun.html#ixzz4OrIt2AJc) “the triumph of
the Resistance Axis.” Bashar Al Assad [wasted no
time](https://www.yahoo.com/news/syrias-assad-congratulates-lebanons-
president-192456726.html) to call Aoun and congratulate him.

In contrast, Hariri, who ended up endorsing Aoun and securing the latter's
majority, called it a “[big
sacrifice](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-
east/2016/10/25/OPINION-Behind-the-Hariri-Aoun-bargain.html).” Hariri
endorsing Aoun was a surprise to the former's followers, many of whom still
oppose the move. Given that [he is now going to be prime
minister](https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-
News/2016/Nov-02/379308-saad-hariri-secures-parliamentary-majority-to-be-
named-lebanons-new-prime-minister-designate.ashx), again, it seems clear that
Hariri made the required political calculations to maintain some influence. As
the Washington Bureau Chief for Al-Hayat Newspaper Joyce Karam
[wrote](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-
east/2016/10/25/OPINION-Behind-the-Hariri-Aoun-bargain.html), “the Aoun-Hariri
deal is a pact for power and survival by both leaders and a statement of the
shifting realpolitik alliances in Lebanon.”

Karam also [explains](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-
east/2016/10/25/OPINION-Behind-the-Hariri-Aoun-bargain.html) how Hariri is
being challenged “from within” his traditional base:

> Minister of justice Ashraf Rifi has delivered a significant blow to Hariri
> in Tripoli and is emerging as a potential rival in garnering both local and
> regional support. Coming on the heels of a Saudi shift away from Lebanon
> toward Yemen, Syria, and in some cases Africa, the former prime minister was
> left with few options. Accepting Aoun was the most immediate vehicle to ease
> Hariri’s woes and secure even temporarily his political future.

But that is not necessarily how most people on the ground view the situation.
While there are no sociological surveys to establish scientifically what
people believe, anecdotal evidence suggests that Lebanese Christians generally
favored Aoun, particularly after the endorsement of his former enemy Samir
Geagea of the [Lebanese Forces](http://www.lebanese-forces.com/).

Lebanese journalist for the Wall Street Journal [Maria Abi-
Habib](https://twitter.com/Abihabib/status/793136125057662976) said the
election of Aoun should be seen as “a win for an overwhelming majority of
Christians who support him” rather than the result of geopolitical
calculations. The “Christian vote” often takes center stage in political
analysis as the position of president of the republic is a seat reserved
exclusively to a Christian Maronite, part of Lebanon's so-called Confessional
System, which aims, not without its fair share of criticism, to maintain a
“balance” between Lebanon's numerous sects.

As for how we got here, Lebanese blogger Ramez Dagher, who writes at
Moulahazat, authored an article titled “[How Michel Aoun Became the
President](https://moulahazat.com/2016/10/31/how-michel-aoun-became-the-
president/)” on October 31. In about 5,000 words, he summarized the two dozen
political commentaries he's written over the past three years. In those texts,
he argues that alliances in Lebanon are nothing but [temporary
phenomena](https://hummusforthought.com/2013/11/17/edward-said-on-lebanon/)
depending on regional trends and internal discord.

It's important to note that no elections have been held in Lebanon since 2009,
meaning that the parliament that chose Aoun to serve as president is
illegitimate, technically speaking. As Dagher explains:

> There is nothing democratic about the 2016 Lebanese presidential election.
> The president will stay till 2022, and was elected by the parliament of
> 2009. Everyone who wasn’t 21 at the time didn’t participate in the electoral
> process, and that means that anyone aged 33 or less would have had no say
> about who rules from Baabda Palace in 2022. And even those who indirectly
> elected the president by electing in 2009 the parliament that chose him,
> they picked their representatives in a completely different context: They
> voted for one of two coalitions that were completely different at the time,
> in a completely different regional and local context: There was no Syrian
> Civil War at the time, no Arab Spring, no ISIS. Hezbollah was still fighting
> Israel, not fighting Israel and in Syria. March 8 and March 14 had only
> tried to rule together once, between 2008 and 2009, not three times
> (2008-2009, 2009-2011, 2014-2016). There was no trash crisis, no garbage
> protests, no alternative political group back then. Moreover, you can’t deny
> quorum until the parliament elects you, and then come back to say your
> election was democratic. Especially if the current parliament that elected
> you as president is unconstitutional in the first place (and I’m quoting the
> constitutional council here)

Shortly before the elections, [a video of
Aoun](https://www.facebook.com/tol3etre7etkom/videos/1823126724616107/)
started circulating on social media showing him saying just that: the
parliament is illegitimate and therefore cannot elect a president. He said it
during a news conference on July 7, 2015, and repeated it in [March
2016](http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/204555).

This video was uploaded by [the “You Stink”
Movement](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2015-special-
coverage/lebanons-you-stink-protests/), which led protests against the “trash
crisis” and corruption in the summer of 2015. On Facebook, the group used the
hashtag “#كلن_يعني_كلن” (“All Means All,” and “They are all corrupt”), a
popular chant repeated during the protests.

#### The Election-Day Circus

Angry Lebanese mocked the elections online, widely describing the process as a
circus. A notable source of laughter was how House Speaker Nabih Berri, during
the election, was repeatedly forced to tell lawmakers to return to their
seats, at one point complaining that members of parliament were behaving like
“a school of hooligans.”

[One Twitter user](https://twitter.com/Mshaal80) shared a video produced by
Lebanese news station Al Jadid, showing members of parliament joking and
laughing amid the chaos. The Arabic branch of AJ+
[shared](https://www.facebook.com/ajplusarabi/videos/1215469425163267/) a
similar video.

One lawmaker, [Walid Joumblatt](https://twitter.com/walidjoumblatt), who heads
the mostly Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and is known publicly for
his rather eccentric tweeting habits, was on Twitter throughout the session,
uploading images of Ancient Rome:

Two of the votes cast were also the source of [a number of
jokes](http://www.beirutsyndrome.com/symptoms/humor-at-its-darkest-the-
lebanese-presidential-elections/). One MP voted for fictional character “Zorba
the Greek,” while another voted for Lebanese singer and model Myriam Klink
(who is a supporter of Michel Aoun).

And as Nadine Mazloum of Newsroom Nomad
[noted](https://newsroomnomad.com/aouns-election-ageism-sexism-unruly-
parliament/), the election was riddled with corruption even before it started:

> Two MPs should not have been allowed into Parliament, but alas, for the sake
> of consensus, they were.
>
> The first is Issam Sawaya, who reportedly left Lebanon shortly after his
> election in 2009, only to return for the Presidential bid. The second is the
> highly controversial [Okab Sakr](http://world.time.com/2012/09/18/syrias-

With this rocky start for Aoun's presidency, only time will tell what comes
next for Lebanon.
