President Yahya Jammeh of The Gambia has rejected the results of [the 1
December presidential elections](https://globalvoices.org/2016/12/05/gambia-
shocks-the-world-with-peaceful-presidential-polls-opposition-wins/) in the
tiny West African nation, which he lost to opposition coalition leader Adama
Barrow. In a televised address, Jammeh criticised the electoral commission and
proposed fresh elections to be organised by “God-fearing” people.

Jammeh previously had conceded defeat and promised a smooth transfer of power,
describing Gambia's electoral system as “rig-proof” and transparent, and
adding that the opposition victory was a “clear victory”. The Chief of Defence
Staff (head of the army) pledged allegiance to the president-elect after
Jammeh did so.

However, Jammeh's rejection of the results came barely 24 hours after he
promoted 49 junior officers of the Gambia Armed Forces. There were unconfirmed
reports that some senior members of the army exerted pressure on Jammeh to
concede defeat.

Here is a video of Jammeh rejecting the results.

Following his announcement on national television, Gambians took to social
media to protest Jammeh's decision.

Sait Matty Jaw criticised Jammeh's move, saying that he risks the peace and
stability of the country:

> The defeated dictator in Gambia has rejected the rigged prof elections that
> he organised at lost. Now putting The Gambia at a very critical position. As
> Gambians we spoke loud and clear that we no longer need the services of
> Jammeh. His current move has put the tiny country that have been non for its
> stable nature into a dire situation that needs immediate global attention.
> Jammeh lost hand down in a system he has created and now is putting the
> lives of citizens at risk.

Kemo Cham [warned](https://www.facebook.com/kemoc1/posts/10157988479030352)
that anyone supporting Jammeh's rejection of the results maybe guilty of
treason:

> Anyone, including members of the Gambian army, who supports this man, is
> equally guilty of treason.  
>  Even the person who wrote that speech. I know he is not intelligent enough
> to speak such good English. This moron!

Jammeh's decision: “By this, it's Crystal Clear that he want to get us to war.
Our last hope presently is the members of our

Jeffrey Smith tweeted a call of action to regional leaders in the African
Union and the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS):

Madi Jobarteh, a human rights activist,
[noted](https://www.facebook.com/Kalajula/posts/10154411768529355) that
Jammeh's decision is not in line with Gambian law.

> The announcement by Pres. Yaya Jammeh to reject the December 1 presidential
> election has no basis in law. It is unconstitutional and an affront on our
> national sovereignty and dignity.
>
> The election was conducted 9 days ago. The results were validated by the
> representatives of all the parties including [Jammeh's party] APRC in each
> and every counting center in the country. The results were announced by the
> Chairman of the [Independent Election Commission] who declared Adama Barrow
> the elected President of the Republic of the Gambia on national television.
> On December 2 Yaya Jammeh conceded defeat and called to congratulate the
> president-elect Adama Barrow on national television.

Dr Isatou Touray, who withdrew her candidature to support the opposition
coalition flagbearer Adama Barrow, tweeted:

> President Jammeh's rejection of the election results is a rape against

In the meantime, there is heavy military installations across the capital with
security checkpoints mounted in strategic locations. Jammeh said he has vowed
to crush any public demonstrations and urged everyone to go about their
regular business until fresh elections are held.

condemned](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gambia-election-senegal-

reports, he has reportedly summoned a United Nation Security Council meeting
on the situation and has notified regional organisations such ECOWAS and the
African Union.
