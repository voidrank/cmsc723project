few days after the victory of the opposition party. He is expected to assume a
big role in the new government headed by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

Civil society groups are urging Malaysia’s new government to uphold its
election campaign pledge of enacting reforms in governance which include the
abolition of laws that undermine free speech.

On May 9, 2018, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) party
[defeated](https://globalvoices.org/2018/05/12/a-new-era-for-malaysia-after-
voters-end-six-decade-reign-of-ruling-party/) Barisan Nasional (BN) which has
dominated Malaysian politics over the past 60 years. BN’s defeat was
attributed to the people’s clamor for a change in leadership after former
Prime Minister Najib Razak was implicated in several corruption scandals. The
Najib government was also accused of using repressive laws to detain
opposition leaders, intimidate critics, and censor the media.

During the campaign period, PH released a [manifesto](https://aliran.com/web-
specials/another-look-at-the-pakatan-harapan-manifesto/) which listed some of
the immediate reforms it will implement if it succeeds in the polls such as
the establishment of a media council made up of media leaders and the revision
of all draconian laws.

Now that PH is the head of the new government, various civil society groups
are reminding it to fulfill its commitment to reverse the oppressive laws,
policies, and programs existing under the previous ruling party.

Amnesty International reiterated its proposed human rights
[agenda,](http://www.amnesty.my/press-statement-malaysia-opportunity-for-new-
government-to-put-human-rights-at-the-forefront-of-reformation/) which
includes:

> …rights to freedom of expression and association, better protections for
> refugees and people seeking asylum, respecting the rights of Indigenous
> Peoples, protecting LGBTI individuals, abolishing the death penalty and
> ending the persecution of human rights defenders.

The Lawyers for Liberty [asked](http://www.lawyersforliberty.org/lfl-mcmc-
must-unblock-all-websites-previously-restricted-due-to-political-motivation/)
the new government to unblock the websites and blogs blocked by the Malaysian
Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). These websites were blocked
by MCMC for reporting about the corruption cases of Najib.

It also joined other groups in calling for the immediate repeal of
[laws](http://www.lawyersforliberty.org/lfl-pakatan-harapans-watershed-
victory-must-be-followed-by-institutional-and-human-rights-reform/) that were
often used by authorities to attack human rights advocates and critics of the
government such as the Sedition Act 1948, Prevention of Crime Act 1959,
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015, Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, and
the [recently passed](https://globalvoices.org/2018/04/06/with-elections-
approaching-and-parliament-dissolved-will-malaysias-anti-fake-news-law-become-
a-political-weapon/) Anti-Fake News Act 2018.

So far, the initial response of the new government has been welcomed by many
people.

First, it worked for the
[release](https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/370072/anwar-ibrahim-
walks-free-says-wont-join-cabinet-any-time-soon-nsttv) of former opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim who had been under hospital arrest on politically
motivated charges of corruption and sodomy.

The PH-led government also
[formed](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/21/committee-on-
institutional-reforms-accepting-complaints-from-people-groups/) a Committee on
Institutional Reforms to accept proposals on reforming the bureaucracy.

Some news websites were also
[unblocked](https://www.facebook.com/sarawakreport/posts/2150647784962013) on
May 17 such as the Sarawak Report and Medium.

The travel ban on political cartoonist and activist Zunar, a fierce critic of
Najib, was also
[lifted](https://twitter.com/zunarkartunis/status/995862840698286080) on May
14.

The new home minister also affirmed that the government will quickly review
controversial laws like the Sedition Act.

> New Home Minister Muhyiddin Yassin says his ministry will review laws such
> as the Sedition Act in consultation with activists etc, look at border
> security, defend the sovereignty of Sabah and Sarawak, resolve stateless
> Indian issues, talk to UNHCR about Rohingya issues.

But a statement by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that the government will
amend the anti-Fake News law by providing a clear definition of what
constitutes fake news has alarmed civil society organizations because PH has
earlier vowed to abolish the law.

The Sarawak Report [explained](http://www.sarawakreport.org/talkback/fake-
news-laws-and-democracy-dont-mix/) why the entire law must be scrapped:

> Journalists and citizens must be allowed speak freely and even be allowed to
> get it wrong, if they can show their intentions were to inform about
> something they genuinely had good reason to believe and are willing to
> correct and amend if found mistaken (as opposed to intended and malicious
> lies). These are the principles that have now evolved after much pain and
> argument in most modern democracies and Malaysia would do well to join them.

Around 20 civil society organizations
[signed](https://www.suaram.net/2018/05/22/malaysia-civil-society-calls-on-
new-government-to-reform-laws-restricting-freedom-of-expression-and-access-to-
information/#more-8765) a statement expressing disappointment over the “mixed
messages from the ruling coalition on the repeal of the Anti-Fake News Act.”
They proposed an alternative:

> We believe that the more effective solution to any disinformation and
> misinformation is the enactment of a Freedom of Information Act at the
> federal level.

They also reminded PH that legislative reforms are not enough to undo what BN
has done to Malaysian bureaucracy:

> …legislative reform must go hand-in-hand with the restructuring of national
> institutions to ensure accountability, independence, and respect for human
> rights. Moreover, the new government must meaningfully engage civil society
> in a program of reform that is inclusive and participatory.

Human rights groups also criticized the police for arresting a man who
[“insulted”](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/17/man-arrested-
for-allegedly-insulting-dr-m-and-islam-on-facebook/) Prime Minister Mahathir
on Facebook. The police said they merely responded to a complaint lodged
against the suspect:

Veteran politician Lim Kit Siang
[asserted](https://blog.limkitsiang.com/2018/05/18/police-detain-man-who-
insulted-dr-m-is-old-malaysia-time-for-all-agencies-to-develop-new-malaysia-
mindset/) that this behavior of the police should change in the “new”
Malaysia:

> In the New Malaysia, police response must not depend of “who” lodges police
> reports, but “what” was in the police report, and actions where civil remedy
> is available should not be criminalised just because the subject-matter
> involves the Prime Minister or any Minister for that matter.

Mahathir said he also
[disagreed](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/18/dr-m-disagrees-
with-police-action-to-arrest-man-over-fb-insults/) with the action taken by
the police and said the parliament will prioritize the review of vague laws
that criminalize the mere criticism of public officials.

The Centre for Independent Journalism welcomed the statement of Mahathir with
regard to this incident and appealed for a moratorium on the use of repressive
laws that continue to have a chilling effect in society. The group also
[summarized](https://ifex.org/malaysia/2018/05/15/fake-news-act/) the
[challenge](https://www.seapa.org/malaysia-statement-cij-calls-for-upholding-
of-freedom-of-expression-both-online-and-offline/) posed by free speech
advocates to the new government:

> It is critical at this juncture for the Pakatan Harapan coalition government
> to commit to defending a vibrant space for public discussion as the nation
> is headed towards transformation, to enable greater public participation in
> this process. This include clearly and unequivocally defending the right to
> freedom of expression, whether offline or online.
