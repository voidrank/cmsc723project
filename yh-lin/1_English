Japanese candy maker [UHA Mikakuto](https://www.uha-
mikakuto.co.jp/english/pro/main.html) (UHA 味覚糖) put out a challenge to Japan's
community of scientists and engineers: design and launch a hybrid rocket
powered by candy.

The challenge was answered. Scientists and researchers from all over Japan
participated in the [Candy Rocket Project](http://www.uha-
mikakuto.co.jp/candyrocket/), embarking on a mission to launch a rocket.

UHA Mikakuto documented the results in a YouTube video:  
  

In the video, spectators describe how the project captured their imagination,
while the various academics and scientists from universities around Japan
explained why launching a candy-powered rocket was such a formidable task.

On March 7, after two tests the team managed to launch a [10 kilogram, 1.8
meter rocket](http://news.ameba.jp/20150306-743/) to an altitude of 248
meters.

The rocket was powered by 20 [Puccho soft candies](https://www.uha-
mikakuto.co.jp/english/pro/candy.html). According to participating scientists
who were interviewed on the [Candy Rocket Contest](http://www.uha-
mikakuto.co.jp/candyrocket/) website, the participating scientist figured out
a process for quickly dissolving the Puccho candies into a combustible gas,
which in turn powered the rocket.

Here's a commercial for Puccho candy, featuring members of popular “idol”
group [AKB48](http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/style/AJ201301110064):
