[Thailand under military
rule](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2006/09/20/thailand-coup-update/) day
one looks like a regular day here albeit there were fewer people on the
street.

![Mochit Station](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2006/09/pdscn6217.thumbnail.JPG)Banks and schools are closed,
and most of the offices too.

Internet and cellular connection are all fine. CNN and BBC broadcast were
blocked until this afternoon, but then [has been available
since](http://www.2bangkok.com/highemer.shtml).

After trying to figure out what is really going on in Bangkok, I decided to
look and see it for myself.

All malls and shopping are open. [Siam Paragon](http://www.siamparagon.co.th)
the newest and biggest Bangkok malls looks normal.
[MBK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBK_Center) the favorit shopping place for
tourists is open, although they are closing sooner than usual, citing a
possible curfew that might be enforced.

![Buses and Traffic](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2006/09/dscn6226.thumbnail.JPG)Public transportation are all
normal, buses, taxis, motorcycle taxi, the subway and sky train station
(Bangkok MRT) are all functioning as they suppose to with minimum sight of the
military personnel's.

Jewie on his blog _Lost in Translation_ posted [Happy Military
Coup](http://jewie.blogspot.com/2006/09/happy-military-coup.html) mentioning
how everyone seems to be happy.

Michelle on _Brit in Bangkok_ calling this an [Excellent News for
Thailand:](http://britinbangkok.blogspot.com/2006/09/looks-like-excellent-
news-for-thailand.html)

And _Metroblogging Bangkok_ [citing poll
result](http://bangkok.metblogs.com/archives/2006/09/poll_on_the_cou.phtml)
how people feels about this coup:

> According to a popular public opinion poll, the Dusit Poll [figures not
> exact as I couldn't here correctly]
>
> 83% the people approved the “peaceful” coup as a way to calm the political
> situation in Thailand.  
>  17% disapproved….

I continue my quest for tanks from Siam Area to Rachadamnoen Nok (Outer
Avenue) that is the center of government administration.

Most Government departments, U.N. and ESCAP organizations as well as [Ananta
Samakhom Throne Hall](http://www.parliament.go.th/files/mainpage.htm), the
parliament house are also situated on this road

As I arrived, I saw that there were no blockade anymore. The people were
crowding the tanks and Humvees, distributing roses and mostly trying to take
pictures together with the military personnel's.

There were celebration atmosphere in the air, where everybody like take part
of this special day.

describe the Thai people reaction of this coup as cool detachment. Other than
in the Rachadamnoen area, you can not tell that there is coup going on in the
country.

The temporary government [has
promised](http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014139.php)
that there will be a civil government in 2 weeks period and has come up with
new general election date to be held in October 2007  
Tomorrow (hopefully) will just be a regular day.
