How to describe twenty two-year old MSN Spaces blogger [Zeng
Jinyan](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20060725_2.htm)? A threat to national
security? An AIDS activist who brings support, joy and hope to countless AIDS
orphans? A [young wife](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=466)
[radicalized](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2006/03/23/china-hu-jia-
day-36/) after [her husband ](http://www.feng37.com/more.asp?id=333)was
kidnapped by the state [for over a
month](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/2006/03/21/china_detained/)? Patron
spokesblogger for otherwise voiceless victims of injustice within China's
social justice circles? [A post today

tells that the 13 year-old daughter of mainland human rights lawyer [Gao
Zhisheng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Zhisheng), following a recent
stretch of house arrest, has slipped away from the twenty cops guarding her
house.

Renowned liberal writer and blogger [Yu
Shicun](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20060704_1.htm) posted the following ode to
Zeng to his blog this week, lauding her bravery and actions against the
backdrop of silent acquiescence from the majority of China's public
intellectuals—a group in which Yu caustically includes himself—and the
sentence yesterday of blind female reproductive rights lawyer [Chen
Guangcheng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Guangcheng) to four years in
prison, about whom Zeng frequently writes:

[Jinyan](http://www.iht.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?query=Zeng
Jinyan&sort=swishrank), the Lady Saint of our Times

> 圣人之后执拗地从南方跑来  
>  一不小心感染了西伯利亚的风寒  
>  她被裹挟、咳嗽，读经救济  
>  最后她原地不动地皈依  
>  抚正自己的衣冠

The successor to saints stubbornly fled the South  
Wasn't careful and caught a Siberian cold  
Wrapped up, choked, she read the scriptures for relief  
In the end converted with fixed conviction  
Rightly held her clothes in place

> 代圣立言者们感动了自己  
>  话未说完随风舞蹈  
>  她孤苦无助地成全汉地的秘法  
>  牛鬼蛇神们嫉妒得发狂  
>  狂风卷扫看客如落叶

Wannabe would-be modern sages worked themselves up  
And not yet finished speaking, danced along with the wind  
Bitter, alone and unaided, she came into China's legacy  
Bull ghosts and snake gods frenzied with envy  
The squall blew onlookers away like falling leaves

> 多少人称赞她的美，劝她停步  
>  罪恶也偷袭她，求她改辙  
>  她说：我只是做一个人  
>  罪人审控无罪成为大地上的风景

How many people praise her beauty, would see her stop  
Villians bring sneak attacks against her, beg her to change her tune  
I'm only being human, she says  
When sinners accusing innocents has become part of the scenery

> 无数的汉语将她和我们隔离  
>  她看见艾滋病孩子的眼睛就赞美  
>  看见盲人的神性暗自落泪  
>  此刻，她拈花示众，笑如般若

How far removed she is from so much that is Chinese  
She sees AIDS orphans’ eyes and praises  
She sees a blind man's heroism and cries inside  
At this moment, she picks flowers for all to see, smiling knowingly

> 看客们远远地为十二月欢呼  
>  汉语的烈士！她只想过好日子  
>  中国女性的好日子  
>  努力学习英语  
>  没有用英语表达的事情  
>  很多人不知道它的发生

Onlookers welcome the day she meets personal tragedy  
Martyr of Chinese! She just wants a good life  
A good life for Chinese women  
Works hard to learn English  
Things not said in English  
Happen and many people don't even know
