Serbian forum dwellers are confused and terrified by the statements made by
the UN representative [Martti
Ahtisaari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martti_Ahtisaari), who is authorized
to tackle international negotiations to determine the final status of [Kosovo
and Metohia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) (K&M in further text).
During the set of negotiations held in Vienna on August 8, Ahtisaari announced
that Serbs would have to pay for Milosevic's politics implemented in the
province of K&M during his rule.

At _SerbianCafe.com_ forum (SRP), _Magare_
[refers](http://www2.serbiancafe.com/lat/diskusije/mesg/15/008647501.html?7)
to a previous set of negotiations that put an end to [NATO's bombing of
Serbia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War) in 1999. Ahtisaari's
mediation then led to an agreement signed in the Macedonian border town of
Kumanovo, which resulted in Serbian forces withdrawing from K&M and hundreds
of thousands of Serbian refugees fleeing the territory. It came as a surprise
to see such a biased diplomat involved again:

> Is Martti Ahtisaari the same person who showed Milosevic a table panel and
> told him – if you don't sign the Kumanovo agreement, Belgrade will be flat

_T_I_ adds:

After a spree of criticism on the account of the person appointed by the UN to
help resolve the conflict, bloggers argue about possible solutions for the K&M
status problem.

Croatian bloggers at _index.hr_ ,
[analyze](http://www.index.hr/forum/default.aspx?q=t&idf=5&idt=99807&p=3)
(HRV) letters of the late Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic to Vladimir
Putin, Tony Blair and George W. Bush, in which he was addressing the issue of
K&M. Just before he was assassinated in 2002, Djindjic warned that the
province was gliding towards independence. He was pleading for talks on the
problems that the province was facing to start as soon as possible. He
proposed that Kosovo needed to be divided in two parts. Here's [an
excerpt](http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/pregled_stampe.php?yyyy=2006&mm=08&dd=04&nav_id=206863)
(SRP) from these letters:

> I assume that the moment has come after three years of KFOR presence to
> think thoroughly about a long-term solution to this problem.
>
> De facto, [K&M] will not become formally independent. Pressure towards
> Belgrade and Pristina is expected to form some kind of confederation. This
> may look like an elegant solution, but it is actually like a bomb awaiting
> explosion.
>
> First, the fact that Serbia does not currently have formal influence in its
> province will be perceived as defeat by the Serbian public, and therefore
> defeat of its democratic, reform-oriented government.
>
> Second, keeping that kind of fictive union of [K&M] with Serbia will keep
> our country from achieving further integration with Europe because our
> efforts to join the EU will depend on market harmonization with the southern
> province, which would be impossible. These two scenarios will bust extremism
> and weaken Europe-oriented elements with a long-spree of negative
> consequences in Serbia and the whole region. This may even lead to possible
> events which may follow in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Macedonia.

_Backstreet_ agrees with the late Zoran Djindjic, noting that K&M has always
been an undeveloped region:

> K&M is a Serbian hole without a bottom in financial as well as any other
> aspect. Our future is much lighter without two million Albanians inhabiting
> part of our territory. It is true that Serbian myth-mania has significant
> influence in the issue dating as far back as the great battle against the
> Ottoman empire in 1389. On the other hand, nobody can achieve independence
> easily. If Albanians really want their own state, they would have to pay
> Serbia. So far, justice is on our side, as China and Russia announced that
> they would veto eventual independence of K&M in the UN Security Council if
> both Pristina and Belgrade don’t agree.

_Agron_ from Croatia doubts Russia would react in case K&M sovereignty is
forced:

> I read some articles online stating that Serbia is ready to give away K&M
> for a few billion dollars. In my opinion, I believe your politicians will
> gamble on that account. Russia is a great ally of Serbia? As I recall,
> Moscow didn’t halt the NATO bombing of your country. Russia has its burning
> troubles with a hundred different minorities, which means they may not be
> powerful enough to take care of the Serbian well-being.

_Vlastimir_ warns about the rights Albanian population would get if K&M
remains part of Serbia, meaning that Albanian high birth rate would be
financed by Serbs:

> The greatest degree of autonomy would include Albanian members of parliament
> and government ministers, as well as free flow of people and capital. For
> example, think of Albanians buying property in the south Morava region or,
> say, a peasant from Banat paying taxes to finance “sixth-child allowance”
> for an Albanian woman from Djakovica.

_Shogun79_ compares Serbian matters with the situation in Spain and, contrary
to Vlastimir, favors the greatest degree of autonomy:

> Is Catalonia, a county with its majority non-Spanish population, a main
> architect of progress in the modern Spanish nation today? Yes it is! I have
> spent a year there and that is my impression. The problem is pretty similar
> to the one in K&M. If Serbia offers the greatest degree of autonomy for K&M,
> it would become a fruitful base of return for over three hundred thousand
> Serbian refugees forced to run away in 1999, as well as other expatriates of
> the last sixty years or so. By the way, I would not mind seeing Albanians
> sitting in the Serbian parliament, as long as they all recognize Serbia as
> their own country. Of course, they would have all the rights as any citizen
> would, but they would also have to abide by the law.

Back at _SerbianCafe.com_ forum (SRP), concerned members of the internet
community write about what might happen [if Kosovo gets
sovereignty](http://www2.serbiancafe.com/lat/diskusije/mesg/15/008633363.html?46
).

_Serbianac_ gets emotional as he writes:

> Don't leave us Europe, America and Russia, as we are part of the same
> civilization and democratic world. We are on the verge of having our soul
> and body amputated, K&M taken from us!

_Bezier_ continues:

> We need patience to resolve this complex issue. Of course, it is important
> not to put a signature on any document. Even if some crazy politician does
> sign anything like K&M independence, the Serbian parliament has to ignore
> it!

_Rudnicki Soko_ thinks Albanians came out just:

> Why don't you face the reality? K&M has been a graveyard for our nation for
> centuries now. Since I have known about it, Serbs were selling their estates
> and fleeing out of the land. To be honest, Albanians did pay all of them
> with a fair amount of convertible currency.

Revolted by _Rudnicki Soko_ ’s opinion, _Olja_ states:

> You say that Serbs sold their property in K&M. You may be right. What would
> you do if there is daily fret about your child possibly being killed, raped
> or burned alive? For example, my late father did not sell any piece of his
> property. But then, someone came to his estate robbing and destroying my
> home. So who do we turn to? The government, America or the European Union?

Another related topic [opens

new information coming in apparently from a journalist nicknamed _TOSHIBA_ :

> During an event held in Kragujevac, Ljubinko Todorovic, deputy ombudsman for

>
> I got another interesting avowal miraculously refused to be published by any
