[Anna Politkovskaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politkovskaya), a Russian
journalist famous for her critical coverage of Chechnya and Vladimir Putin's
policies, was shot to death in Moscow Saturday. Russian-language blogs are
awash in speculation on who might be behind the murder.

[points](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/800844.html) (RUS) at [Ramzan
Kadyrov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramzan_Kadyrov), Chechnya's prime
minister, without naming him; the Russian [Yandex
Blogs](http://blogs.yandex.ru/) portal currently lists this post as the third
most popular one in the Russian blogosphere:

> I'll cite them here, for the public record.

> Fact number one. While Chechnya's prime minister [[Sergei
> Abramov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Abramov)] was closely working
> on investigating the issue of who, how and where extorts money in Chechnya
> for “rebuilding the republic,” he kept getting attacked. The last attack – a
> car crash – was the fifth one, if I remember correctly. And the most
> successful one. Abramov was out of the game.
>
> Fact number two: An hour and a half before her death, Anna Politkovskaya
> told about her latest investigations in an interview to the [Caucasus
> Knot](http://kavkaz.memo.ru/). She was investigating – surprise! – [the same
> mechanisms of money
> extortion](http://kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/news/id/1071680.html), corruption
> and stealing of state funds that Abramov had been looking for in his time
> (and, to his misfortune, kept finding). Politkovskaya had the misfortune to
> declare publicly that she had the documents at her disposal that would allow
> her to recreate the whole corrupted scheme of financing the “Chechen
> national projects.” The journalist's fate was decided.
>
> Fact number three: of course, if there had only been an interview with the
> Caucasus Knot, Politkovskaya would have been alive now. Unfortunately,
> somewhat earlier, she managed to tell about it in an interview with Radio
> Liberty. And it's likely that the people whose plans could've been disrupted
> by her investigation had their own sources of information, which allowed
> them to know the current interests and creative plans of the deceased.
>
> What has to be noted is the […] recklessness that accompanied the
> contractor's decision to tie the [long-awaited “fact of
> liquidation”](http://lj.rossia.org/users/lawal/139172.html) to the happy
> state holiday [Vladimir Putin's birthday]. I have no doubts he'll be allowed
> to get away with Politkovskaya, just as his father was forgiven for the
> jihad he had declared against Russia. Because there are plenty of false
> directions in which the investigation could be diverted. […] As for the
> actual hit man, I think the casting for the role of his corpse has already
> begun in the morgues of Chechnya's hospitals.
