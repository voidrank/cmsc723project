One of South Korea's most outspoken actresses has claimed that two networks
cancelled her TV appearances after a candidate she openly supported lost in
the recent[ presidential
elections.](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/12/20/former-dictators-

for her progressive views and active political participation
([@yohjini](https://twitter.com/yohjini)) [disclosed [ko]
](https://twitter.com/yohjini/status/287039158596288512)via Twitter on January
3, 2013 that two TV networks who had booked her for their shows suddenly
cancelled her TV appearances due to her political orientation. She regularly
participates in protests and recently endorsed [Moon Jae-
in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Jae-in), the left-leaning candidate who
lost the election.

> 각 방송사 윗분들, 문재인캠프에 연관있었던 사람들 출연금지 방침같은 건 좀 제대로 공유를 하시던가요. 작가나 피디는 섭외를 하고 하겠다고
> 대답하고 나서 다시 “죄송합니다 안된대요” […]

> All the heads of the broadcasting stations. You better share with your
> people the internal rules regarding preventing Moon's campaign supporters
> from appearing on TV. A producer and writer of the show already booked me,
> but they contacted me later to say “I am sorry. This can't be done”

The tweet has since been re-tweeted 1500 times, igniting strong public
criticisms toward broadcasting stations. To many observers, the incident once
again confirms the open secret that internal guidelines at TV stations exist
to screen out political minorities or critics of powerful politicians.

With some raising doubts that her denied TV appearance may have been just
coincidental, Kim
[clarified](https://twitter.com/yohjini/status/287233162185158656 ) [ko]:

> […] 굳이 그렇게 꼭 집어 말씀하시던데요. 그 전에도 여러번 당했던일이지만 꼭 집어 그렇게 듣는 건 처음이었어요. “문재인캠프
> 연관된분이라 안괸다고 하네요. 죄송합니다.”라고 들었습니다.

> They made it very clear. I’ve had that treatment several times before but it
> was the first time they specified the reason. I was told “since you are
> connected to Moon's campaign, you cannot (be on the show). I am sorry”.

Kim [added bitterly](https://twitter.com/yohjini/status/287040873496182785)
[ko] ‘I expected this to happen’.

Opponents to this point of view, such as [@pyein2](http://twitter.com/pyein2)
[argue](http://twitter.com/pyein2/status/288319122138337280) [ko] that the
cancelled TV appearance may simply have been the result of Kim's failure to
generate hit movies, and her attempts to build a reputation through political
activities rather than acting. However, a Tistory blogger
[stressed](http://ing45.tistory.com/236) [ko] that it is still inexcusable:

> 자신이 애국보수라고 주장하는, 대한민국의 자칭 보수는 이 상황이 당연하단다. 왜? 나랑 다른편에 섯다고. 그래서 그냥 나와 다른편이기
> 때문에 밥줄이 끊기는건 당연하다고 이야기 한다. 왜 이게 당연한건가? […] 나는 우리집에서 내는 TV수신료 내고 싶지 않다.

One local newspaper [believes
that](http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/show.asp?idx=2370316) [ko] although there is
no written blacklist on paper, TV executives may hint to concerned producers
that it is better not to employ controversial actors or politically vocal
broadcasters on their shows.
