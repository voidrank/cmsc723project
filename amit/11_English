ONO the Robot

Online security is a complex issue that is sometimes hard to understand or to
know how to face. Using a lovable animated robot, the [Tactical Tech
Collective](https://onorobot.org/ "Ono Robot by the Tactical Tech Collective")
is trying to get more people aware on how to stay safe online through short
video animations that can be viewed online or downloaded.

With eight new weekly releases for their new series Survival in the Digital
Age, ONO the robot will help us with email security, facebook security,
private browsing and more. The first video in the new series is [_HEY YAHOO!
HTTPS MY EMAILS!_](https://onorobot.org/en/clip_1 "ONO robot clip 1") where
how to chose a safe web based email provider. The organization is using
crowdsourcing efforts to [translate the videos](https://onorobot.org/languages
"translate ono robot") into as many languages as possible.

In 2010, ONO made its appearance explaining the [Digital Traces we leave
behind](https://onorobot.org/en/episode_1 "Ono robot digital traces video")
and how to keep our personal information and contacts safe when using mobile
devices, cameras or the internet. The videos in this past series have been
subtitled into many different languages already. Following is the promotional
video for this episode, the full length video can be viewed at

Behind Ono robot")

> Through ONO's own eyes, we see how we are constantly tracked through our
> digital communications. While a lot of the time this might not be harmful
> for us, we have little control over what we want to keep private and what is
> available for viewing, recording and information harvesting. This is crucial
> for activists and journalists who might be under surveillance and whose
> digital activities can put them in danger. [ONO explores
> ](https://onorobot.org/en/episode_5 "Ono online security video")some of the
> ways that people can protect their identity and separate who they are from
> what they are doing such as: the use of anonymising and circumvention tools
> and encryption. ONO warns us that we need to know what we are doing when
> trying more advanced privacy techniques and provides a checklist for the
> best practises which everyone can implement in our daily use of email,
> mobile phones and online services.
