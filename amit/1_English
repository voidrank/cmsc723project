These days, you don't see much idealism or activism among Thailand's youth—not
since a [coup](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/26/10-things-you-need-
to-know-about-the-coup-and-crisis-in-thailand/) last May led to the imposition
of martial law. Now that the government has banned public gatherings of five
people or more, it's become extremely difficult for young people to get
involved in social movements. Criticizing army officials or trying to organize
protest actions against the state, many fear, might even put activists in
danger.

But not everyone in Thailand remains silent. 17-year-old Nattanan
Warintarawet, more commonly known as “Nice”, has dared to speak up publicly,
challenging the new military-backed government. Warintarawet has criticized
the authorities in multiple areas, including academic freedom and youth
politics. She has also challenged the state on sociopolitical issues ranging
from the justice system to participatory democracy to fundamental human
rights.

As Secretary General of the Education for Liberation of Siam (ELS), she
organized several activities that have already had a strong effect on Thai
society—an impressive achievement in a nation under martial law. Last month,
the ELS published an [open letter](http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/4423)
addressed to the prime minister and coup leader, [General Prayut Chan-o-
cha](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/26/coup-leader-prayuth-chan-ocha-
selected-thailand-new-prime-minister/). ELS seeks reforms for Thailand's
ailing education system, advocating an end to the country's top-down approach,
which currently excludes students from much of the bureaucracy's
decisionmaking.

> …the underlying philosophy of education that stresses authoritarianism and
> causes hindrance to the critical thinking of students still endures.
>
> We truly believe that the effective education reform must be based on a
> bottom-up or decentralized approach, not a top-down practice. Voices of
> students must be heard and taken into account.

ELS's open letter is partly a response to the junta's “education-reform
roadmap”, published earlier this year, which identifies General Prayut's 12
“core values” in education.

>   1. Love for the nation, religions and monarchy
>   2. Honesty, patience and good intentions for the public
>   3. Gratitude to parents, guardians and teachers
>   4. Perseverance in learning
>   5. Conservation of Thai culture
>   6. Morality and sharing with others
>   7. Correct understanding of democracy with the monarch as head of the
> state
>   8. Discipline and respect for the law and elders
>   9. Awareness in thinking and doing things, and following the guidance of
> His Majesty the King
>   10. Living by the sufficiency economy philosophy guided by His Majesty the
> King
>   11. Physical and mental strength against greed
>   12. Concern about the public and national good more than self-interest.

Earlier this month, ELS held a peaceful gathering in front of the Ministry of
Education. Their aim was to raise student awareness and assert their right to
debate the the policies and values that affect their lives. The Education
Minister Admiral Narong Pipatanasai unceremoniously [called their
actions](http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/4434) as abnormal.

Warintarawet told Global Voices that the rebuke by the education minister is a
restriction on academic freedom:

> We have to understand other people. We should respect others, based on
> humanistic values and not on those values of what the government said.
>
> Different beliefs are not the cause of conflict. Conflict is caused by the
> inability to not being able to express.

Warintarawet argues that students need to participate in policymaking, which
would in turn enable Thai youths to think for themselves. Like her peers, she
faces challenges from some nationalist groups, who prefer students to remain
obedient to the state. Warintarawet says she gets her determination from her
parents, who encourage her to stay dedicated to nonviolent activism.

> We have to accept (that) our country has flaws but extreme nationalism will
> prevent us from growing. My parents are supportive but my mother was
> initially worried. It took me 4 days to reassure her.

Warintarawet says stubborn commitment to outdated ideas is an obstacle to
critical thinking—a skill she worries is desperately needed among Thai youth
today. Warintarawet also believes government officials are monitoring her at
her school, where life has become uncomfortable, she says. The attention
amounts to “harassment,” in her own words.

> The school administration is keeping an eye on me.
>
> Many people like what I am doing but some don’t want to openly support me.
>
> They have their studies and some say that as a student I should not fight
> for rights.

ELS recently launched a [social media campaign](http://www.elsiam.org/) and an
[online
petition](https://www.change.org/p/%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81-%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%8C-%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%92%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A2-%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%8A%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A112%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3)
to promote academic reform and student rights awareness.
