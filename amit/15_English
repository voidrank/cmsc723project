Rome, the Eternal City, where myth becomes reality. Rome, where there is
always something new to discover.

Before becoming site of the Holy See, Rome was first a city, then a republic
and eventually an empire. Rome “was the most politically important, richest,
and largest city in the Western world” over a period of [almost seven hundred
years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). At the height of its power, the
Roman Empire spanned from Britain to the Arabic Peninsula, North Africa and
Eastern Europe.

On April 21, 2012, Romans celebrated the 2,765th anniversary of their city.
Legend says that the Rome was founded by Romulus, a demigod nurtured by a
wolf.

Website, Why Rome?, [explained](http://whyrome.blogspot.it/) the legend of the
so-called Eternal City:

> This Saturday, April 21st, Rome will celebrate its 2,765th birthday. (Can
> you imagine being around that many years?!) This is based on the legendary
> founding of Rome by Romulus in 753 BC. In case you're not familiar with the
> legend, here is a brief overview. Romulus and Remus were twins. Their
> mother, Rhea, was a Vestal Virgin, and their father was a god (Mars, the god
> of war). Before they were born, male descendants in the family were killed
> by their Grandfather's brother. When the twins were born, they were left to
> die. However, a she-wolf came along and nursed them. The boys grew up to
> become natural leaders. They decided to found a new city, but couldn't agree
> on the exact location. The two quarrelled, and Remus was killed in the end.
> Romulus then founded the new city on the Palatine Hill, and named it after
> himself … Rome.

Celebration of Rome's anniversary (author's photo)

These places are a testimony to the glory of [Ancient
Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"). The [Circus
Maximus](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/sights/archaeological-
site/circo-massimo), still accessible despite ongoing restructuring works, was
a theatre for all kinds of entertainments over 2,500 years ago, with a
capacity of [150 000
spectators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circo_Massimo#cite_note-0). To this
day, it is one of the largest stadiums built by mankind.

Architect [Tom Rankin](http://sustainablerome.wordpress.com/about/) of the
Sustainable Rome blog linked the anniversary of Rome with Earth Day on April
22. He [asked](http://sustainablerome.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/bridging-the-
gap-between-cultural-heritage-and-environmental-sustainability/):

> While it’s easy to associate cultural heritage with Rome and environmental
> sustainability with the Earth, I am interested in building bridges between
> these two fields both locally and globally since I see the city not as the
> source of our global environmental problems but as the solution…. Can Rome
> leverage its richly layered history to sustain itself economically and
> ecologically? Can it re-use the resources accrued over time to avoid excess
> consumption? I believe it can and teach a course called Ecological Urbanism
> which uses Rome as a Laboratory to address themes such as waste, energy,
> water, transportation and land use.
