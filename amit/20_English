On February 20, 2012, Colombia's ‘[official travel
guide](http://www.colombia.travel/en/)‘ will launch a platform where foreign
bloggers writing in Spanish, English, German, French, and Portuguese will
share their experiences living and traveling in Colombia. The site aims to
inspire travelers, investors and anyone interested in the country to discover
a side of Colombia that tends to get lost amidst negative press.

All participating bloggers are listed by language on the
[website](http://www.colombia.travel/en/new-official-bloggers), which links to
their personal blogs and a short profile. One of these bloggers is Kristin
Rads, a math teacher living in Cali who blogs in [Coffee, Calculations &
Colombia](http://www.coffeecalculationsandcolombia.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-
not-colombia-30-travel-bloggers.html). She provides some context in a post
about the project:

> Leading the charge in this is a company named
> [Proexport](http://www.proexport.com.co/). Since November 1992, Proexport
> has been in charge of promoting exports, foreign investments, and
> international tourism within Colombia – and for 2012, they are stepping up
> their game in a big way.
>
> Pairing up with 30 expatriate and/or travel bloggers, Proexport aims to
> provide potential tourists with a complete, updated look at a country with
> so much opportunity for growth in the tourism industry.

Blogger and Community Manager, Eloy Quiros, blogged about the first gathering
of the “official bloggers” held in Bogotá. He shares some photos [in his
blog](http://eloyhanoi.blogspot.com/2012/02/colombia-travel.html) [es].

Blogger and freelance journalist [Richard
McColl](http://www.richardmccoll.com/2012/02/07/we-are-official-bloggers-for-
colombia/) was also there:

Food blogger Diana Holguín from [Bogotá Eats +
Drinks](http://bogotaeatsanddrinks.com/2012/02/08/colombias-official-blogger-
program-takes-off/), who also attended the event, explains:

> 33 bloggers, yours truly included, will share their stories about
> **Colombia** with the world, through their eyes, ears and taste-buds,
> enticing tourists and investors alike to come and experience Colombia. […]
>
> Each blogger will be required to post at least twice a month and in exchange
> we’ll increase web traffic to our blog page and have the possibility of
> receiving invitations to special events and trips to some of **Colombia’s
> hottest destinations.**

José Luis Pastor and Marcela Mariscal from [See Colombia Travel
Blog](http://seecolombia.travel/blog/2012/02/colombia-travel-blog-proud-to-be-
official-bloggers-for-colombia-travel/) describe it as “a very international
affair”:

> with writers coming from Peru, Colombia, Spain, the US, the UK, Belgium,
> France and many more countries. Each blog or page also has a very different
> genesis – some are [hostels in
> Colombia](http://www.lacasaamarillamompos.com/), some are webpages about
> Colombia, some are blogs about Colombia, some are [travel agencies in
> Colombia.](http://seecolombia.travel/) All, however, have a united goal: to
> promote Colombia and encourage fellow travellers to explore this
> fascinating, diverse country.

Mike Ceaser also introduces the project in his blog [Mike's Bogotá
Blog.](http://mikesbogotablog.blogspot.com/2012/02/colombias-bloggers-
campaign.html) In his opinion it is:

> a **good, low-budget strategy for Colombia** , and something which would
> have been **near impossible just a few years ago** , when the news was
> dominated by bombings, kidnapping and narcotrafficking and the country was
> off limits to all but real thrill seekers. Certainly, Colombia still has
> problems, but those are now secondary to the nation's economic growth, its
> cultural diversity and its tremendous biodiversity.
