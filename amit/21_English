Tuktuk, Beca, Kuliglig, [Trishaw](http://www.travelwireasia.com/2562/in-
pictures-burmas-many-modes-of-transport/), Pedicab, Becak, Tricycle. These are
the famous three-wheeled vehicles common in the Southeast Asian region. They
can be seen in the streets of urban centers, but governments are trying to ban
these ubiquitous pedicabs and motorized rickshaws in major throughfares.

[E-Tuktuks](http://laovoices.com/e-tuktuk-in-europe/) whose spare parts were
made in Thailand will arrive in Europe soon. Meanwhile, E-Trikes were
[launched](http://newsbytes.ph/2011/04/13/mandaluyong-deploys-first-wave-of-e-
trikes/) last year in the Philippines. They use lithium ion batteries,
commonly used in laptop computers and mobile phones. Below is an E-Trike in
[Davao City](http://karlosmanlupig.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/e-trike/) in
southern Philippines which is being promoted to reduce use of fossil fuels:

[Jan Shim](http://shimworld.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/exploring-the-penang-
heritage-trails-on-a-trishaw/) rode a Beca or rickshaw when he toured Penang,
Malaysia:

> THERE are many ways to see Penang, and one of the more interesting manners
> would be on a trishaw. Also known locally as the beca or rickshaw, it is a
> quaint mode of transport that ferries passengers through the streets of
> Penang at a leisurely pace. In Malaysia, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were
> gradually replaced by cycle rickshaws (beca in Malay). Cycle rickshaws were
> ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanization has
> increased demand for more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling
> cycle rickshaw numbers. Today, cycle rickshaws are operated mostly as a
> tourist attraction, with small numbers operating in Malacca, Penang,
> Kelantan and Terengganu.

[M-Explorer](http://m-explorer.blogspot.com/2011/11/coolest-rickshaws-in-

motorcycle in the city of Siantar in Indonesia.
[Edwin](http://edwindwianto.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/pedicab-ride-it-while-

[Enchanting Eden](http://enchantingeden.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/beguiled-by-
becaks-the-fast-disappearing-ubiquitous-pedicabs-of-indonesia/) notes that
Becaks are being replaced by modern vehicles:

> Becaks are fast becoming a rare breed, as City Governments across the
> Archipelago ban them for their antiquated and inhumane nature, replacing
> them with motorized versions trikes similar to Thailand’s tuk -tuks. It’s
> ironic to think that while this is happening in Indonesia, the rest of the
> world, especially in the progressive countries who are pursuing anything
> labelled “green alternative everything” are re-introducing pedicabs in one
> form or another.
