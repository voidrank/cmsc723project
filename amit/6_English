#### Update 3 October 2012:

On Saturday 29 September 2012, 30,000 people took part in a Peace March along
Melbourne's Sydney Road, Brunswick where Jill Meagher was last seen alive.
After news of her death, numerous Facebook pages titled R.I.P. Jill Meagher
had sprung up.

One page had over 300,000 likes and [this
one](https://www.facebook.com/jillmeaghertribute) captured the moving scene:

Two legal issues have arisen. Police were in protracted negotiations with
Facebook over distasteful FB pages before they were finally taken down. There
were also concerns that they might [prejudice a fair
trial](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/we-will-never-forget-say-jill-
meaghers-family/story-e6frf7jo-1226487337000).

On a broader front, States Attorneys General are to discuss the legal
implications of social media and the law, with [calls for
restrictions](http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8542423/national-approach-
for-social-media-vic). Madeleine Ross at

networks-in-face-of-na), an advertising, marketing, media and PR website,
explored some of the issues:

#### 28 September 2012:

This week Melbourne has seen what is perhaps its biggest and its saddest
social media campaign following the disappearance and alleged rape and murder
of Jill Meagher. From [Meagher family, friends pay tribute to
Jill](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-28/jill-meagher-abc-family-friends-
tribute/4285564):

> Friends, colleagues and the public have taken to social media to leave
> tributes to ABC employee Jill Meagher.
>
> … Ms Meagher's husband Tom has thanked members of the public for their
> “humbling” support.

Jill was a staff member at the ABC Radio 774, part of the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation. She and her husband Tom came to Australia from
Ireland three years ago. After she went missing in the early hours of Saturday
22 September, a Facebook campaign [Help us find Jill
Meagher](https://www.facebook.com/HelpUsFindJillMeagher) attracted
extraordinary attention with 122,253 likes and 133,998 talking about this by
Friday 28.

Many tweets at [#jillmeagher](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23jillmeagher),
such as this one by [Mel Campbell](https://twitter.com/incrediblemelk), linked
to ‘missing’ posters:

Other Facebook pages such as [Missing Jill
Meagher](https://www.facebook.com/MissingJillMeagher) also sprang up. Some
sought help with identifying [CCTV
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiBck13rpcA) released by police. Most of
the visitors to these pages were trying to be helpful but there were the
inevitable trolls on Facebook sites and twitter. They do not bear repeating
here but[ ‘Can we please stop the victim
blaming?](http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/can-we-please-
stop-the-victim-blaming-20120925-26izn.html)‘ documents some of the ways in
which “self-fancying armchair detectives had already taken to social media to
share their uninformed, moronic theories on what might have happened”.

BBC foreign correspondent [Nick Bryant](https://twitter.com/NickBryantOz), who
has worked in Australia for several years, tweeted sentiments shared by most
Melburnians following news of her death:  
‏

The charging of the alleged killer has brought warnings about possible
unintended negative consequences of social media comment. Matthew Knott of
crikey.com [reported](http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/09/28/jill-meagher-case-
bolt-twitter-users-warned-on-comment/):

> The family and former colleagues of Jill Meagher have urged social media
> users not to publish prejudicial statements about the man charged with the
> rape and murder of the ABC employee because of fears they could impact on a
> future trial.

[Helen Dale](https://www.facebook.com/helen.dale.90) who blogs as
[Skepticlawyer](http://skepticlawyer.com.au/about/) posted to her Facebook:

> Please (wearing my lawyer's hat now) remember the following:

> 1\. The presumption of innocence, regardless of how strong the Crown case

>
> 2\. The matter is now sub judice. Do not speculate on it.

> 3\. If you see a Facebook page or online forum wishing death or
> dismemberment or prison rape on the accused, report it to Facebook or to the
> site owners.
>
> 4\. Go back to number (1).

These warning were backed up by the [Victoria
Police](https://twitter.com/VictoriaPolice) on Twitter:

Let’s hope that people take this advice.
