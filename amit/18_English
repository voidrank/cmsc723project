The documentary _Runa Kuti, Urban Natives_ shows us the stories of four
descendants of indigenous communities living in the city of Buenos Aires, and
how they struggle with reclaiming their identity, rediscovering their culture
and making a place for themselves in the city.

The film focuses on several descendants of indigenous groups who all live in
Buenos Aires. Through their stories they share how they were raised sheltered
from their own roots as their parents decided to shelter them from the
exclusion and discrimination by not teaching them their indigenous language or
customs, others grew up in ignorance of their ancestors origins, and how they
have decided to embrace their tradition and culture as a way to empower
themselves and take pride in their heritage.
