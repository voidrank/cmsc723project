In March of this year, 16-year-old Moroccan Amina Filali [committed
suicide](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/15/morocco-minor-forced-to-
marry-her-rapist-commits-suicide/) after she was forced to marry her rapist,
and Moroccans [expressed their
outrage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/16/morocco-sit-in-planned-to-
raise-awareness-about-the-plight-of-rape-victims/) at the incident. Now
Jordanians are speaking up about a 15-year-old rape victim who has been
married off to the man convicted of raping her, whose death sentence has been
dropped as a consequence.

The sentence was dropped thanks to Article 308 of the Jordanian Penal Code
that allows convicted rapists to walk free if they marry their victims. A
campaign has now been launched to get the law abolished.

No to 308 campaign.

Blogger Naseem Tarawnah [summarised the case](http://www.black-
iris.com/2012/05/01/whats-really-killing-jordanian-women/) that has angered
people:

> A 19 year old Jordanian kidnaps a 14 year old girl (with the assistance of
> his family) – takes her to a location where a tent was set up for him to
> rape her repeatedly for three straight days before the police roll in. The
> court sentences him to death by hanging but he manages to produce a very
> recent marriage certificate signed by a judge. The court then stays the
> execution but claims that it will be reinstated should the boy divorce her
> without a “justifiable cause”. A professor of sociology from the University
> of Jordan was widely quoted by the original article produced by Arab Al Yawm
> – that “women are different in nature from men” and that the girl should now
> make her best of the situation and play the role of a good wife, mostly by
> putting this whole silly rape thing behind her.

Twitter users in Jordan have condemned Article 308 and expressed their outrage
at the way criminals are permitted to escape punishment while their victims
are effectively punished. Activists and concerned Jordanians have been
tweeting about Article 308 under the hashtag [#جريمة308
](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A9308)
(#Crime308) [ar] in order to raise awareness, and to garner support for a
[petition that aims to collect 20,000
signatures](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/308_jordanian_law/) [ar]
against Article 308:

نعلن رفضنا القاطع لما يطال النساء المغتـَـصبات من جرائم مركـّبة تحت مسمى
العقوبات المخففة التي يوفرها القانون للمغتصب، ونسجل مواقفنا الرافضة لتخفيف
العقوبة عن المجرمين، وتضييع حق الضحية والمجتمع تحت حماية القانون

We declare our unequivocal rejection for the multiple crimes that befall
female rape victims because of the legal provisions for sentence reductions
for rapists. We take a firm stance against both sentence reductions for
criminals, and the dismissal of the victim's and society's rights, all under
the banner of the law.

The petition also calls for stricter punishments for sexual assault and for
the annulment of the category itself. In Jordan, sexual assault is any forced
sexual act save for forced penile-vaginal penetration, which is the only act
legally regarded as rape. Consequently, the rape of a male is not legally seen
as rape, and neither is the forced penile-anal penetration of a female.

Tweets under the #Crime308 hashtag have mostly focused on the personal and
social cost of Article 308 and highlighted its failings.

Crime308 is the art of destroying a woman's honour and her future, as well as
her family's dignity. It tramples on society and in the end the criminal is
acquitted

Hadeel Abdel Aziz, Executive Director of Jordan's Justice Center for Legal Aid
affirmed:

[@hadilaziz:](https://twitter.com/#!/hadilaziz/status/199558916554752000)‬ لن
نسمح بمعاقبة الضحية ولن نسمح بافلات المغتصب من العقوبة سنعمل على تعديل قانون
العقوبات

[@hadilaziz:‬](https://twitter.com/#!/hadilaziz/status/199558916554752000) We
will not allow victims to be punished and rapists to walk free anymore. We
will change the penal code.

The campaign against Article 308 was launched just weeks ago, but in this
short period the campaign has had two volunteer meetings, gathered over 2000
signatures on its petition, and received considerable media coverage. Active
beyond Twitter, the campaign is also present on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/132446410212930/).

Its use of social media has enabled it to get the support of prominent figures
like the head of the Jordan National Commission for Women, an ex-minister, and
an MP. However, Jordanian public outrage at this injustice is yet to bear
fruit in the form of the abolishment of Article 308. There are high hopes this
will be achieved before Jordan gets its own Amina Filali.
