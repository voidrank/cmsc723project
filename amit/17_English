The situation in Thailand is improving as floodwaters are
[receding](http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_around_thailand.php?id=5995) but the
death toll has now reached more than 600, according to [Saksith
Saiyasombut](http://asiancorrespondent.com/69497/the-thai-floods-and-the-
geographics-of-perception-part-2-certain-fear-of-the-uncertainty/):

> Now that the worst seems to be over and the tide are slowly, but steady
> receding in many parts of the country, a sense of normalcy returns to
> Bangkok. However, the suffering for many in the affected areas continue,
> there’s still conflict along the barriers and the death toll is now over
> 600.

[Ladprao64](http://jcwalsh.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/getting-back-to-normal/)
also observes that life is getting back to normal in many places:

> Although many people are still struggling with flooded homes and workplaces
> on the vicinity of Bangkok, further north and some areas of the city itself,
> our little patch is getting back to normal. We went to Central Ladprao on
> Saturday – it had opened the day before – and had no real difficulty getting
> there. There was some water near the SCB Plaza and cars were using the two
> outside lanes but the inside ones would have been passable if necessary.
>
> Apart from that, there was plenty of mud to show where the water had reached
> and the place is going to look rather shabby for a while.

The [flood disaster](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/30/thailand-
floods-and-social-media/) in Thailand is the
[worst](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/08/thailand-flooding-disaster/)
in the past five decades in terms of human casualties and damages in
properties and infrastructures. But the disaster which flooded majority of the
provinces for several weeks, including parts of Bangkok, also showed the
inventive ways of people as they coped with the floods.

[Thai Flood Hacks](http://thai-flood-hacks.tumblr.com/) is a Tumblr account
which gathers the interesting flood devices and approaches which were created
by ordinary residents to survive the floods. For example, below is an
improvised boat made of [plastic
tubs](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150334158595838&set=a.385783970837.164884.326943975837&type=1&ref=nf):

Worried about parking in flooded buildings? Below is some unique [motorbike
parking](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=264768866900435&set=a.109560389087951.5021.109554005755256&type=1&ref=nf):

And [car bags](http://thai-flood-hacks.tumblr.com/post/12600937940/car-bags-

This amphibious [pickup

ready for the flooded roads:

Universities also helped in manufacturing
[devices](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Universities-and-inventors-
doing-their-bit-30169810.html) that could help save lives during the flooding.
A popular example is the [FloodDuck](http://www.facebook.com/floodduck54)
which gives a
[warning](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=810271317820&set=o.207387662667924&type=3)
of electric current in the floodwater:

Clarice Africa identifies several [crowdsourcing
applications](http://www.futuregov.asia/blog/2011/nov/16/leveraging-digital-
volunteerism/) which provide useful information to residents. An example is
the website [Is my house flooded?](http://ismyhouseflooded.com/), “where
Bangkok residents who evacuated their respective homes can simply enter their
postal address and find out the flood situation near their homes.”

Here’s a story of [dog

soi-dog-a-rescue-from-the-
floods/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OttermanSpeaks+%28Otterman+speaks...%29)
and volunteers as they search and help stranded dogs in the city:

> We found several dogs in deserted houses & garages that were perched on
> floating cars. It was evident that they had not eaten in days. These dogs
> were terrified & our rescuers struggled to catch them with their nets & bare
> hands.
>
> We also found puppies stranded on a pile of floating rubbish who were
> delighted to see us & promptly jumped in our boat where they enjoyed some
> food & affection. Their mother was in deep water nearby & although
> terrified, we finally managed to rescue her also.
