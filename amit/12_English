Watching movies in theaters was once a favorite pastime for Bengalis. The
custom was to go to the movies on the holidays or special days. It was popular
culture to follow the fashion and postures of the stars of the new released
cinemas.

But cinema-loving Bengalis do not go to movie theaters nowadays and the
country's cinema halls are closing one by one, as new shopping malls are being
erected in their place. According to reports in the past decade, hundreds of
cinema halls have been [closed down](http://www.prothom-
alo.com/detail/date/2010-05-06/news/61206) [bn]. There also used to be
approximately 100 cinemas built each year, [which has now decreased to
30-40](http://dhumketo.blogspot.com/2012/04/by_5683.html) [bn].

Darashiko blogs on cinema regularly. Here he shares the [latest state of the
Bangladeshi film industry](http://www.darashiko.com/2012/01/swinging-future-
of-bd-cinema/) [bn]:

But why are movie theaters being closed down? Why are audiences not going to
movie theaters? [Megh Roddur](http://shopnoblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/blog-
post.html) writes [bn] about it:

> Of course I want to go to the movie theaters to watch movies. It hurts but
> the truth is that most of the movies are not of my taste. Why should I watch
> a movie full of weird costumes and blunt themes. Why should I go and watch
> repeating stories? Why should I go and watch copycats and gross copypaste
> movies?

A guest blogger at Sachalayatan reminisces about his childhood memories of
going to cinemas with family. [The
blogger](http://www.sachalayatan.com/guest_writer/44326) blames the film
distributors for lack of viewers in movie theaters:

> Now we don't watch movies in Theaters with family. I would not blame low
> quality pictures. I would place the blame on the environment of the movie
> theaters. There are a few good movies still being produced. Still we cannot
> go with the family to watch them in this environment.

[Lekhajoka Shamim](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/amishamimblog/29139146)
cites three reasons for the demise of this industry:

> The low quality of the local cinema, indecent movies and the environment of
> the movie thater are the causes of lack of movie viewers.

Once the thought of going to movie theaters was an exciting thing. Many had
keen interest. [Russel Ashraf](http://www.amrabondhu.com/russelacct/1920)
tells one such story:

> Me and my uncle went to see the movie “Aguner Poroshmoni”. We thought that
> there would be no rush and went a few minutes before the start. But alas, we
> saw that the queue was extended to the road. What to do! Waited in the queue
> for the tickets and manged a seat in front of the screen. I could not move
> my neck for three days in pain.

To save the film industry and bring more viewers in movie theaters, the
government decided to remove the ban on Indian cinema (it should be noted that
Indian movies have been banned here since 1965). This move attracted sharp
criticisms online.

[Nazrul Islam](http://www.amrabondhu.com/lokenbosh/943) says in a post in
Amrabondhu blog:

> Not from the hatred of Hindi language films, the government has to back down
> from such wretched decision to save a dying industry.।

But there are also those who favor import of movies:

[One blogger
](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/fahmidulhaqblog/29144602)(Fahmidul
Haque) says:

> To me its a right of a citizen to be able to watch local and international
> movies of different tastes. Lets not limit this right with the debate of
> saving of local industry by stopping the import of Indian movies.

Due to much criticism the government decided to reverse the decision to
withdraw ban from the Indian movies.

[Kallol Mustafa](http://www.mongoldhoni.net/2011/11/15/import-of-indian-
films/#.T6e0_-j9OjM) has specific suggestions on how to revive the local film
industry:

> We need government institution support, financial responsibility,
> institutionalization of the industry and mandatory show of international
> movies (not only Indian) in a week each month in every theater.
