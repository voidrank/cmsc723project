invention from Niger.

You might have heard of [Boyan
Slat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyan_Slat), a young Dutch inventor and
entrepreneur who created a system using the circulating ocean currents to
clean the ocean of trash and other pollutants. [His
project](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/), The Ocean Cleanup, received a lot
of attention after Slat gave a [TEDx Talk in
2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ) about it, attracting more
than $31.5 million in donations from sponsors including
[Salesforce.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce.com
"Salesforce.com") and philanthropist [Peter
Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel "Peter Thiel").

The next young inventor seeking to help the environment just might come from
Niger. Meet Abdou Barmini, 22, who invented an anti-pollution device that
cleans the air from industrial fumes. Barmini says the device, called the APFI
Barelec, will clean 80% of the air impurities coming from factory chimneys. If
his claim is correct, his invention could prove to be particularly beneficial
for low-income countries.

Here is how it works as explained by the Barmini himself in the following
video (in French) produced by [SciDev
Afrique](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3eRH22jYKBUATY9vcjluuA "SciDev
Afrique"), the african portal of the news site on science and technology for
global development:

In the video, Barmini details the [process](http://www.scidev.net/afrique-sub-
saharienne/changements-climatiques/multimedia/un-nigerien-met-au-point-un-
purificateur-de-fumees-industrielles.html) of his invention:

> The prototype is to be installed at the base of the chimney of factories
> expelling the fumes. The T-shaped device captures the CO2-containing heavy
> substances from the fumes via an affinity-based chemical assay that binds
> CO2 particles. The purified fumes are expelled via the other branch of the
> T-shaped structure.

He adds that it is still at the prototype level, so a lot can be done to
optimize the device. His colleague Garba Boubacar, a researcher in physics and
environmental studies at the University of Niamey, Niger, [suggests
that](http://www.scidev.net/afrique-sub-saharienne/changements-
climatiques/multimedia/un-nigerien-met-au-point-un-purificateur-de-fumees-
industrielles.html):

> les particules en suspension dans l'air ne sont pas constituées que de gaz
> carbonique ; il y en a d'autres que son invention devra fixer, pour
> atteindre un taux de purification à 100%

> The heavy particles found in the fumes are composed of more than carbon
> dioxide; there are others particles that his invention will have to fix, in
> order to achieve a purification rate closer to 100%.

Barmini says he worked tirelessly for two years, funding his research with his
own income to achieve the prototype. His motivation for developing it was to
find a solution to his growing concerns about air quality and climate change
in his country of Niger.

The World Health Organization [reports that
](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/)ambient (outdoor) air
pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 3 million
premature deaths worldwide in 2012 and that 88% of those premature deaths
occurred in low- and middle-income countries. By reducing air pollution
levels, countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease,
lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases.

Niger is a landlocked country in Western Africa that is consistently one of
the lowest-ranked in the [United
Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")‘
[Human Development
Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human
Development Index"). Furthermore, the [West Africa region
](https://globalvoices.org/2014/02/18/adapting-to-extreme-climate-change-in-
mali-and-madagascar/)has been drastically
[affected](https://globalvoices.org/2015/08/28/8-ways-climate-change-is-
already-affecting-africa/) by climate change in the recent years. Niger's
economy relies heavily on mining of which uranium and coal are the largest
exports.

Therefore, air quality is an urgent and immediate issue for the nation that is
already suffering from an extremely hot and dry climate, severe drought and
recurrent famine.

You might ask, how is Barmini's invention different from other air purifiers?
Here is his explanation when[

Barmini's APFI Barelec does not use a filter. The prototype was built with
local materials that Barmini recycled, adapted and assembled to his needs.
Barmini hopes that his invention will be noticed by climate change
organizations that will help him finalize his project.
