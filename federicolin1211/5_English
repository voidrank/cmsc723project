A YouTube video featuring an
[Andalusian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_people) Spanish blogger
criticizing xenophobic attitudes in Spain toward the region of Catalonia has
gone viral.

Blogger Mel Domínguez ([@focusings](https://twitter.com/focusings)) uploaded
the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14ebPJ-AtM) [es] to her [Youtube
channel](http://www.youtube.com/focusingsvlogs) [es] on April 8th, 2013 as a
response to [anti-Catalanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Catalanism)
she has encountered in Spain. It has so far garnered more than two million
views and more than 35,000 comments.

The video comes at a time when tensions are high between Spain and the
autonomous community of Catalonia. With economic crisis ravaging the Iberian
peninsula, the movement for independence in Catalonia has [gained popular
support](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/catalan-independence-
rally-barcelona), straining relations between the region and the rest of the
country.

Domínguez, a 23-year-old [Huelva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huelva) native,
has been living in Barcelona for two years. In her video, titled “¡A mí me
hablas en español!” or “Speak to me in Spanish!”, she deconstructed what she
called “false myths” about the Catalan people:

She began by asserting:

> Estoy en contra de los españoles que odian a los catalanes por inercia, pero
> también estoy en contra de los catalanes que odian a los españoles con la
> misma intensidad.

I am against Spaniards who possess irrational disdain for the Catalan people,
just as I am against Catalans who hate Spaniards with the same intensity.

She asserted that, in her native
[Andalusia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), she was “raised to hate”
the Catalan people and Catalonia as symbols of all Spain's ills. Domínguez
explained that after moving to Barcelona, she came to believe that another
people's desire for political independence is perfectly valid:

> ¿Es que están ofendiendo a alguien por pensar que su tierra merece un estado
> propio? Mientras no sean radicales que van insultando a España, su
> pensamiento independiente me parece totalmente respetable. […] Cuando crecí
> y empecé a conocer esta tierra, me di cuenta de que es una tontería odiar
> por odiar.

Are they offending anyone for desiring a state for their homeland? As long as
someone isn't a radical who spews hate for Spain, their belief in their own
sovereignty seems perfectly respectable to me… When I grew and began to
understand this place, I came to realize how absurd it is to hate for the sake
of hate.

Domínguez also sought to set the record straight about “false myths,” such as
a commonly held belief that Spanish speakers in Catalonia are marginalized and
face discrimination, or that the Catalan-language is a dialect of Spanish:

> Un dialecto es el andaluz, el canario, el murciano. El catalán se rige por
> sus propias reglas ortográficas, sus propias conjugaciones verbales, su
> propia escritura.

A dialect is [Andalusian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia),
[Canarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands),
[Murcian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia). Catalan is made of and
governed by its own orthography, its own verbal conjugations, its own body of
literature.

Domínguez also explained that when she was young, her desire to watch the
Catalan-language television program
“[Crackòvia](http://www.tv3.cat/crackovia)” [ca] led to often heated arguments
with her father, who would say, “I'd watch English television before anything
in Catalan” — an attitude Domínguez qualified as radical: to hate “just
because”, in her own words. She concluded:

> Sé que no voy a cambiar el mundo grabando este vídeo, pero me he desahogado.

I know I won't change the world recording this video, but I just needed to
vent.

**Immediate reaction**

Ms Domínguez expected to generate both negative and positive reactions, but
she didn't expect large-scale amplification. Since she uploaded the video, she
has been receiving a steady stream of support. For instance, Catalan
illustrator [Joan Pasqual](http://www.joanpasqual.cat/) [ca]
([joanpasqualart](http://www.youtube.com/user/joanpasqualart)) wrote to her on
YouTube:

> Chica, et felicito per la teva inteligència, simpatía i sentit de l'humor.
> M'has fet pasar una bona estona. Si hi haguès a Espanya molta gent que
> pensès com tu tot aniría millor. Moltes gràcies guapetona!!!!

Lady, cheers for your intelligence, sympathy and sense of humor. Thanks to you
I had a great time today. If there were more people in Spain who think like
you, things would be going so much better. Thank you!!!!

A little democratic and respectful air blowing in from Spain. Bless you, and

Nevertheless, despite clarifying her position against all forms of radicalism,
Domínguez wasn't able to evade criticism — and in some cases, personal insults
— from those who don't share her vision. It should be noted, however, that her
detractors continue to fall in the minority of those who reacted to her video.

[@uvejeje](https://twitter.com/Uvejeje/status/322718945238982656): I found
your video about “Catalanophobia” to be one of the most stupid and self-
victimizing frivolities that I've seen in years. Congratulations.

Some netizens, such as Twitter user Santiago Sánchez
([@murcianista77](https://twitter.com/murcianista77)) went as far to question
her own national authenticity:

[@murcianista77](https://twitter.com/murcianista77/status/323863758978031616):
If you're Andalusian you aren't neutral, idiot. Real Andalusians are anti-
separatists.

Beyond the blogosphere, various media outlets, such as [El
País](http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/04/15/catalunya/1366055253_937851.html)
[es] and television channel [8
TV](http://videos.lavanguardia.com/20130413/54372353759/entrevista-a-mel-
dominguez-en-8-al-dia.html) [ca], have reported on Domínguez's video. [La
Vanguardia](http://www.lavanguardia.mobi/slowdevice/politica/20130412/54372304365/joven-
andaluza-youtube-pequena-ensenaron-odiar-catalanes.html) [es] has even hired
her to offer[ her

**Fighting anti-Catalanism**

This video coincides with a broader initiative in Catalonia to fight perceived
anti-Catalanism. Beyond displays of national and cultural pride, such as the
region's traditional [Diada holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diada) and
last summer's
[controversial](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/12/twitterencatala-
provokes-tweets-of-joy-and-hate/) grassroots translation of Twitter's
interface, activists have been deliberately pushing back against a rising tide
of anti-Catalan sentiment in Spain's public and private spheres.

Aside from the Domínguez video, a notable case has been the website
[Apuntem.cat](http://www.apuntem.cat) [ca], which has had far-reaching success
in denouncing anti-Catalan activity online by collecting and sharing racist
tweets and blog posts.
