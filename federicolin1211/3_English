An online survey conducted by international PR and advertising giant
[Dentsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentsu) has found that [one in 13
Japanese people (7.7%) between the ages of 20 and
59](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20150506/k10010070851000.html ) identify
as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). The results of the original
Japanese-language survey can be requested [here](http://dii.dentsu.jp/).

This number is an increase from the results of a [2012 Dentsu
survey](http://dii.dentsu.jp/project/other/pdf/120701.pdf), [when 1 in 19
respondents](http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASH4R5TZ1H4RUTFL00H.html)
identified as LGBT.

The April 2015 survey results come barely a month after [several large cities
in Japan recognized same-sex civil
unions](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/03/03/move-to-recognize-same-sex-
marriage-in-japan-ignites-debate/), and as [the Japanese Ministry of Education
is set to introduce new curriculum promoting diversity](http://news-de-
smile.com/13-people-in-one-person-sexual-minorities-2057) in Japanese society.

In another [April 2015 news
release](http://www.dentsu.co.jp/news/release/2015/0423-004032.html),
advertising agency Dentsu has also identified the LGBT community as an
increasingly influential demographic of consumers in Japan with an annual
spending power of 5.94 trillion yen (approximately US$50 billion).

To determine that 7.7% of Japanese people identify as LGBT, on April 7 and 8,
2015, Dentsu surveyed 70,000 people over the Internet. The results were
reported by age:

>
> 自分が当事者かもしれないと気付いた時期については、「１３歳から１５歳」が最も多く１８．６％、次いで６歳以下が１７．２％、「１０歳から１２歳」が１６％、４０歳を過ぎてからという人も９．８％いました。一方で、当事者であることを誰にも明らかにしていないと答えた人は５６．８％に上っていました。

> When asked at what age they first realized they identified as gay, lesbian,
> bisexual or transgender, 18.6% (the most respondents) said between the ages
> of 13 and 15. After that, those who identified as LGBT by the age of 6 were
> the next most common group at 17.2%. 16% of respondents said they first
> identified as LGBT between the ages of 10 and 12. 9.8% of respondents first
> identified as LGBT after the age of 40. 56.8% of survey respondents did not
> reveal when they first identified as LGBT.

Around the same time, [Fumino Sugiyama](https://twitter.com/fumino810), a
transgender man who was a former fencer on the women's national team,
commented on news that Tokyo's Shibuya Ward would begin to issue certificates
recognizing same-sex unions. Speaking at an [April 23 press conference at the
Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan](http://www.fccj.or.jp/events-
calendar/press-events/icalrepeat.detail/2015/04/23/2854/-/press-conference-
fumino-sugiyama-shinya-yamagata-koyuki-higashi.html), Sugiyama said:

> 性的少数者が自分たちの隣にもいることを知ってほしい

> I want people to know that there are people who identify as LGBT (“sexual
> minorities,” 性的少数者) who are our neighbors.

[Sugiyama, born as a female, says he has known of his male identity since he
was in kindergarten](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/shibuya-
becomes-japans-first-ward-to-recognize-same-sex-marriage/article23701553/) and
used to cry as a child because he didn’t want to wear a skirt. Sugiyama has
gone on to become a successful entrepreneur, fashion model, entertainer and
[spokesperson for Japan's LGBT
community](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/06/23/national/media-
