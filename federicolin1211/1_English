The Nawat speaking community in El Salvador lamented the passing of Genaro
Ramírez, the Salvadorean who dreamed that the Nawat would still live. He was
the first teacher of the language, but not the last, because through his hard
work, Ramírez left an important legacy in the revitalization of his ancestral
language.

The Nawat Pipil is only spoken by 200 Salvadoreans, according to
[UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php). The vast majority
of them live in a small village called Santo Domingo de Guzmán, or Witzapan,
in Nawat. This is the hometown of Genaro where he worked for the regrowth of
the language for more than 40 years. He gave free classes every day of the
week, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. He had a mission. [In the words of Genaro
himself](https://www.facebook.com/Tzunhejekat/photos/a.165686056882540.33211.165601660224313/1349968341787633/?type=3&theater):

Before Genaro, there weren’t any Nawat teachers. The indigenous Salvadorean
community had entered a long silence since 1932, when 30,000 people, mostly
Nawat pipiles, were [executed ](http://www.proceso.com.mx/205371/el-salvador-
a-comision-de-la-verdad-el-genocidio-indigena-de-1932)by the army for having
rebelled over the lack of food during the popular revolt in the country in
1932. [The
uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Salvadoran_peasant_massacre) was
also a peasant revolt and the events, [commonly remembered by its perpetrators
as La
Matanza](http://www.revistas.una.ac.cr/index.php/historia/article/viewFile/1789/1695)
(“The killing”), are the focus of many debates today.

Global Voices spoke with Werner Hernández, member of the [Tzunhejekat
Collective](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Tzunhejekat/about/?ref=page_internal),
a project that seeks to spread the Nawat language through different means and
to make its native speakers aware. Hernández, a student and close friend of
Genaro Ramírez, comments on the situation of the Salvadoran indigenous
community:

> “[la comunidad indígena] se quedó afectada, se escondió. Ellos cambiaron sus
> apellidos, su vestimenta… su idioma. Todos todavía hablaban [el náhuat] en
> voz baja cuando surgió Genaro, el primer profesor de náhuat. Sabía que había
> nacido para eso.”

> [The indigenous community] was affected, it hid. They changed their
> surnames, the way they dressed…their language. Everyone was still speaking
> [Nawat] quietly when Genaro rose up, the first Nawat teacher. He knew that
> he was born for that.

Hernández also explained that the first Nawat teacher not only succeeded in
redeeming the pride of the indigenous Pipil people for their identity,
culture, and language, but also collapsed the walls between the Pipil
community and the rest of the country. He built bridges with the outside. It
was in this way that other Salvadorans, like Werner, could discover a hidden
part of their identity:

> “Me ha abierto las puertas a una experiencia maravillosa de conectarme,
> conmigo mismo, como salvadoreño. Así decimos en nuestro colectivo
> [Tzunhejekat]: el salvadoreño que habla el náhuat mira el país en tres
> dimensiones, porque podemos entender nuestra realidad más allá de las
> palabras.”

> It has opened the door to a wonderful experience connecting me, with myself,
> as a Salvadoran. Thus, as we say in our [Tzunhejekat] collective: the
> Salvadoran who speaks Nawat sees the country in three dimensions, because we
> can understand our reality beyond words.

Werner also recalls how the Nawat language is also a gateway to an extensive
cultural universe: “There are certain nuances and colors that with only
speaking the language, they understand each other. It’s not the same to go see
a ballet performance than reading a review of the show [that's how] reading a
translated poem [would be like].” This reflection is also incorporated into
debate in the country on the need to invest resources in the ancestral
language. “Value and [economic] price is not the same,” Werner adds.

Genaro inspired a new generation of Nawat teachers, he launched the enthusiasm
for the documentation of the language, broke taboos, and made the language
known in all the political levels of the country:

Today, because of the enthusiasm it generated, there are digital initiatives
that help spread the language and protect the indigenous Pipil culture. There
are collectives, such as [Tzunhejekat
](https://www.facebook.com/Tzunhejekat/?rc=p)and the [Nawat Carriers
Initiative](http://www.portadoresdelnahuat.org/), linguistic websites such as
[Tushik ](http://tushik.org/english/)and [its Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/180051382054311/), Nawat blogs such as
[Chachalaka](http://chachalaka.blogspot.mx/2014/01/se-iswat-genaro-
ramirez.html), and videos uploaded on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYqsaNZAzdRq94OfRO4odQ/feed):

Genaro Ramírez left a favorable ground for the survival of the Nawat language.
“The loss of Don Genaro marks our commitment to revitalize the language,”
concludes Werner Hernández.
