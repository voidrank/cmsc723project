A 14-year-old student in Singapore [took his own
life](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/01/14-year-old-jumps-to-his-death-
after-unaccompanied-police-interrogation/) a few hours after he was questioned
by the police for being a suspect in a molestation case, prompting a
[review](https://asiancorrespondent.com/2016/02/the-tragic-case-of-benjamin-
lim-is-singapores-justice-system-flawed/) of official procedure which allows
the police to interrogate minors even without the presence of a parent,
guardian, or adult counselor.

On January 26, 2016, Benjamin Lim was picked up from school by five police
officers dressed in plainclothes for an “interview” at a police station. The
teenager was accused of molesting an 11-year-old in a nearby residential
building. During the interrogation, which lasted three hours, Lim was not
accompanied by his parents. The police said he confessed to the crime,
although he later told his mother that he is innocent. After arriving home,
Lim took his life.

Lim’s family questioned the need to dispatch five officers to handle a case
involving a minor. They also believe that the teenager was traumatized during
the interview inside the police station.

His death led many people to demand a review of police procedure concerning
the proper way of handling children and other vulnerable sectors of the
population. The police acknowledged this and
[released](http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/police-review-interview-
procedures-young-persons?singlepage=true) a statement saying they would do
just that:

> The Police have been asked whether it should review the procedure to allow
> an appropriate adult to be present when a young person is interviewed. The
> Police will review and address this issue.

Lim’s father [felt](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/02/open-letter-from-
benjamins-family-to-clarify-what-transpired-on-26-janurary/) the review came
too late:

> As Benjamin’s father, I felt this is necessary, but it came too late. It is
> necessary because we pray that the same treatment my son received from the
> police, will never ever happen again to another child.

After Lim’s death was reported, some
[shared](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/02/14-year-olds-death-spurs-a-
mother-to-speak-up-on-sons-similar-experience/) how they were treated the same
way by the police during their younger years. There was even a case when an
elderly person with [dementia](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/02/father-
with-dementia-forced-to-confess-to-a-offence-by-police/) was apprehended and
interrogated without being accompanied by a relative.

Human rights group Community Action Network
[believed](http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/01/can-special-safe-guards-
needed-for-criminal-cases-involving-minors/) that Lim’s death “could have been
prevented had everyone involved in the investigation of this case showed
sensitivity towards the fact that they were investigating a minor.” It also
urged the placing of cameras inside interrogation rooms to make the
investigation process more transparent:

> We find it absurd that while public spaces are heavily surveilled with
> security cameras, interrogation rooms are not fitted with any cameras to
> allow for transparency of the interrogation process, which may be useful in
> an incident like this.

This particular demand is also being advocated in an online
[petition](https://www.change.org/p/ensure-protection-of-minors-during-police-
investigations):

> We believe that transparency is important when it comes to police
> investigations, especially when minors are involved. To that end, we support
> the police’s piloting of video recordings during questioning, and urge
> Parliament to pass legislation that would require mandatory video recordings
> of all police interrogations.

The Association of Women for Action and Research, which focuses on sexual
assault cases, urged the police to
[respect](http://www.aware.org.sg/2016/02/aware-statement-on-the-rights-of-
minors-in-criminal-investigations/) the rights of suspects, especially minors:

> If there is a general perception that criminal investigations may be unduly
> harsh or traumatic, especially for minors, this may deter victims from
> reporting. It is in everyone’s interest that criminal investigations respect
> the rights of suspects.

Meanwhile, the opposition Singapore Democratic Party
[questioned](http://yoursdp.org/news/ministers_39_silence_on_benjamin_lim_39_s_suicide_troubling/2016-02-05-6097)
the silence of concerned government ministries about the issue:

> The Ministers for Law, Education, and Home Affairs have kept silent on the
> matter. Given that a teenager has committed suicide resulting from a series
> of actions involving the police and the school, it behooves the Ministers
> to, at the minimum, address the situation and see how the matter is resolved
> and future incidents prevented.

The number one cause for suicide is untreated depression. Depression is
treatable and suicide is preventable. You can get help from confidential
support lines for the suicidal and those in emotional crisis. Visit
