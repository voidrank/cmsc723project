A heated debate started on July 19 when _Mahmoud Baroudi_ , a member at the
National Constituent Assembly (NAC)
[described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mEu-
XS-E2c&feature=player_embedded#!) Interim President _Moncef Marzouki_ , as the
“President of Banana Republic.” The declaration caused complete disorder
inside the NCA. MPs affiliated with the three party coalition government
called upon Baroudi to take back his words. He refused. “Only when you have a
President of a Republic, who does represent the Republic we can talk. I'm not
going to take my words back Mr. the President [referring to the NCA
President]. It is a Banana Republic, and all you [MPs] represent a Banana
Republic,” said Baroudi in response to the outraged MPs.

Baroudi used the term “Banana Republic” to comment on the controversial
presidential decision to [sack the Central Bank
Governor](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120718/ml-tunisia-
central-bank/). He was mainly mocking a presidential document appointing a new
Central Bank Governor. The document was dated July 11 – which was one week
before the decision to sack the former governor was approved by the NCA.

The English Oxford Dictionary defines a “Banana Republic” as “a small state
that is politically unstable as a result of the domination of its economy by a
single export controlled by foreign capital.” The derogatory term is often
used in political science to refer to politically unstable countries,
especially in central America, which rely on one export such as bananas.

**Tunisia: “A Fascist Banana Republic?”**

The author of [Le blog Boukornine](http://h-lifois.blogspot.com/) added the
adjective “Fascist” to the term “Banana Republic” to describe the “new
Tunisia.” The author
[explains](https://www.facebook.com/Boukornine/posts/501083249918025) his
choice [fr]:

> “République bananière” parce qu'aucune institution n'est respectée et qu'il
> n'y a aucune hiérarchisation des décisions et aucun respect de la légalité
> même des plus hautes sphères du pouvoir.
>
> “Fasciste” envers les TUNISIENS non-musulmans, envers les TUNISIENS athées,
> les TUNISIENS juifs, chrétiens, agnostiques, déistes, diabétiques,
> insuffisants rénaux… envers ceux qui ne veulent tout simplement pas jeûner
> et qui ont tout à fait le droit de se rendre librement dans un café pendant
> le ramadan ! (…)

“A Banana Republic” because not a single institution is respected, there is no
hierarchy in decision making, and no respect of lawfulness is manifested, even
from the highest spheres of authority.”Fascist” against non-Muslim Tunisians,
atheist Tunisians, Jew, Christian, Agnostic,deist, diabetic Tunisians, and
those who suffer from kidney failure…”Fascist” against those who simply do not
want to fast, and have the right to freely go to a café during Ramdan! (…)
