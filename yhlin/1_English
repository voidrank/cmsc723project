camp. Public domain.

In 1941, the Croatian radical right-wing [Ustashi movement
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e)came to power and formed the
Independent State of Croatia (NDH), led by Ante Pavelić. NDH followed fascist
regimes in Europe by forming concentration camps, and killing and persecuting
Serbs, Jews, and Romas, not to mention Croatian partisans and their families.

In August 1942, NDH built a camp in Sisak, Croatia, for both adults and
children. The [children's section of the concentration
camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisak_children%27s_concentration_camp) was
dubbed the “Shelter for Children of Refugees“ and was the biggest of its kind
in the Ustashi-run Independent State of Croatia. The so-called “shelter” was
led by Dr. Antun Najžer, under the patronage of The Female Lineages of the
Ustashi movement and Ustashi surveillance services. Today we have documents
showing that Dr. Najžer and his team performed tests on the children held in
the camp, starving to death some, and torturing in various ways others.

A monument in children section's camp graveyard says approximately 2,000
people are buried there, but there's never been an organized effort to exhume
the bodies, so no one knows for sure. A recent article on the Croatian news
site Portal Novosti describes the history of the camp, bearing the chilling
headline [“Sisak Also Had Its Mengele”](http://www.portalnovosti.com/i-sisak-
je-imao-mengelea) (referring to the Auschwitz concentration camp's infamous
physician).

The town of Sisak, subjected to another devastating conflict in the 1990s
during the Croatian Independence War, holds an event annually at the graveyard
on WWII Remembrance Day, laying wreaths on the memorial and inviting the
camp's survivors to speak.

[Dobrila Kukolj](http://www.jadovno.com/dobrila-kukolj.html#.VNNC6NKG--k) is
one of the children who managed to survive the horrors of the concentration
camp. Born in 1931 in Međeđa village, Bosnia-Herzegovina, she was placed in
several children's camps during the war. Her life changed forever in 1941,
when Ustashi forces attacked her village. In Portal Novosti's article, Kukolj
says she best recalls the Sisak and Jasenovac concentration camps, both in
Croatia, and describes what arriving at the camps was like:

> Ulazak u logor bio je ravan klubu smrti u kojem su vladali bezakonje i
> ludilo, gdje se čuo samo vrisak, plač i jauk do neba. Prizor od kojeg mi se
> i danas ledi krv u žilama je bježanje ispred ustaša koji su hvatali
> djevojčice i nad njima se iživljavali. Tada sam nehotice stala na tek rođeno
> dijete na zemlji, a taj plač mi i danas zvoni u ušima. Mi preživjeli
> logoraši smo na izmaku snage, a naša svjedočanstva ne smiju pasti u zaborav
> i zato molim sadašnju i buduće generacije da se bore da se zlo koje je donio
> rat više nikada ne ponovi, kako kod nas, tako i u cijelom svijetu.

> Entering the concentration camp was the same thing as entering a death club
> ruled only by lawlessness and madness, where you could hear only screams,
> crying and moaning, all the way to the sky. One sight that still freezes the
> blood in my veins is running from the Ustashes who were capturing little
> girls and then brutalizing them. That's when I accidentally stepped on a
> newborn lying on the ground. The cry it let out still rings in my ears. We
> who have survived the camps are at the end of our journeys, but our legacy
> shouldn't ever be forgotten and that's why I ask the generations who are
> here and who are yet to come to ensure that such evil brought by war never
> again returns—not in our country or any other.
