Palestinian prisoners [began an open ended hunger
strike](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/30/us-palestinians-hunger-
strike-idUSBRE83T0Y820120430) on April 17 to protest the conditions within
Israeli prisons. What had started earlier as a protest [by a
few](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/04/201241781739637933.html)
has now increased to thousands of participants (with figures varying between
1,400 and 3,000). Several of the prisoners who began their hunger strike
earlier are now [at risk of dying](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-
abunimah/urgent-action-needed-save-lives-palestinian-hunger-strikers-bilal-
diab-and-thaer).

There are more than [4,000 Palestinian
prisoners](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/30/us-palestinians-hunger-
strike-idUSBRE83T0Y820120430) in Israeli prisons, and around 320 have been
held without charge or trial under so-called [administrative
detention](http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention).

The situation in Israeli prisons has deteriorated over the years. The
prisoners are
[demanding](http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=267998)
an end to solitary confinement, administrative detentions and punitive
measures. Protests have [taken place in the
past](http://english.pnn.ps/index.php/prisoners/1498-ufree-network-
palestinian-prisoners-go-on-hunger-strike-to-claim-for-their-legitimate-
rights), but this strike is different, following as it does the widely
reported strike of [Khader
Adnan](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/15/dying-to-live-khader-adnans-
hunger-strike-for-palestinian-rights/).

Blogger and journalist Joseph Dana [wrote](http://josephdana.com/khader-adnan-
takes-aim-at-israel-and-gives-palestinians-hope/4434) about Adnan's case in
February:

> Mr Adnan’s story is emblematic of the administrative detention experience of
> many Palestinians. He claims to have been beaten and humiliated by Israeli
> soldiers while in custody, and began his hunger strike in protest.

Khader Adnan ended his hunger strike in February after 66 days, when the
Israeli authorities [agreed to release
him](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/04/201241718432553231.html)
on 17 April. Another prisoner, Hana Shalabi, ended a hunger strike after 40
days when she was [exiled to Gaza for three years](www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
middle-east-17582868) by the Israeli authorities.

In the current strike two prisoners, [Bilal
Dhiab](http://www.addameer.org/etemplate.php?id=462) and [Thaer
Halahleh](http://www.addameer.org/etemplate.php?id=471), are at [grave risk of
death](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/urgent-action-needed-
save-lives-palestinian-hunger-strikers-bilal-diab-and-thaer).
