On Monday, after nearly ten months of deliberation, the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) declared that the [1995 Srebrenica
Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre) was an act of
genocide, but that the pattern of the atrocities committed by Bosnian Serbs
during the [1992-1995 war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War) (which
claimed more than 100,000 lives) was “too broad” to qualify for the definition
of genocide. The ICJ also decided there was no sufficient evidence to pin the
blame on Serbia.

Below is a selection of responses to the ICJ verdict by the Balkan and
international bloggers writing in English.

On the eve of the verdict, Eric Gordy of _East Ethnia_ posted [this detailed
analysis](http://eastethnia.blogspot.com/2007/02/waiting-for-verdict.html) of
what there was to expect from the ICJ and how the decision could influence the
region's politics:

> […] This type of business will always be implicated in day to day politics.
> The Serbian Radical Party
> [wants](http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/23/europe/EU-GEN-Serbia-UN-
> Kosovo.php) the country to quit the UN in the event of a guilty verdict.
> Afghanistan's parliament has passed a resolution granting
> [amnesty](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6389137.stm) to a whole
> hatful of powerful war criminals. And the general assembly of the state of
> Virginia has passed a resolution
> [apologizing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6394981.stm) for slavery.
> Insistence on denial or opening up the books are pretty much the only
> options available. Time does not make anything go away.

In a comment to Gordy's post, Shaina (who blogs at [_Bosnia
Vault_](http://bavault.blogspot.com/)) wrote:

When the verdict arrived, _Bg anon_ left this comment, summarizing the mood in
Belgrade:

> Well we have it now – and dare I say it, a sigh of relief really.

[In his next post](http://eastethnia.blogspot.com/2007/02/initial-
response.html), Gordy reviewed the initial reactions to the verdict in the
Bosnian and Serbian political circles – and offered his own judgment:

> The finding that a crime occurred but that nobody is guilty of committing it
> tends toward a bizarre sort of mysticism. And the finding that the Serbian
> state is not responsible seems to be based on a very strict interpretation
> of rules of evidence, in which the destruction or withholding of
> documentation may have proved to be an effective strategy, and indirect
> evidence was not treated as relevant. This seems to offer a sort of legal
> invitation to criminals to cover their tracks, and the precedent will
> probably be controversial.

He also mentioned a few other bloggers’ views:

> Not everyone will agree with me, of course. What I have seen in Blogland so
> far: [Viktor](http://belgrade.org.yu/blog/397/my-verdict) Marković was

> acquittal of Milošević. And
> [Yakima](http://yakimagulagliterarygazett.blogspot.com/2007/02/un-decision-

> “lame assed” (and I have a feeling she is not thinking of an injured

One of the comments to this entry was written by Seesaw (aka [Quod/Zdenka
Pregelj](http://flickr.com/people/52911568@N00/)), a 64-year-old Sarajevo
resident [whose photoblog](http://miljacka1942.blogspot.com/) offers beautiful
images of the city – “the ones that you usually do not see”:

> […] I am old enough to realize, few days before the decission on Kosovo, the

> I can agree on the part that Serbia did not commit genocide (what happened
> in Bosnia can not be compared with WWII), but to abolish Serbia from
> responsibilty, makes me wonder why did Đinđić bother (and got killed because

In his [last post on the issue so
far](http://eastethnia.blogspot.com/2007/02/guest-post-another-response-to-
icj.html), Gordy opened up his blog to Andras Riedlmayer, a “friend of _East
Ethnia_ (and plaintiffs’ witness)” – who was also cited by _Bosnia Vault_ ‘s
Shaina, [here](http://bavault.blogspot.com/2007/02/genocidal-people.html):

> A number of people on the political fringes have tried to show that a guilty
> verdict against Serbia would mean that Serbia is a “genocidal nation” and
> that the average Serb will have to bear a cross as being labeled part of a
> “genocidal people.”
>
> […] As Andras Riedlmayer explains here, in a way the the ICJ trial is not
> too different in concept from the trials of citizens suing towns or city
> halls for discrimination. An affirmation that one was discriminated against,
> does not render every single person in that town guilty of discrimination;
> but the specific people and city government institutions that are
> responsible for said act of discrimination.

Gordy, in the [Waiting for the
Verdict](http://eastethnia.blogspot.com/2007/02/waiting-for-verdict.html) post
mentioned above, also tackled the issue of collective blame/guilt:

> […] A guilty verdict would not change the criminal guilt of the people who
> ordered, facilitated and carried out crimes, nor would it change the legal
> innocence of the huge majority who did not. But it would mark a moment at
> which it would be appropriate to embark on various ways of recognizing
> responsibility. […]

“You probably heard most of the news coverage on this event, but as the
verdict is being read this very moment it occured to me that you maybe haven’t
heard enough personal opinions on the matter, at least from the Serbian side,”
wrote Viktor Marković of _Belgrade 2.0_ in an entry titled [My
Verdict](http://belgrade.org.yu/blog/397/my-verdict). Later, in the rather
busy comment thread, he elaborated on his personal position regarding the
ICJ's ruling:

> I don’t feel guilty. But the genocide did happen. I feel ashamed for the
> monsters that did it and who thought they are doing me a favour by doing it.
> But i can’t feel guilty instead of someone else. Best and least i can do is
> to say that I am sorry that it happened.
>
> That’s exactly what the court decided: Serbia is not guilty – but there was
> a genocide. […]
>
> Like i said this is the downside of the verdict – that there will always be
> someone to interpret this decision by saying that now, since Serbia is
> aquitted most charges, it is clear the genocide did not happen at all.

_South East Europe Online_ ‘s author – bytycci, “a graduate student preparing
to start saving the world soon” – mentioned the anti-Kosovo independence rally
held outside the U.S. embassy in Belgrade Tuesday in [his post on the ICJ
verdict](http://seeuropeonline.blogspot.com/2007/02/can-serbia-oficially-
condemn-srebrenica.html); in the comments section, Bg anon argued that there
was no connection between the two events; bytycci responded to that and also
clarified his position on the politics behind the verdict:

> I know the rally didn't have to do anything with the ICJ ruling. But it is
> one of the incidents of nationalist gloating in Serbia.
>
> I am not saying that ICJ is politically motivated. I said this decision was
> politically motivated. It was meant to reduce tensions and say to Serbia
> “it's not true that the world hates you”. And all it did was help the
> nationalists by giving them a reason to say “look we didn't do anything
> wrong”.
