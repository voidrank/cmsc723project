As local blogospheres around the world grow, many blogging communities are
organizing meetups and competitions to reward bloggers and build a better
sense of community. The Syrian blogosphere, which is quite active and centered
around Arabic and English, has recently joined the realm of competitive
blogospheres, with a [competition for the best Syrian
blogs](http://competition.almudawen.net/) launched by blogging community
[_Almudawen_](http://almudawen.net/), and sponsored by several Syrian
organizations.

Syrian blogger Omar Mushaweh, writing at _AlMarfaa_ ,
[announced](http://www.almarfaa.net/?p=613) the competition [ar]:

أعلن موقع المدوّن عن انطلاق مسابقة لأفضل المدونات السورية ، وهي مسابقة سنوية
يقوم بها ويرعاها موقع (المدوّن) مجتمع المدونات السورية ، وذلك في يوم 8/8 من كل
سنة بمناسبة الذكرى السنوية لتأسيس موقع المدوّن ، وتعتبر هذه السنة هي المسابقة
الأولى ، و التي تعتبر أول مسابقة من نوعها للمدونات السورية .

_Al Mudawen_ announced the launch of a contest for the best Syrian blogs,
which is an annual competition sponsored by the Syrian blogging community on
August 8 of each year to mark the anniversary of its establishment. This
year's contest is the first competition of its kind for Syrian blogs.

The competition has not been without controversy. _Abu Fares_ , a Syrian
blogger who writes in English, expressed frustration at a clause in the
blogging competition's rules,
[stating](http://www.abufares.net/2009/08/changes.html):

> This is a commendable effort on their part if it's indeed intended to honor
> outstanding Syrian blogs, encourage and support a blogging culture and
> expose the role of blogs in the making and shaping of a civil society in
> Syria. However, if you read the 5th and last condition for blogs to be
> accepted in the competition, this is what you'll find (translated word by
> word): the contents of which [the submitted blog] must not dissent from the
> accepted mores and morals (i.e. sex through videos or photos, hostility to
> religions, cussing, swearing and bad taste). Do I take it that it is
> acceptable for a blog to attack trans-dressers but not Sheikhs and priests?
> Or, for the sake of argument, is a photo of a random cloud in the sky in the
> shape of an eye and a comment underneath that this is the eye of God
> acceptable but not another photo of a woman's perfect behind with the apt
> remark that this butt is an elegant example of the splendor of creation (if
> we're so inclined to believe)?

Global Voices’ own [Yazan Badran](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/yazan-
badran/), in his blog _On Olives and Sake_ , discussed the aftermath of _Abu
Fares_ ‘ observations, analyzed the situation and, following its resolution,
[wrote](http://yazanbadran.com/blog/2009/08/in-good-faith/):

> The discussion that followed was an interesting experience. After years at
> Wikipedia, I’ve learned to always start a discussion while _[assuming good
> faith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)_ , and this
> was very much inline with that. And while there was a major disagreement on
> the most fundamental issues, _[Omar Mushaweh](http://www.almarfaa.net/)_,
> the Admin of Al-Mudawen, (and the only representative from the site in the
> contest, it should be mentioned), was quite courteous in understanding the
> reservations that I, and other Judges, had on said prerequisite. And he
> readily accepted to remove it.

Yazan, who will also be judging the competition, added:

> It is interesting to note, that while there was no consensus on the issue
> itself, there was a consensus on resolving the issue. Not to make a big deal
> out of it, but it is a refreshing incidence in a blogosphere that is growing
> more and more apart, and more and more bitter.

Readers of Yazan's blog shared their reactions in the comments. _Katia_
applauded the decision, stating:

> The majority is not always right, that is a fact. In a pure democracy, both
> the majority and the minority each have common interests and that is
> basically the only rope holding them together. Once the cards get shuffled,
> the positions change and individuals whose interests do not match the
> group’s anymore, end up disappointed and bitter. Eventually, many of those
> who find themselves at the short end turn to extremes to show off their
> difference from the “evil” group and its “corrupt” stands. Now, if only the
> concepts of compromise and consensus were practiced as thoroughly as pure
> lobbying, we could see some sunbeams shining through again.

Another reader, _Razan_ , noted that:

> Nevertheless, this condition does not stand on its own when it comes to
> Almudawen’s problems. On AlMudawwen’s “add your blog” page, the same
> condition appears at the bottom of the “conditions” list to add a blog.

Musing on the blogosphere in general, she added:

> It’s worth to note, that posts on intimacy and sex is another approach to
> understanding a given society. So if there is a blogger telling us about
> Hash and sex, I think it tells us a lot about a certain society that it
> exists in Syria and it’s marginalized by “our given morals”. By
> marginalizing these voices, we are to put it bluntly: censors, worst type of
> censors, since we advocate “free speech”. I don’t mind at all, for
> almudawwen to accept certain voices, but it should be clear about it,
> presenting itself as accepting like-minded voices, but i think it’s not
> right to say something and do otherwise.

Syrian bloggers have until August 22, 2009 to [submit their
blogs](http://competition.almudawen.net/) to the competition.
