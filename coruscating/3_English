An upturn in the arrival of refugees to Australia by boat has brought tragedy
and controversy. The issue of border protection that dominated the 2001
Federal election has re-emerged with extra venom.

A refugee boat has exploded off the north west coast.Three people are dead,
two are missing and more than thirty have been injured, some with very serious
burns. Three members of the Australian Defence Force, which was towing the
boat, are among the injured.

Allegations that the fatal explosion was caused by asylum seekers have also
revived the political storm surrounding the [children overboard
affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_overboard_affair).

A political stoush has erupted with Opposition parliamentarians accusing the
government of causing the increase in boat people and encouraging people
smuggling through its changes to border protection.

Bloggers are also taking off the gloves. Gary Sauer-Thompson at _Public
Opinion_ bemoaned the attempts to politicise asylum seekers again:

Mark Thomson’s blog, _Seeking Asylum Down Under_ , has a clear purpose:

> Yes, we remember! Blame the victims for their own plight, extract as much

> of ADF personnel who cannot answer for themselves, and then whip up public

Another progressive blog, _Club Troppo_ , was more restrained:

The alternative view was put strongly by Andrew Bolt, newspaper columnist for
Rupert Murdoch’s _Herald-Sun_ and perhaps Australia’s best known and
controversial right-wing blogger:

> AT least three boat people now dead. So how much “kinder” do Kevin Rudd’s

Possum Comitatus at _Pollytics_ did not show any restraint when condemning
Bolt’s post:

Not the usual sort of criticisms we expect from a statistician and
psephologist. For his data analysis you’ll have to visit Possum’s post.

It appears that most of those on the boat were fleeing Afghanistan, a country
where Australian troops are currently fighting the Taliban.
