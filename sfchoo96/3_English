Singapore police have summoned 17 individuals for participating in a
candlelight vigil held on July 13, 2017,
[accusing](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/police-
probe-17-over-possible-illegal-assembly) the group of activists and
journalists of organizing an ‘illegal assembly.’

The group gathered outside Changi Prison in eastern Singapore to show support
for the family of Malaysian migrant worker [Prabagaran
Srivijayan](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2017/07/13/the-case-against-
prabgarans-execution-are-we-100-sure-that-this-man-is-guilty/), who was
executed on drug trafficking charges on July 14.

Prabagaran insisted on his innocence up until the end of his life, and several
human rights groups urged the Singaporean government to spare Prabagaran and
revisit the case. But his execution sentence was carried out, and Prabagaran
became the fourth person
[executed](https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/singapore/halt-the-execution-
of-prabagaran-srivijayan) by Singapore in 2017 on drug-related charges.

Although many of the 17 individuals who joined the vigil were [anti-death
penalty](https://globalvoices.org/2015/01/06/a-death-sentence-for-
trafficking-15-grams-of-heroin-singapore-groups-say-no-more/) advocates, they
mainly intended to show solidarity with Prabagaran's grieving family.

During the candlelight vigil, several police officers arrived and confiscated
the candles but allowed the vigil to continue as long as candles were not lit.

Two months later, Singaporean police are now probing the individuals who
joined the vigil for violating the law on public assembly. It is[ strictly
prohibited](http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;query=DocId%3A387d5223-4e87-42fb-88bd-1b1b47c61433%20%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0)
in Singapore to hold a gathering without a permit under Section 16(2)(a) of
the Public Order Act, Chapter 257A.

Writer [Kirsten Han](https://globalvoices.org/author/kixes/), a Global Voices
contributor who attended the vigil and later
[received](https://www.facebook.com/kixes/posts/504343376873) the police
summons, described the experience on Facebook, and
[wondered](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=504338731183&set=a.502329437823.99.220200003&type=3)
why the vigil was deemed an illegal assembly:

> I understand that it is the police’s duty to protect law and order and to
> uphold the laws of our country. But when a simple, nonviolent, quiet vigil
> for a man about to be hanged by the state is deemed an illegal assembly
> worthy of a police investigation, perhaps it is time to think about whether
> we are striking the right balance between public order, freedom of assembly
> and compassion.

The police also summoned Terry Xu, editor of The Online Citizen news website,
who expressed
[surprise](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155814358483919&set=a.36126863918.44848.661438918&type=3)
to learn the vigil was viewed by police an act of illegal assembly:

> An “illegal public assembly” to grieve over an individual who was put to
> death under the state law, and insisted that he is innocent till the point
> he was hanged at the gallows. It was also an “illegal public assembly” where
> the police officers turned up at the scene and said it was okay to gather so
> long there is no candles placed.

The police are apparently preventing those who attended the vigil from leaving
the country without clearance from authorities. Terry Xu was stopped by
immigration officers while preparing to travel outside Singapore:

> Are the police acting as judges to decide whether or not one can leave the
> country without putting the matter to court?
>
> If this is not harassment, I don't know what else can be considered as one.

Human rights groups have criticized the police for harassing individuals
participating in a peaceful vigil. Function 8, a Singapore-based NGO, released
a statement
[describing](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2017/09/04/function-8-stop-
harassment-and-intimidation-of-citizens-participating-in-civil-society-
activities/) the case as going “against the spirit of our Constitution and a
waste of police resources.”
