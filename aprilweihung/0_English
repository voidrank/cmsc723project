Every year since 1982, people all around the world join forces on September
21, the International Day of Peace, to show their own commitment to worldwide
peace and to work in cooperation for this goal. Events around the world range
in scale from private gatherings to public concerts, and online initiatives.

Among these, there is The SunFlower Post, a [new
project](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/03/21/beginnings/) where young
females from different parts of the world write local news from a gender
perspective. Their bloggers have chosen worldwide peace as the theme of the
month, as the Editor in Chief, and [Global Voices
author](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/andrea-arzaba/), Andrea Arzaba
[explains](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/09/04/september-surprises/):

Kicking off the series from Mexico, Andrea Arzaba comments on the last yearly
governance report speech given by the president, and his focus on the future.
She advocates that for a country to achieve future peace, [it is necessary to
focus on the actions of
now](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/09/05/rootsofpeace/):

> Calderon focused on the drug war problems and situation that has grown
> during his presidency, as well as the economical crisis that Mexico faces.
> He focused on insecurity, on the moment of confusion and sadness that people
> are living today. He focused on “a better tomorrow”. But … what about today?
>
> I felt he did not gave importance on his actions for achieving peace, which
> is crucial at this moments of uncertainty. I believe his intentions are good
> – trying to defeat drug-dealing crimes, but we need to pay attention on the
> roots of the problem.
>
> Educated children and values are crucial to achieve peace. When we have
> young people involved in the drug war this is because they did not have a
> proper education, they did not have enough opportunities to do something
> else and earn money in a different way. They are inside this cycle, one that
> will not let you get out easily.

From China, Amily Yang points out that traditional Chinese wisdom like Dao and
Zen can be recipes to achieve inner-peace. Paradoxically, reflecting on a
recent high-speed train crash that killed more than 35 passengers, she laments
that this wisdom is barely present in the fast-paced China of today. She
challenges her fellow Chinese [to slow down in order to find inner
peace](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/09/12/inner-peace/):

> The high-speed train was supposed to be a gift for the nation, yet officers
> were getting commands to fasten the project. One example is that a driver
> only spent 10 days learning – and normally it would take him about 3 or 4
> months in training.
>
> EVERYTHING is fast in China. Students hurry to find a job and get promotion,
> workers hurry to make more products, women hurry to find a husband and get
> married, officers hurry to make the GDP number shining and good for their
> promotion. We are moving towards a better society, for we think we are
> moving faster and developing.
>
> Yes, developing is the key word, especially when an economy is emerging.
> That is the only focus today for the country.
>
> “Please my China, slow down and wait for the people to follow up, do not
> focus too much on just hurrying up.” is a popular phrase, widely spread.
>
> We have peace now, with no war or conflict in the country.
>
> We have peace now, so that the State focuses on developing our economy.
>
> But how about inner peace? Could the State somehow slow down a little bit,
> to catch up with what the citizens really need, as family values, as food
> security, as trust among the nation, as no corruption. Are people allowed to
> slow down a little bit, to find peace?
>
> That could also be a question for individuals. I dare you slow down, to make
> a choice among all the good stuff you desire, and find what you really care
> for? To find your inner peace…

[Where Does Peace Begin?](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/09/19/where-does-
peace-begin/) This is one of the eternal questions that Natalia Semicheva
constantly asks herself. She is from Russia, a country that according to the
Global Peace Index 2011 occupies 147th place among 153 peaceful states, this
means a high level of violence and crime. She argues that the more aggressive
you are, the more you start to understand peace:

> Not in the UN resolutions, but in our families. Peace should come from your
> mother’s hug, from your husband’s kiss, from the first steps of your child.
> We should start focusing in our relatives and friends, respecting our
> parents, taking care of our children. Before loving humanity, we should
> first learn to love each other in our little family world. Only then we
> could share that inner peace with everybody that we meet in our life.

From Turkey, Neslihan Çiflik [wonders about the end of
war](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/09/17/the-end-of-war/):

> I haven’t been present in any period of war during my life. I’m watching
> death like watching a movie on TV. My consciousness can’t accept reality.
> Even I can’t put myself in their place. I can’t think that it could also
> happen to me.
>
> Unfortunately, there is war with or without guns.
>
> It’s embarrassing to sit safely at home and write a letter of peace.
>
> You know why? Because it sounds terrible that a human is killing some other,
> more than when someone is killed somewhere, far away. I’m not dying with
> this dying person. I’m getting dirty with the killer and I’m carrying this
> disgrace in my skin, in my blood.
>
> Maybe I’m collapsing someone’s safe house, stealing his or her breath and
> his or her smile in this world. And maybe stealing her children’s smile as
> well.
>
> I couldn’t believe that I can do or may do all of these. It’s a terrible
> shame.
>
> This can’t be our aim to be born. My existence can’t give any pain to
> another person.
>
> According to me that war is unbelievable from these sides. People die of
> disease or disaster. But this is not a disease, this is not a disaster, this
> is not faith.
>
> Why do I do this? Our old world needs peace. Human, nations, environment,
> animals and herbs, and states are tired.

Finally, Anna Zemblicka from Latvia remembers August 23, 1989, the day two
million Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians joined hands to form a massive
human chain. It was [The Baltic Way that Moved the
World](http://thesunflowerpost.org/2011/09/21/the-baltic-way-that-moved-the-
world/):

> The Baltic Way encouraged democratic movements throughout the Soviet Union
> and with it, international society payed attention to the Baltic region in a
> great extent. Within a year and a half, all three Baltic countries formally
> declared their independence. By September 1991, the world’s governments
> recognized their independence.
>
> Historians and other experts claim that the Baltic Way “created a precedent
> that was and hopefully will be, followed by a number of countries all over
> the world – the triumph of humanity over totalitarianism in a peaceful way”.

Peace Day is an opportunity for reflections on individual and planetary
progress toward peace, and time for “commemorating and strengthening the
ideals of peace both within and among all nations and peoples”, as the U.N.
Resolution that established the [International Day of
Peace](http://internationaldayofpeace.org/about/background.html) explains.
