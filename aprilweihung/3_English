Ilan Chaim Grapel, an American immigrant to Israel, was arrested in Egypt last
Sunday. Grapel has now been detained for 15 days as he is being questioned by
the State Security Prosecution over alleged espionage activities in Egypt,
attempting to instigate conflict between the Egyptian people and the Supreme
Council of Armed Forces, and to incite religious conflict between Muslims and
[Copts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copts).

In an interview published on Monday 13 June, 2011, on the Lebanese news site
_El Nashra_ , Yehia El-Gamal, Egypt's deputy prime minister in the interim
cabinet, [has accused Israel of being behind the sectarian tension plaguing
Egypt](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14206/Egypt/Politics-/Israel-
behind-sectarian-tension-in-Egypt-Deputy-PM.aspx).

Desmond Shephard [reported the news](http://bikyamasr.com/wordpress/?p=34689)
on _Bikya Misr_ blog saying:

> Judge Hesham Badawi of the Supreme State Security Prosecution ordered the
> suspect, named as Elan Chaim Grabel, detained for 15 days on suspicion of
> “spying on Egypt with the aim of harming its economic and political
> interests,” the MENA news agency reported.

The Israeli officials on the other hand refused the accusations, and [called
the reports from Cairo to be
unreliable](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4081105,00.html).

Egyptian blogger Hossam El-Hamalawy [didn't digest Grapel's espionage
story](http://www.arabawy.org/2011/06/13/the-almighty-israeli-spies/), and he
stated historical incidence to show that such kind of stories are usually
suspicious:

> When students and workers took to the streets in Alexandria, November 1968,
> denouncing the Nasserist regime, the state-run media announced the arrest of
> Israeli spies who were involved in the agitation for the protests (Arab
> Report and Record, 1-15 December 1968: 399).
>
> My mother, who took part in the 1971-2 student protests against Sadat,
> recalls how the Central Security Forces were beating them with sticks while
> denouncing the students as “Israeli agents.”  
>  During the 18 day uprising, a young woman journalist appeared on TV
> “confessing” she was trained by the Mossad to foment those “riots” in
> Tahrir. And of course it turned out to be a big lie.
>
> And now, the government has announced it caught another Israeli spy
> gathering information about the protests and fomented chaos with the intent
> “of harming political, economic and social interests and negatively
> impacting the course of the revolution”… and “prosecutors suspect he paid
> protesters to cause friction with the military and to foment Muslim-
> Christian tensions.”
>
> Seriously what a soap opera.

El-Hamalawy believes that such move was made by the intelligence agency in
order to prevent people from criticizing the Army in the future:

> By this latest case, the Mukhabarrat [Intelligence Agency] is trying to pull
> together a cheap move, so that any public criticism against the military
> would be depicted immediately as the work of Israeli spies. More
> importantly, the Mukhabarrat is trying to convince the public it’s a vital
> agency, in charge of protecting the country of any “foreign plots”, so as
> not to receive the same treatment as State Security Police.  
>  …  
>  Dear Mukhabarrat, stop treating us like children. Who the hell is this
> Israeli super agent who will single handedly go around fomenting protests,
> agitating against the army in the streets and mosques? Get a life, grow up.

The reactions on Twitter were not any different. In fact they went further to
mock the whole news and they created a hashtag for it,
#[ElGasoos](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23ElGasoos) (i.e. The Spy).

@[mand0z](http://twitter.com/#!/mand0z/statuses/80396996753633280): Nobody in
Mosad knows how to use YouTube, that's why they sent a spy

@[Gue3bara](http://twitter.com/#!/Gue3bara/status/80227216654475264): بعد

The Spy behind Omar Suleiman – Photo taken from the We are Sorry Mr. Spy
Facebook group

In the early days of the revolution a Facebook group was made by Mubarak
supporters under the name ‘We are Sorry Mr. President’, and since then
whenever people want to mock anything they create a Facebook group with the
‘We are Sorry…’ naming style, and ‘[We are sorry Mr.
Spy](https://www.facebook.com/pages/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B3/180812731974281)‘
wasn't any different here.

Also the fact that Ilan Grapel had a public [Facebook
profile](http://www.facebook.com/ilan.grapel) with all his information, his
photos in Tahrir Square and different other places in Egypt, made people on
Twitter more suspicious and they wondered if real spies are that naive.

> @[RAbdellatif](http://twitter.com/#!/RAbdellatif/status/80029390175617024):
> Excuse my skepticism, but would #Israel send a spy who was in their army AND

> @[NohaAtef](http://twitter.com/#!/NohaAtef/status/80345913222111232): A spy

Away from all this mockery, and away from [those who are saying
[Ar]](http://twitter.com/#!/moftasa/status/80026567606157312) that Israel
needn't any spies when they already had the likes of Mubarak and the likes of
the IMF here, some do believe that the spy story might be true. Some others
are blaming the revolution for all this fiasco.

> @[mrrizkallah](http://twitter.com/#!/mrrizkallah/status/80025136102776833):
> What if we're wrong? and he is a real spy?

@[Gemyhood](http://twitter.com/#!/Gemyhood/status/80033613193809921): سواق
التاكس فرحان جدا بالقبض على الجاسوس بيقولى شوفت يا باشا اهى المظاهرات دى
والثورة كلها شغل اسرائيل

@[Gemyhood](http://twitter.com/#!/Gemyhood/status/80033613193809921): A taxi
driver was so pleased with the arrest of the spy, and was telling me: see,
those demonstrations and the whole revolution is an Israeli thing.

Zeinobia also shares the same point of view with @mrrizkallah, and [criticized
those who are making fun of the story in her
blog](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2011/06/spy-in-our-
revolution.html).

And finally, Sama Habeeb tweeted…
