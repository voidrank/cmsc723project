After almost five months of protracted negotiations and political bickering,
Lebanon's Hezballah-led March 8 alliance finally announced a new exclusively
male, 30-minister government to be headed by Sunni billionaire Najib Mikati.

[_Qifa Nabki_](http://qifanabki.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/0613-lebanon_s-
new-cabinet.pdf) has provided a list of the new cabinet ministers, as well as
a breakdown per political and sect affiliation.

The new Beirut government has, however, already run into obstacles, with two
ministers
[reportedly](http://www.arabmonitor.info/news/dettaglio.php?idnews=34166&lang=en)
resigning only hours after the formation of the cabinet.

[[View the story “Resignation” on
Storify]](http://storify.com/antissa/resignation2) Hezballah and its
predominantly Christian allies triggered a
[collapse](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/19/lebanon-deja-vu-as-
country-plunges-into-crisis-again/) of the previous unity government led by
Saad Al-Hariri in January 2011. The Hezballah initiated move was motivated by
a deep concern that Hezballah members were to be indicted by the United
Nation's Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) in the assassination of former
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, Saad's father. The Syrian-backed March 8
alliance successfully enticed Druze leader Walid Jumblatt to renounce his
allegiance to Hariri's March 14 bloc, providing Hezballah and its allies with
the necessary numbers to form a majority government without its March 14
rivals. Despite gaining sufficient numbers to form cabinet on its own, the
March 8 alliance struggled through five months of internal wrangling over who
to allocate which cabinet seats and portfolios. Dismay was also expressed at
the exclusion of women in the new government, with all cabinet posts awarded
to men, and thus, attracting accusations of Lebanese politics as an exclusive
gentleman's club: [[View the story “No female representation” on

blogged his disappointment at the exclusion of women from the new government:

Indeed, the announcement of a new government evoked little enthusiasm amongst
Lebanese bloggers, most of whom have long been disenchanted with the country's
inefficient political elite.

[_Karl reMarks_](http://karlremarks.blogspot.com/2011/06/cabinet-of-
curiosities-is-lebanon.html) analysed the latest development, however, as a
significant shift from consensual to majoritarian politics, with the new March
8 government abandoning the previous national unity model between all major
parties in the country.

Whether this provides Lebanon with greater governance remains to seen. _Karl
reMarks_ certainly is not optimistic about any short-term prospects, but the
evolution from consensual to majoritarian politics is, nevertheless, a
progressive move worth noting:

> I called this ‘the Cabinet of Curiosities’ because in many ways it breaks

> system and the failure of March 8 to offer a solid programme of governance.
> The unequal number of Sunni and Shiite minsters is one of those

It is equally impossible to discuss a new development in Lebanese politics
without referring to the main patron, Syria.

The [latest turmoil in
Syria](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/syria-protest-2011/) has
kept Lebanon's key political players on edge, and several commentators in the
blogosphere offered their observations on Syria's role in the formation of the
new Lebanese government, beginning with _[_Karl
reMarks_](http://karlremarks.blogspot.com/2011/06/cabinet-of-curiosities-is-
lebanon.html)_ :

> With the visible decline of the Syrian regime’s authority at home and
> abroad, it’s worth considering what this statement actually means. Had the
> Syrian regime really considered the formation of the cabinet a priority, why
> did the process take so long among a group made up exclusively of its

Reader comments on [_Qifa Nabki's_](http://qifanabki.com/2011/06/13/lebanons-
new-government/) blog post on the new government have also largely focused on
the implications of the turmoil in Syria:

The formation of Lebanon's new government comes at a crucial time as the
Syrian turmoil shows no signs of abating. Lebanon's political life is largely
dependent on the power that sits in Damascus. Should that power become
unstable, Lebanon's government will face an impossible challenge of preventing
a ripple effect in the tiny, divided country.
