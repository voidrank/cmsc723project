Images appearing on Japanese TV on October 16th of [government forces evicting
crying nursery school
children](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/10/17/japan-children-in-tears-
over-potato-fields-net-users-suspicious/) from potato fields in Osaka, part of
plans to extend a highway (the [Second Keihan
Highway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Keihan_Highway)) between Kyoto
and Osaka, has sparked many on the Japanese net to respond with accusations of
media bias. [Kitasumoto Nursery](http://www2.kickoff.or.jp/~kick-
off/enter/index.html) [ja] in
[Kadoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadoma,_Osaka), who once owned the
fields but had them forcefully expropriated by the Osaka prefecture
government, [had plans for the end of October to dig up potatoes that had been
planted in May of this year](http://www.j-cast.com/2008/10/17028831.html)
[ja]. The face-to-face confrontation that ensued, with nursery teachers and
children on one side and government forces sent in to evacuate the area on the
other, had all the elements of a made-for-TV drama. Osaka Governor [Tōru
Hashimoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dru_Hashimoto) has claimed that
the children's tears were used as a ploy in the confrontation.

There are of course differences of opinion regarding the construction of the
Second Keihan Highway,  
but even if you are going to protest about it, there are better ways to do it.

Governer Hashimoto sometimes does things that make me think, “Huh?”,  
but in this case I support him 100%.  
Looking around the net, it seems that there are many people voicing support
for him there as well.

At _tantei-tiu_ , another blogger [makes a similar
observation](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/tantei-

> このニュース、最初にテレビで見たんですが  
>  まあ、橋下さんも酷いことするなぁ。と思ったもんです。

I saw this news first on TV, and thought to myself, wow, [Governor] Hashimoto
is doing terrible things.

> でも、いろいろ見てると、なんかそうでもないみたいですね。  
>  保育園側が悪いような・・・。  
>  なんて思うようになってしまいました。

But looking around, that doesn't really seem to be the case.  
Seems like it's the nursery school that's in the wrong…  
that's what I'm starting to think.

> ってかね、報道の仕方に問題があるように思えますね。

Or I should say, it's in the way [this story] has been covered that there are
problems.

> ニュースで伝えたときは、まるで大阪府側が理不尽に立ち退きを要求するような伝え方しかしなかったし、「何故立ち退きを要求されたのか」についても軽く触れた程度でしかない。  
>  まさにマスコミと所有者側が、大阪府と橋本知事をメディアと言う力で嵌めているとしか思えない伝え方に聞こえる。

When it was broadcast in the news, it was made to look as if the eviction
demand by the Osaka prefectural government was unreasonable, and [the question
of] “why have they demanded that they be evicted?” only received minor
attention.  
The way the story is being portrayed, one has to imagine that the mass media
and the owners are using the power of the media to pigeonhole the Osaka
prefectural government and governor Hashimoto.

> 俺がこのニュースで浮かんだ疑問としては、何故立ち退きが分かっている土地で、作物を植えたのかいうことである。  
>  普通ならそんなところは避けるし、俺ならば別の土地を探して借りる。  
>  結局は行政潰しの計画的な謀略としか言えないので、幼稚園側を擁護する気は皆無。

The question that came to my mind when watching this news was, why were they
planting produce in land that they knew would have to be vacated?  
Normally, you would avoid a place like that, if it were me I would look for
another plot of land to rent.  
In the end, I can only see this as some kind of systematic strategy to destroy
the administration, and so I have no interest in defending the nursery school.

[ja] of “authority trampling over children's spirits” as presented in news
reports:

> 本当にそうですか？府が用地買収を開始したのは平成15年と言います。府と保育園が5年間かけた結果が子供達を泣かすことですか？少なくとも野菜の植え付け時期に保育園側は、こうなることは予見できたはずです。その畑に何故イモを植えたのですか？仮に予見できなかったとして、保育園が行政代執行の通知を受け取ってからの10日間、いったい何をしていたのですか？

Is this really true? The prefectural government says that it began its
acquisition of the site back in 2003. Is a result that the prefectural
government and the nursery school [worked out] over 5 years something that
should make children cry? At the very least, the nursery school could have
foreseen that this would happen during the period that it was planting
vegetables. Why did they plant potatoes in those fields? Even if we suppose
that they could not have predicted what would happen, what in the world was
the nursery school doing in the ten days after they were notified about the
eviction?

In a popular post on the topic, blogger KoshianX analyzes an article on the
topic [published in
Sankei](http://sankei.jp.msn.com/politics/local/081016/lcl0810161139000-n1.htm)
[ja] and [makes a similar

> この記事がいろいろひどいと思った。何がひどいって大阪府がいたいけな子供を泣かせてるというストーリーで書かれてて、あまりに一方的すぎて素直に読めば「橋本知事ひどい!」になるし、うがって見れば「保育園あやしい政治団体みたいだな」になりがち。

I found this article horrible in so many ways. The reason I felt this way is
that the story that is written here, about the Osaka prefectural government as
making innocent children cry, is just too one-sided; if you take it as it is
written, you just have to think, “Governer Hashimoto is horrible!”, but if you
dig deeper, you come out [thinking], “This nursery school seems just like a
suspicious political organization.”

Looking at the bratty kids in the video, I thought the government made the
right decision.

Others questioned the moves by the daycare:

What are they doing in the first place planting fields in a place where there
will be such confusion going on?

>  随分前から通知されえてるはずだが

Seriously, why didn't they dig up the potatoes two weeks ahead of schedule?  
They were notified about [what was going to happen] a while ago.

Finally, one commenter makes a suggestion:

> 14 名前： ９条教徒(鹿児島県) ：2008/10/16(木) 11:53:57.68 ID:F9qMgyq7  
>  芋買ってきて別の畑に埋めて子供に掘らせればいいんじゃね？

Couldn't they have just bought some potatoes, planted them in a different
field and had the children dig those up?
