Muslims around the world are marking [Eid Al
Adha](http://www.answers.com/Eid%20Al%20Adha), a religious festival which
marks the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son to Allah and the end of
the[ Hajj](http://www.answers.com/Hajj) pilgrimage to Mecca. Iraqi bloggers
seem to be united and are in no mood for celebration.

Iraqi [_Layla Anwar_](http://arabwomanblues.blogspot.com/2008/12/another-
eid.html) says she doesn't find a reason for celebration. She writes:

> You know something, I have stopped celebrating holidays, special occasions
> and the rest…  
>  What I mean is that my festivities are kept to a strict minimum.  
>  I don't do anything for the Eid, neither for Christmas. However, my family
> keeps the Eid tradition alive and I comply.

[_Baghdad Dentist_](http://baghdadentist.blogspot.com/2008/12/eid-in-
baghdad.html) was out and about and updates us about Eid in Baghdad, where he
writes about family visits and attending weddings, which are only marred by
the fact that there is a war in the background. He adds:

> .at about 6p.m. i went to the wedding party of our neighbour. it was a nice
> one.every one was dancing and laughing. i saw many boys and girls who grew
> up. my sister's family stayed,the next day we went to manny neighborhoods in
> baghdad just hanging over. at night we went to Al-Rubei'y street. i like it
> because the shops are great and its the only one without concrete barriers
> on pavements and the people their are more motivated than other where you
> find trush,concrete barriers,just like chaos!!.there were horrible traffic
> jams everywhere bcoz of the checkpoints.

Another blogger [_Faiza Al
Arji_](http://afamilyinbaghdad.blogspot.com/2008/12/blog-post.html) discusses
the spiritual significance of Eid. She says:

عندما كنت صغيرة , كنت اظن ان العيد هو فقط ملابس جديدة وحلوى وزيارة الاقارب او
مدينة الالعاب ,  
والى  
عهد قريب من حياتي بقيت افكر ان العيد هو فقط طقوس دنيويه مثل ترتيب البيت  
وشراء شكولاته وحلويات وعصير للضيوف والذهاب للصالون حتى اقص شعري وارتب  
مظهري وشراء ملابس جديدة لافراد العائله جميعهم
