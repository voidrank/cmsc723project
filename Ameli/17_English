A state-of-the-art execution machine designed by @Ternz to help Egypt execute
529 Muslim Brotherhood supporters

Egypt today [March 24] sentenced 529 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death
for their roles in violent riots in Minya, in Upper Egypt, last August.

The riots broke out following a crackdown on sit-ins in support of ousted
president Mohammed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, which left hundreds of
supporters dead.

The Minya riots left one police officer dead – a crime all 529 defendants are
accused of.

In Egypt, the sentence, one of the largest death sentences in modern history,
was both rebuked or lauded, depending on which end of the political spectrum
the reactions came from. Mada Masr tallies up reactions [here](

conviction).

Egyptian blogger Zeinobia says this sentence, for which a final verdict is due
to be issued on April 28, breaks a new world record.

She [explains]( http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2014/03/another-world-
record-we-achieved.html):

> We got the highest number of HCV [Hepatitis C] patients in the world , we
> got the highest rate of sexual harassment in the world and today we broke a
> record in a mass-death sentence by a court in one single case !!  
>  I am speaking about the historical court rule of Minya criminal court
> against 529 defendants , yup the one which the whole world is speaking
> about.

Zeinobia adds:

> I will speak about fact here :
>
> 529 defendants were sentenced to death and 15 were acquitted in the Rabaa
> dispersal aftermath in Minya trial.  
>  139 were detained in the case while the rest were either released on bail
> or on the run.  
>  Only 51 defendants attended the trial because the space could not hold more
> defendants.  
>  The trial started on Saturday and ended on Monday.  
>  The lawyers of the defendants demanded to replace the Judges panel but
> their request was rejected.  
>  The lawyers of the defendants “not in absentia” were not allowed to defend
> their defendants !!  
>  The 529 defendants are accused of killing deputy Sheriff Mostafa El Attar
> of Matay Police Station !!  
>  This is the biggest mass death sentence in the history of Egyptian
> judiciary.

Egypt-based journalist Bel Trew wonders:

> Can't imagine how you would even hang 529 people.If it just took 5 mins to
> hang 1 person that's over 44 hours of continuous slaughter

And Egyptian @Ternz, who admits to starting to draw cartoons only two weeks
ago, has come up with a solution: a state-of-the-art execution machine.

He explains [ar]:

> اساعدها..؟؟ مسكت قلم وبدأت أصمم جهاز مصر محتاجاه في الفترة دي..-1

> While I was sitting in a relaxed state of mind, I asked myself: How can I
> best serve my country? How can I benefit it and help it? So I took a pen and
> designed a machine Egypt needs in this phase

And here's his masterpiece:

> إسهاماً مني في تنفيذ أحكام الإعدام بكفاءة..اتمني جهازي دي يلقى اهتمام
> المسؤلين ..و دي قمة الإعدام العلمي…

Meanwhile, UK-based journalist Inigo Gilmore concludes:
