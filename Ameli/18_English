> 我們來了，夏天也來了  
>  我們的腳步，可以溫柔也可以堅定  
>  我們的聲音，可以優美也可以嘶啞  
>  我們的拳頭，可以揮向天空也可以揮向不義  
>  我們的心，可以是血的紅也可以是青草的綠  
>  我們越過圍牆佔領這條街、這個廣場、這個堡壘  
>  當別人把這裡當作提款機、當作傳聲筒、當作逃生梯  
>  我們把這裡當作溫暖的搖籃，當作哺育稻米的農田，當作未來之歌的錄音間  
>  我們歌唱，對，我們歌唱  
>  我們用歌唱佔領一個原該屬於我們的國家，原該保護我們的政府，原該支持我們生存的殿堂  
>  把它從墳墓變成子宮，從垃圾堆變成果園，從地獄變成天堂  
>  甚至我們不奢求天堂，我們垂下眼睛，把這裡當作自己的家  
>  今夜，原不相識的你我，在這裡多元成家  
>  今夜，我們甘願做愛的暴民  
>  就像五二０訴願農民那樣的暴民  
>  就像六四天安門學生那樣的暴民  
>  就像把美麗島當號角的那樣的暴民  
>  就像用野百合、用茉莉花改變世界的那樣的暴民  
>  就像以自焚為武器的鄭南榕那樣的暴民  
>  不過今夜，我們不焚燒自己  
>  我們焚燒這嚴寒的冬夜  
>  讓夏天一夜之間，來到我們眼前！

> We are coming, when the summer is coming  
>  Our footsteps can be soft, our footsteps can be firm  
>  Our sounds can be beautiful, our sounds can be hoarse  
>  Our fists can be raised up toward the sky, our fists can be raised up
> against injustice  
>  Our hearts can be as red as blood, our hearts can be as green as the grass  
>  When we cross the wall and occupy this street, this square and this
> fortress  
>  When others consider this place an ATM, a megaphone, or a fire escape  
>  We consider this place a warm cradle, a rice field and a recording room for
> our future songs  
>  We sing, yes, we sing  
>  We sing to occupy a country that is supposed to belong to us  
>  We sing to occupy a government that is supposed to protect us  
>  We sing to occupy a palace that is supposed to support our living  
>  We transform it from a tomb into a womb, from a trash pile into a fruit
> garden, from a hell into a paradise  
>  Paradise might sound too luxurious  
>  We lower our eyelids and would like to consider this place home for us  
>  Tonight, strangers like you and I become a diverse family  
>  Tonight, we are willing to be violent mobs for love  
>  Like those farmers protesting on May 20*  
>  Like those students standing in Tiananmen Square on June 4**  
>  Like those holding Formosa as their horns***  
>  Like those violent mobs changing the world with the wild lily† and
> jasmine††  
>  Like Cheng Nan-Jung††† using self-immolation as a weapon  
>  But tonight, we do not burn ourselves  
>  We light up this extremely cold winter night  
>  So that summer will come to us by next dawn
