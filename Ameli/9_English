Palestinians say it is raining fire in Gaza, after Israel started [ground
operations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/07/17/breaking-israel-begins-
ground-operations-in-gaza/) into the besieged enclave tonight.

Home to about 1.7 million Palestinians, Gaza is bordered by Israel on one side
and Egypt on another. Both borders are heavily controlled, leaving residents
with nowhere to run. Critics of Israel's occupation have described Gaza as an
open-air prison.

On Twitter, Jehan Alfarra, with 8K followers, says:

Today is the 11th day of the start of “Operation Defensive Edge,” which has
left more than 230 Palestinians dead, including women and children, and more
than 1,500 injured.

From Gaza, Hamas, which has ruled the strip since 2007, has [fired
missiles](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israel-launches-major-operation-
against-hamas-in-gaza-
strip/2014/07/08/81874d52-067a-11e4-a0dd-f2b22a257353_story.html) into Israel.
Most of the rockets coming into Israel have caused no serious damage, due in
part to the US-funded Iron Dome aerial defense system, [which has intercepted
at least 70 projectiles so
far,](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/israeli-air-strikes-gaza-
continue-us-barack-obama-offers-broker-ceasefire) according to the Guardian.

With the group operations, the casualties are expected to rise.
