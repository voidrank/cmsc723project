A frame from the Youtube version of the film “Looking at the Cobblestones.”

A Serbian NGO has [published
online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw3OAaufvpY) the entire documentary
film “Looking at the Cobblestones” about the impact of a 1951 law forbidding
the covering of women's faces with Muslim veils
([niqāb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq%C4%81b)) in the then-People's
Republic of Serbia.

The film published by the [Novi
Pazar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Pazar) NGO Academic Initiative Forum
10 features interviews with senior citizens who witnessed the law's
implementation, and who talk about the hard life in the [Sandžak
region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand%C5%BEak) right after the
devastation following World War II.

A group of younger interviewees talk about contemporary issues affecting
Muslim women taking into account this historical perspective.

According to the film's authors:

> Zakon je donet kako se navodu u njegovom obrazloženju „u cilju da se otkloni
> vekovna oznaka potčinjenosti i zaostalosti žene muslimanke, da se olakša
> ženi muslimanki puno korišćenje prava izvojevanih u Narodno – oslobodilačkoj
> borbi i socijalističkoj izgradnji zemlje i da joj se obezbedi puna
> ravnopravnost i učešće u društvenom, kulturnom i privrednom životu“

> The law was adopted with the explanation “..to achieve the goal of removing
> the century-old sign of subjugation and backwardness of of Muslim women, and
> to enable Muslim women to fully use the rights won during the Struggle for
> Liberation of the People and the Socialist renewal of the country, and to
> enable equal rights and participation in the social, cultural and economic
> life.”

The
[Yugoslav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia)
authorities’ actions mirrored [Atatürk's
Reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_Reforms) in Turkey,
which were epitomised by the Law Relating to Prohibited Garments passed in
1934.

Prior to official state action in Yugoslavia, Muslim members of the Women's
Antifascist Front had prepared the ground with grassroots manifestations of
public uncoverings of their own faces.

The earliest such events took place in Kosovo in 1947. Possibly through
coordination at federal level, the constituent republics adopted anti-veil
laws around the same time — Bosnia in September 1950, Serbia and
[Macedonia](http://www.slvesnik.com.mk/Issues/60DAF6C0635947D7A2105B98320D25C4.pdf)
in January 1951.

While the Communist Party encouraged atheism among its members, the elite of
Yugoslav society, the state guaranteed freedom of religion to all other
citizens.

In [an essay about the law against the veil](http://<a href=), [Prof. Fikret
Karčić](http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/people/fikret-karcic) explained
that the campaign against the veil was based on the notion that the covering
of women is not grounded in religion, but in customs that go beyond religious
norms.

The state-endorsed message was that rejecting traditional attire does not make
one less Muslim.

The post-war Yugoslav Communist government brought about legal changes
elevating the status of women, including the right to vote, work and hold
property, while adopting a [pro-
choice](https://globalvoices.org/2015/12/29/activists-seek-to-dispel-abortion-
stigma-fueled-by-the-macedonian-governments-policies/) stance towards
abortion.

However, activist [Ms Zibija Šarenkapić
Dervišhalitović](http://www.mc.rs/fotografija-zibija-sarenkapic-
dervishalitovic.1966.html?photoId=38008) explains in the film that the state
actually avoided directly confronting entrenched patriarchal power structures.

Instead, patriarchy simply came from a different source — the state — which
threatened non-conforming women with heavy fines.

Forced uncovering was deeply disturbing to some women.

Mr Asim Nikšić, who was a child in 1951, explains that as a way to cope with
the trauma his widowed mother simply stayed indoors for eight months.

The title of the film “Looking at the Cobblestones” is an idiom meaning
“hanging your head in shame,” describing how some women felt overexposed when
outside of their homes.

Before the filming, Academic Initiative Forum 10 director Fahrudin Kladničanin
[explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMZO9Lz7BLs) that the project is
based on archive research and
[testimonies](http://sandzakpress.net/ispovijesti-sandzackih-zena-nakon-
prisilnog-skidanja-zara-i-feredze-1951-godine), and the intent of the NGO is
to offer “a new reading” of forgotten historical events and engage the public
in discussion by giving a voice to the women and others who were directly
affected.
