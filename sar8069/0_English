Child abuse at a private nursery in Beijing and the accompanying censorship of
news and commentary surrounding the case has many Chinese criticizing
authorities and skeptical of police conclusions.

On November 22, eight parents filed a complaint with Beijing police that their
children were being harmed by staff at a kindergarten run by an education
group called Red-Yellow-Blue (RYB).

According to local [media reports](https://www.letscorp.net/archives/125596),
the parents found needle holes in their children's bodies. Some of the
children [said](https://www.letscorp.net/archives/125504) they were fed white
powder by the teachers, and one child claimed that they were bought into a
room for body inspections performed by a naked doctor. Allegedly, at least
three children were punished with standing naked in class, and one showed
physical marks that could imply sexual molestation.

The news was explosive on social media. On November 22 and 23, a group of
enraged parents gathered outside the kindergarten demanding explanations and
surveillance videos. The police then started the investigation.

Censorship soon followed. The once hot topic all but disappeared from social
media. Netizens, however, continued to discuss the case in more private
channels such as chat rooms, with many expressing concern that the police
would not dig deep while investigating the established education group.

This is not the first time the education group has faced accusations of child
abuse. [In 2015](https://www.letscorp.net/archives/125596), needle spots were
found on the bodies of at least 17 toddlers in another kindergarten run by RYB
in Jilin province. Four teachers there were subsequently arrested.

### Censorship, “false” accusations and rumor-mongering

On November 25, Beijing Chaoyang district police
[announced](https://www.weibo.com/5556545776/FwJGGuETj?from=page_1001065556545776_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime)
on Weibo that they had
[arrested](https://www.weibo.com/5556545776/FwJHCEycQ?from=page_1001065556545776_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime)
one 22-year-old teacher — as well as a Beijing resident who commented on
social media about the connection between the headmaster of the nursery with a
military clan stationed near Beijing.

On November 28, the district police further [reported
that](https://www.weibo.com/5556545776/FxdMw5tP0?from=page_1001065556545776_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime)
there was no evidence of drugs being fed to children nor of sexual
molestation. The parents, police said, admitted to making false accusations or
coaching their children to provide false testimony about standing naked as
punishment or drug consumption.

However, the police also said that the hard disk of the surveillance footage
from the kindergarten was broken because the electrical supply to the video
surveillance set had been unplugged frequently for a lengthy period of time.
The police managed to recover 113 hours of recorded footage.

Under the police updates posted on Weibo, the majority of the comments praise
the work of authorities and condemn rumormongers.

Nevertheless, despite the censorship, critical remarks about the investigation
continue to pop up on Weibo. One netizen summed up the message of the police
updates in a few bullet points:

> 1.孩子没事，2.老师脾气不好，3.视频坏了，4.家长无聊，借孩子搞事情，5.网友都被孩子和家长骗了，6.网友不要造谣，不然抓人。

> 1\. The kids are OK; 2. Teachers are mad [they needled the kids because they
> refused to sleep]; 3. The surveillance camera's hard disk is broken; 4.
> Parents are using the kids to create a mess; 5. Netizens and the kids were
> both tricked by the parents; 6. Netizens should stop spreading rumors or
> they will be arrested.

China introduced the online [rumor law](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-
china-internet/china-threatens-tough-punishment-for-online-rumor-spreading-
idUSBRE9880CQ20130909) in 2013. Netizens who distribute unverified information
would be arrested and charged with spreading rumor if their posts have been
viewed for 5000 times or shared for 500 times. The maximum jail time is three
years.

Another Weibo user slammed the police report and censorship of online
comments:

>
> 新浪刚推出来的朝阳分局的调查结果，立马点进去看，所以这调查结果就是一切都是家长造谣，抹黑，无中生有？呵呵，多么可怕，或许这就是社会，背后的势力或许是我们不能想象的。  
>  短短几分钟，评论上千，全是质问，一眨眼功夫 ，评论全部被删，关闭评论！！这样就会没有质疑的声音了吗？  
>  警方带走了能证明事实全部监控，一句监控视频损坏，就当没有发生过任何事？真是可笑至极。

> Sina just reported on the investigation of Chaoyang district police. I read

>  In a matter of a few minutes, thousands of questions popped up underneath

>  Criticism can be erased like this?

> This is such a joke.

To highlight the inconsistencies within the police report, “broken hard disk”
became a hashtag on social media.

A technical piece pointed out that all the kindergarten surveillance cameras
were connected to a central system which would alert the government education
authorities if the surveillance cameras were not functioning. But the article
was censored.

Another censored piece put together all available news reports on other
unrelated cases in which police investigations reported that surveillance
cameras or their associated hard disks at the scene of the alleged crime
weren't working. Inevitably, majority of the cases ended up with the same
conclusion that there were no evidence supporting the allegations.

Netizens made jokes about the hard disk and one widely circulated cartoon
showed a hard disk hanging itself (see image on the right.)

### Education business is booming, but who's looking out for the children?

The welfare of children in kindergarten has become a hot issue in China, where
[a string of abuse cases](http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-
news-42107346) has revealed loose regulation and supervision in the childcare
and early learning industry.

This time, the kindergarten involved is run by RYB, a high-end private
education group that went public in the US stock market in September 2017. It
targets China's emerging middle-class families and features school fees as
much as 5,000 yuan (750 US dollars) a month for bilingual education. Yet, the
incident reveals that spending that much money doesn't guarantee that children
are protected from abuse.

Massive capital has poured into China’s early education industry; it's
projected to be [a 348-billion-yuan market by 2020 with 20% average growth
annually](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-06/16/content_29766305.htm),
after China abolished one-child policy in 2015. However, rapid expansion has
led to cutting corners — such as hiring unlicensed teachers — to increase
profit or overstretched budgets.

RYB is a typical case of the expanding sector. [Founded in
1999](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BA%A2%E9%BB%84%E8%93%9D%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2),
the group opened its first private kindergarten in 2001 and has built a
reputation as the leading education institute providing the best quality early
education. After obtaining a franchise license in 2013, by June 2017 the group
owned 853 play and learning centers and 225 nurseries, and planned to further
operate 724 pre-school institutions all over the country. RYB's revenue mainly
comes from franchise fees.

It doesn't seem like any of the industry-wide problems are getting much
attention following the latest case, as the focus has been placed on the
individuals involved. As Twitter @wyjaaa sarcastically commented:

> 硬盘坏了，监控没了，无证幼师认罪了，仓库保安招供了，家长情绪稳定了，承认造谣的就要上央视忏悔了，恭喜红蓝黄股价暴涨了，低端人口可以庆祝盛世中华了…
