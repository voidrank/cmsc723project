Aarav Appukuttan and Sukanyeah Krishna are in love. The transgender couple —
Appukuttan was designated female at birth, and Krishna was designated male —
met at a doctor's clinic while in a hospital awaiting gender reassignment
surgery in [India's financial
capital,](https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/36804494/indian-transgender-
couple-announce-plan-to-marry-adopt/) Mumbai, three years ago. A romance soon
bloomed based on their shared passion for advocacy and struggles with gender
identity, and they decided to get married.

News of their plans to wed and eventually adopt children made headlines around
the world, but their joy over the international solidarity became tinged with
anxiety after receiving [death threats](http://www.mid-
day.com/articles/couple-sex-change-operation-mumbai-death-threats-abuse-
national-news/18538199) on social media. After lodging official complaints
with the police, the couple tried to move on with their advocacy. They also
sought help via crowdfunding for their surgeries, but they received more
negative feedback and trolling. This came through various channels including
Facebook, where threats of violence and hate speech are
[prohibited](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards), but [not always
removed](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-
internal-documents-algorithms) by the company.

The couple then decided to take down their crowdfunding campaign. Sukanyeah

In 2014, India's Supreme Court
[declared](http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/04/supreme-courts-third-gender-
status-to-transgenders-is-a-landmark/) transgender people a “third gender”, a
ruling that protects their access to education and employment. Nevertheless,
stigma remains and transgender people are often targets of harassment and
attacks, or are even forced to beg or engage in prostitution for survival.
According to a survey of 2,169 transgender people by [Swasti Health Resource
Centre](http://swasti.org/), four in 10 transgender people in India have
experienced sexual abuse by the time they reached puberty.

This reality has led people like Aarav and Sukanyeah to [fight
back](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/01/07/4-in-10-trans-people-in-india-
subjected-to-violence-before-they-reach-18-years-old/). Global Voices spoke to
the couple in a telephonic interview. Below is a brief transcript.

**Global Voices (GV): You have received death threats on social media. How has
this affected you?**

> **Sukanyeah** : We've received varied responses from people. While some are
> super appreciative others have issued threats saying, “Kill the LGBT dogs”
> on Facebook. I don't now why we are being targeted but it's very similar to
> the transphobia and homophobia that triggered the [Orlando
> massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting) [in
> the United States in 2016]. People think we are outcasts or aliens but we
> are not the ones creating problems. We just keep to ourselves and still face
> attacks. They don't know anything about us, gender identity disorder yet
> they read headlines and abuse us. It hurts us and demeans our struggle to a
> greater extent.
>
> In fact, now, we are even scared to publish our wedding dates and our
> security will get compromised. We are poor and we don't know how to handle
> goons if they threaten us so our best chance is to get a private wedding
> ceremony done.
>
> This negative feedback is forcing us to hide. It takes a lot of courage to
> come out in the first place and accept your identity.

> **Aarav** : We have filed complaints against a few accounts on social media
> for issuing death threats against us. Most of them are fake and based out of
> Kerala. We try and be as polite as possible in our responses but sometimes,
> it's just hard to be kinder when they want to end our lives and it is
> disturbing.

**GV: And what about the positive responses?**

> **Aarav** : We are happy, we have received a positive response from everyone
> across the world except some miscreants locally. We are happy people are
> trying to understand our situation and it gives out a bigger and much
> significant message of acceptance of the gender-identity disorders.

**GV: What is the plan for the wedding? Do you expect any legal hassles?**

> **Aarav:** We don't expect any legal hassles from our marriage under India's
> article 377 as we both are legally male and female now. Officially, we have
> received our government documents as well and are waiting for more documents
> before we can solemnize our marriage.

**GV: How did you meet?**

> **Aarav** : We met three years ago outside at a doctors clinic where
> Sukanyeah had come for her treatment. I heard her talking in
> [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam) and that's how we
> started talking. My family is supportive of our union.

**GV: What are your future plans?**

> **Aarav** : We want to start a non-governmental organization for members of
> the transgender community and want to create awareness among parents. They
> should not ignore their children dealing with gender dysphoria or gender
> identity disorder. They should instead support them and we hope we can set
> some example. We are hopeful parents will reach out to us and seek our
> counseling.

> **Sukanyeah** : My family disowned me when I was young and let me down
> because I was a transgender. I faced many troubles and left home at 18 to
> work in Bangalore and save money for my surgeries. I worked in call centers,
> worked as a freelance in Information Technology sector and started my
> hormonal treatment to transition into a woman. That's when my relationship
> with Aarav blossomed and I don't think seeking support from my family will
> yield anything positive. I was heartbroken at their rejection but now plan
> to focus all my energies on starting a non-governmental organization by
> December to aid other trans individuals.

**GV: How do you summarise your journey?**

> **Aarav** : After 45 years of hiding behind a woman's mask, I am finally
> free to live my life as a man and don't take those seriously who want to
> insult or mock me. Also, I would want to advise those opting for surgeries
> to go to a renowned doctor instead of falling for botched surgeries which
> are more dangerous.

**GV: What about starting a family?**

> **Both Aarav and Sukanyeah:** We want a child to complete our family and
> inspire us to do good for the world and I am sure we will make wonderful
> parents.
