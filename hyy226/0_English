Thirteen Hong Kong primary school students won awards in a government
competition celebrating the 20th anniversary of the city’s handover to China
on April 14.

Sovereignty over Hong Kong was transferred from the United Kingdom of Great
Britain to China on 1 of July 1997.

Receiving over 3,000 submissions from December to February, the theme of the
poster competition was “When I’m 20.” Children were asked to design a poster
to share their thoughts of what life will be like when they enter their 20s.
Secondary school students and members of the public were also invited to film
videos on the theme of “togetherness.”

HKFP’s picks from the poster collection:

_Love Hong Kong Build Hong Kong Co-build Hong Kong_ by __ Chan Sau-yee (see
top photo)

Eleven-year-old Chan Sau-yee won the competition with his colourful creation
imagining a city with underwater houses:

> To solve the problem of insufficient land supply, the government seeks land
> both in the urban areas and the countryside to build houses.
>
> Why not think outside the box and build a city at the bottom of the sea by
> constructing large community houses and luxury flats so that Hong Kong's
> admirers of the sea can have one more option?

_Reflections for Hong Kong People – Garbage Hong Kong_ by Lau Tsz-wang

Eleven-year-old Lau Tsz-wang won the runner-up prize with an apocalyptic
vision of the city’s future:

> In my painting, Hong Kong has become a city of garbage where the air is
> toxic and everybody has to wear an oxygen mask, whilst buildings are
> damaged…
>
> My painting is to remind people of [the importance of] environmental
> protection, not to generate garbage, so that our future would not look like
> my painting.

Third prize was won by Chu Ching-fung, who had a more optimistic view of the
city’s destiny:

> By the time I am 20, I shall be a journalist…The first Hong Kong-built space
> shuttle (Hong Kong No. 1) was launched on the date of the 30th anniversary
> as everybody cheered and felt greatly encouraged… This is what I reported on
> [the] scene.

_Be Honest and a Person of Commitment_ by Wu Lok-yi

Nine-year-old Wu Lok-yi seems to have cast a critical eye on Hong Kong’s news
events while drawing this merit-winning poster:

> When I am 20, I shall be a mature person. When I am 20, I shall be an honest
> person. When I am 20, I shall be a person with commitment. When I am 20, I
> will not be a person that schemes all the time.
>
> I will never be a dirty hypocrite as often reported in the news.

_I Would Like to be an Astronaut when I Grow Up_ by Leung Lai-man

Although the subject of 9-year-old Leung Lai-man’s poster carries a Chinese
flag, Leung says that by age 20…

> I shall be working at NASA of the US in future.
>
> I find a planet that has never been discovered before. After a while, I find
> a creature in space and I am very excited.
>
> I see the entire Milky Way in space and return to Earth after one year, a
> very long time indeed.
