Russia has a long history of Anglophilia dating back to the Victorian era.
Whilst the UK and Russia have had strained relations in the past few years,
this hasn't had much of an effect on ordinary people's opinions. Russians are
avid followers of English Premier League Football, with Roman Abramovich going
as far as to purchase Chelsea FC. Wealthy Russians have bought up so much of
London's West End that Londoners sarcastically refer to their city as
“[Londongrad](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Londongrad-Russia-Inside-Story-
Oligarchs/dp/0007356374)” or “[Moscow-on-
Thames](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/02/moscow-thames-londongrad-
yevgeny-chichvarkin).” While the UK reacted to the death of Margaret Thatcher
with [deep ambivalence](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/margaret-thatcher-s-
death-evokes-polarized-reaction-1.1360286), Russians greeted the news of the
passing of the “ _Zheleznaya Ledi_ ” or “Iron Lady” with almost uniform
commiseration.

English literature has never gone out of vogue. Doyle's ingenious detective,
an incorruptible arch-rationalist and autodidact, was adapted for the Soviet
and Russian screens numerous times, most recently in 2013, when a big budget
television series was broadcast with much fanfare (and rather dismal reviews).

It's little surprise then that many Russians, were anxiously awaiting the New
Year's Day premiere of the third series of _Sherlock,_ the widely popular BBC
adaptation that updates the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his assistant,
Dr. John Watson, to the 21st century. The series’ name in cyrillic, “Шерлок”,
began trending on twitter as more and more Russians tuned in to watch it on
Russia's Channel 1. The premiere centred on the return of the titular hero to
London following a two year absence, during which he had faked his own death
in order to dismantle the criminal empire of his arch-nemesis, Jim Moriarty.

The long-awaited episode, which had attracted much speculation amongst the
show's rabid online fanbase, sharply divided viewers. Some [were
pleased](https://twitter.com/Enimyy/status/419132122859704320) [ru] with the
show's return.

Others were less impressed. One blogger, who goes by the nom de plume “[have
gods love](http://have-gods-love.livejournal.com/)“, singled out [a litany of
reasons](http://have-gods-love.livejournal.com/163066.html) [ru] her friends
had been less than impressed with the third series’ premiere, including a
perceived overemphasis on gay themes (in one of the show's running jokes,
Watson and Holmes, two adult men living together in west London, are often
mistaken for a gay couple).

> Стон катится по френдленте: новый Шерлок не так хорош.  
>  Слишком много кривляний, слишком много стеба, слишком много внимания
> фанатам, слишком много отношений, слишком много гомосексуальной темы,
> слишком мало сюжета… Андерсон не тот, Мэри никакая…  
>  И главное – “Что-то не так. Вроде как те же и там же, но не так”.

> There's a groan echoing through my newsfeed: the new Sherlock isn't so good.  
>  Too much over-acting, too much banter, too much pandering to the fans, too
> many relationships, too much of the homosexual theme, too little plot…
> Anderson [one of Sherlock's minor rivals] isn't quite right, Where's this

Several Russian netizens announced their intention to stop watching the
series, owing to their dislike of the premiere. Nevertheless, the interest the
premiere generated demonstrates the enduring popularity of British cultural
exports in Russia. The speed with which Channel 1 had a Russian-language
localization ready for broadcast (and one which, according to one blog
dedicated to the show, [was a vast improvement](http://sherlock-
series.livejournal.com/1087314.html) [ru] on the last two series’) also shows
that Russia's demand for British entertainment continues unabated, despite
Moscow's penchant for [taking potshots](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-
politics-23984730) at the UK. Whatever Kremlin officials choose to mutter at
future international conferences, it can be safely assumed that ordinary
Russians will be ready to hang on Benedict Cumberbatch's every word.
