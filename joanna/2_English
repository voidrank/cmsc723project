Fouad Mourtada, a 26-year old IT engineer has been held under arrest in
Casablanca since February 5th for “villainous practices linked to the alleged
theft of the identity” of King Mohammed VI's younger brother, Prince Moulay
Rachid, on the popular social networking website Facebook. Fouad appeared in
court on Friday February 15th. The trial has been postponed until February 22.

[According to a statement](http://www.helpfouad.com/1001.html) released by the
Committee of Support for Fouad Mourtada, following the first visit to Fouad on
February 12th at Oukacha jail in Casablanca, Fouad provided more information
about the circumstances of the arrest and claimed he was “beaten, spat on and
insulted”:

> I was arrested on the morning of Tuesday by two individuals who embarked me
> on a vehicle then blindfolded my eyes with a black band. After about fifteen
> minutes, they changed vehicles, then took me along to some building to
> undergo an interrogation there. I was persecuted, beaten up, slapped, spat
> on and insulted. I was also slammed for hours with a tool on the head and
> the legs. This calvary lasted such a long time that I lost consciousness
> several times and also lost the notion of time. I was completely surprised
> to learn, when I was taken again to another location, that it was Wednesday.

In the same statement, Mourtada stressed that he created the Facebook account
of Prince Moulay Rachid as a joke. It's not clear how the Moroccan police
found out who was behind the account or whether there was any kind of
collaboration between Facebook and the police.

> I actually created this account on January 15, 2008. It remained online a
> few days before somebody closed it. There are so many profiles of
> celebrities on Facebook. I never thought that by creating a profile of his
> highness prince Moulay Rachid I was harming him in any way. I, as a matter
> of fact, did not send any message from that account to anyone. It was just a
> joke, a gag. I regret my gesture and beg my forgiveness from my whole family
> for the harm that I have caused them.

Fouad Mourtada could face five years in prison “ _for having done what
thousands of people throughout the world do everyday: Create a profile of a
celebrity or a star on Facebook,_ ” his [lawyer Ali Ammar
said](http://www.canadaeast.com/progress/article/213964), adding: “ _This is a
cultural problem. This is the first time that a Moroccan poses as a very
important personality on the Internet_ (…) ___This is already a common
practice in Europe and the United States._ “

Today, the Moroccan blogosphere is showing its solidarity with Fouad and his
family. Many prominent Moroccan bloggers are on strike, such as [Ibn
