To borrow a leaf from the Global voices Sub Saharan Editor's post on [cyber-
activism in the aftermath of the elections in
Kenya](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/01/15/kenya-cyberactivism-in-
the-aftermath-of-political-violence/); we take a look at how environmental
bloggers and activists are using web 2.0 tools to bring attention to issues
ranging from deforestation, conservation and global warming, and the Web 2.0
tools being used to share information, photos, videos and raise funds.

**Mashups**  
From [Ghacks](http://www.ghacks.net/2007/11/08/six-great-google-maps-
mashups/), we are directed to two environmental mashups. The first is
[Terrapass](http://www.terrapass.com/flight/flightcalc.php?submit.x=30&submit.y=11),
which helps calculate CO2 emissions from airplane travel.

> TerraPass helps you calculate your carbon footprint, learn how to reduce it,
> and balance it out through the purchase of verified carbon offsets. Carbon
> offsets are a means of funding clean energy and carbon reduction projects
> that help to fight global warming.

The second is [Floodmaps](http://flood.firetree.net/)

> With talk about sea level rising it is important to get a visual idea of
> what would happen if the sea level would rise for a certain amount of
> meters. Floodmaps simulates this by dynamically changing the map.

Via [Googlemapsmania](http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/) blog, is a pointer
to another mashup called [MapEcos](http://mapecos.org/map).

> [MapEcos](http://mapecos.org/map) is a collaborative website designed to
> provide an evenhanded view of industrial environmental performance. It
> combines information on industrial pollution with information from facility
> managers about their environmental improvement efforts. In other words,
> MapEcos is the first public website to tell both sides of the story

Mashups are being used to hyperlocalize useful information such as recycling
locations. An example of this comes from
[Ideum](http://www.ideum.com/portfolio/torrance_recycle_map), a company that
created the google maps [mashup for finding recycling centers in Torrance
California](http://recycletorrance.org/where.php).

> Where to Recycle in Torrance, California, helps city residents to easily
> find recycling centers based on the items they wish to recycle. The concept
> is simple: the easier it is to recycle, the more recycling will happen.

Another mashup to take a note of is [Explore our
planet](http://exploreourpla.net/). It uses layers over google maps to show
information about the planet, such as annual CO2 emissions by region/country
and tropical storms.  
![Annual co2 emmisions by region](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

> An advanced map interface with near realtime extensions, satellite photos
> and thousands of other maps illustrate hurricanes, tropical storms and
> earthquakes when they happen.

**Blogs and Video**  
The [wildlife direct blogs ](http://www.wildlifedirect.org/blogsList.php)are a
strong example of how to use video, audio and pictures for the environmental
causes of conservation, wildlife protection and scientific research on
endangered species. Richard Leakey, a pre-eminent conservationist records
video clips discussing matters of climate change and whaling, then [posts them
on his blog](http://www.wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/richardleakey), making
his environmental commentary accessible to all on the internet.

The education of the younger generation about conservation and the environment
is exemplified by the postings on the [Wildlife Clubs of Kenya blog
](http://wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/wildlifeclubskenya)(also part of
wildlife direct.) The mobile education unit goes out to the schools in Kenya,
showing video and conversing with children about the need for conservation and
appreciation of the natural environment. The blog [posts video of one such
visit](http://wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/wildlifeclubskenya/2007/10/30/welcome-
to-wildlife-clubs-of-kenya/), and continues to chronicle its work in Kenya.  

The Gorilla protection blog has used the internet to reach out the world with
information and updates from war torn DRC. They have also used their blog
to[raise funds](http://wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/gorilla/2007/12/12/urgent-
appeal-20k-for-fuel-wood-for-refugees/) specifically for purchasing wood fuel
for displaced people in DRC. The success of their appeal is shown by a [post
on the 18th](http://wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/gorilla/2008/01/18/20k-of-
fuel-wood-ready-for-distribution-to-refugee-camp-near-gorilla-sector/)
indicating that the fuel wood campaign they initiated a month ago surpassed
its $20K goal.

**Twitter**  
The wildlife direct group of blogs also use the popular ‘micro blogging’ tool
twitter to send updates about wildlife protection and conservation efforts in
Africa.

Global Voices Environment used its [twitter
channel](http://twitter.com/globalvoicesenv) last year to micro-blog live from
the [United Nations Climate change
conference](http://www.undispatch.com/livefromtheun.php), and endeavors to use
the twitter tool in future when attending environment related conferences and
events. Please do comment if you know of other environmental tweeters so we
can follow them online.

**Flickr**  
The [environment flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/environment/) pools
photos from over 960 members, creating a visual treasure trove of pictures
ranging from flowers, animals, windmills and more.  
[Foko- Madagascar's flickr stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/13663835@N08/)
includes photos from rural madagascar and the organizations’ efforts in the
area to [](http://www.foko-madagascar.org/?page_id=60)[plant
trees](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ratozamanana/2013776584/in/set-72157602385209951/)
and encourage a sustainable way of life.

**Facebook**  
There are many organizations on facebook that are dedicated to the
environment, clicking on the selected images below will take you a sampling of

**Misc**  
From South Africa, Mike Stopforth who is a speaker, blogger and web
entrepreneur asked on his site if someone could create a badge to show readers
that he cares about the environment. The designer heeded the call and [created
a badge that you can download and use on your
site](http://www.mikestopforth.com/2008/01/11/enviroblog-badge/).
