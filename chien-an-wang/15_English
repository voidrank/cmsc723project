Since the Yanukovych regime fell in February 2014, one of the most popular
explanations for the political violence that gripped the south and east of
Ukraine is [nostalgia for an idealized Soviet
past](http://america.aljazeera.com/features/2014/3/dispatch-from-crimea.html).
Some commentators, such as Julia Ioffe, characterize this nostalgia as
[generational](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116897/eastern-ukraines-
history-under-stalin-holding-it-back). In other words, those too young to
remember the Soviet period properly are less likely to idealize it.

If this is the case, 32-year-old Sevastopol native Boris Rozhin is bucking the
trend. Rozhin, who runs the popular blog [Colonel
Cassad](http://colonelcassad.livejournal.com/), is unrepentant in his
admiration for the Soviet Union, particularly its military achievements in the
Second World War. Rozhin is also unapologetic about his admiration for Joseph
Stalin, whom he credits with winning the war and accomplishing the Soviet
Union's rapid economic growth in the 20th century. His blog carries the half-
ironic subtitle, “The Mouthpiece of Totalitarian Propaganda.” The biggest
influence on his writing, Rozhin claims, are his communist beliefs, which
“incline [him] towards class and dialectical conclusions when analyzing one
event or another.”

Boris Rozhin runs the popular Crimean blog Colonel Cassad.

In addition to Marxist politics and military history, Rozhin's blog also
includes posts on popular culture, video games, and science fiction. These
themes have faded into the background in recent months, though, as Rozhin
“spends most of [his] time providing information on the war in the Donbas,
helping the fighters and refugees there.”

Colonel Cassad has enjoyed a tremendous spike in popularity following the
appearance of the “polite people” in Rozhin's native Crimea. An enthusiastic
supporter of both Crimea's “reunification” with Russia and the various
“people's republics” that have sprouted in eastern Ukraine, Rozhin views the
authorities in Kyiv as an illegitimate “fascist junta” or
“[banderite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera) gang” and blames the
unrest in Ukraine on NATO and the United States. His blog has clearly tapped
into a popular mood among Russian speakers and his posts can receive thousands
of “likes,” shares, and comments.

Rozhin has little time for the mainstream media.

> press.

Rozhin isn't entirely optimistic about the future of blogging, however.

> До недавних пор блогосфере была своего рода исключением, но сейчас и ее
> будут потихоньку подминать в рамках государственного регулирования интернет-
> пространства.

> Until recently the blogosphere was an exception to this rule, but now it's

Rozhin expresses no discomfort about the fact that his support for the
separatists in the Donbas places him in the company of Russian far-right
forces and nationalists, whose views are antithetical to a hard-leftist.
Rozhin draws a historical parallel with “international help” during the
Spanish Civil war, when “the republicans were supported by more than just
communists.” Rather, he sees the conflict as an opportunity.

> Левое движение сейчас в кризисе, и коммунисты должны использовать эту войну,
> для того чтобы учиться организации, координации и другим полезным вещам (в
> том числе и у правых – не идеям, но методу), которые могут пригодится в
> обозримом будущем.

> The leftist movement is now in crisis, and communists must use this war to
> teach themselves organization, coordination, and other useful things
> (borrowing from the right, too, but taking their methods — not their ideas),
> which will be useful in the foreseeable future.

Rozhin has little love for Vladimir Putin, whom he dismisses as a “capitalist
master.” Despite this, his blog has become massively popular among Putin's
supporters. It has also earned him the ire of Ukraine's intelligence services.
Rozhin says Kyiv would arrest him for “calls to overthrow the existing order
of Ukraine, separatism, and ‘terrorism.'” The last charge, in Rozhin's words,
is merely “how the Kyiv junta understands helping the Donbass.”

These are strange and interesting times when a convinced Stalinist with an
interest in military history and science fiction can become a darling of the
RuNet and an enemy of the Ukrainian state. But while Rozhin's politics
currently align him with Russia, he is also at its mercy. Now that he is
living in de facto Russian territory, authorities in Moscow can officially
label “Colonel Cassad” a [mass media
outlet](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/04/12/will-russia-regulate-blogs-
like-mass-media/), restricting Rozhin's ability to write freely. How this
threat will affect his blogging remains to be seen.
