The political and social turmoil caused by the [Euromaidan
protests](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2013-special-
coverage/ukraines-euromaiden-protests/) in Ukraine, Russia's annexation of
Crimea, and the ongoing conflict between the two countries in Eastern Ukraine
have kept the two states in world news headlines. Social media users in both
countries have provided an ongoing stream of opinions, forecasts, and stories,
many of which [RuNet Echo](https://globalvoicesonline.org/-/special/runet-
echo/) has reported on extensively.

The motivation for this project stems from the observed increase in the use of
social media as a tool for political debate and discussion in both Ukraine and
Russia, which became evident during the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine, and
has been a regular feature of the prolonged Russian-Ukrainian conflict. We are
interested in learning more about the kinds of discussions people have, the
kinds of content they post about political issues, and the nature of the
content that “goes viral.” We are also curious about the extent to which the
Twittersphere reflects the daily news agenda and the key political events
during an overall state of political turmoil.

This research builds on the large amount of tweets from opinionated Twitter
users in Ukraine and Russia, and harnesses the power of big-data analysis and
information visualization to shed light on what Internet users think about
their political leaders.

We want to investigate how Russian and Ukrainian Twitter users talk about
their presidents—Vladimir Putin and Petro Poroshenko. Which one do they talk
about more? What do they say and in what context? What images and multimedia
do users associate with these prominent politicians?

To find answers to these and some other questions, we've been collecting
tweets since October 2014, and now have a corpus of over six million tweets
mentioning Putin or Poroshenko in English, Russian, and Ukrainian—data that
can reveal insights about the public discourse around these two men.

We expect these conversations on Twitter to show how users frame the political
situation and their leaders’ decisions in a broad sense, as well as to
demonstrate emotional perceptions of both politicians and their actions.

Twitter, in particular, is a medium through which videos, photographs, and
links to Web content are shared, re-shared, and discussed in a multitude of
ways, so it gives us rich content with which to work. The 140 characters of a
tweet’s text makes up only a small portion (about 2%) of the data for each
tweet. There are also links to embedded media (photos and videos), links to
the Web, the sender's number of followers, “geotag” locations, and so on. This
wealth of metadata, coupled with the tweet’s content, provides a significant
amount of information to explore and visualize.

The data gathering, analysis, and reporting, conducted by [Tetyana
Lokot](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/tetyana-lokot/), RuNet Echo's
contributing editor, [Lawrence
Alexander](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/lawrence-alexander/), a data
scientist and regular RuNet Echo contributor, and [Ed
Summers](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/ed-summers/), Lead Developer at the
Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, will result in a series
of stories, interactive data visualizations, and multimedia content. These
pieces, highlighting different aspects of the dataset and interesting
findings, will be published on RuNet Echo throughout 2015.

We hope you join us as we delve into the collective mind of Russian/Ukrainian
Twitter users to find out how they talk about their presidents, their
politics, and the events of the last year.
