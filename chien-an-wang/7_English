For the last few months, Russia has been the target of Western economic
sanctions over its involvement in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Crimea, a
region Russia annexed from Ukraine in March of last year, has borne the brunt
of the punishment.

The banking industry came under fire first, with Visa and MasterCard removing
support for bank cards in the region. Then, in the middle of January, Apple
[began](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/18/apple-crimea-developers/) to send out
notices to developers whose accounts were registered in Crimea, informing them
their accounts would be blocked.

Apple also ordered retailers to stop all shipments and sales of its products
and services in the region. At the end of the last month, iOS users in Crimea
reported that downloads of both free and paid apps from the App Store was no
longer available.

Android users soon suffered the same fate: Google is now also
[acting](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/google-joins-apple-others-cutting-
off-crimea-blocks-adwords-adsense-google-play/) to block the use its products
and services in Crimea. The company has already ceased Google Play services
and has blocked AdSense and AdWords accounts in the region. Free services like
Gmail, Google Search, and Maps remain available for Crimean citizens. Two more
US companies—Valve, who runs the online video game market
[Steam](http://tjournal.ru/club/1730), and the
[PayPal](http://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/news/38571851/paypal-prekratil-
obsluzhivat-klientov-v-krymu) payment system—have followed suit and blocked
access to their services from Crimea.

The companies are complying with the sanctions under a [US presidential
order](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-
center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo4.pdf) imposed on Crimea in
protest at Russia’s annexation of the peninsula. According to the executive
order, US companies should stop any import or export of “goods, services, or
technology” to or from “the Crimean region of Ukraine” before February 1.

Local users have already found an easy way to counteract the Google and Apple
block by simply changing the location in their profile settings. So far, this
seems to work for the App Store and the Google Play store. Things are much
more complicated for developers, because virtually all of them had been
involved in outsourcing, or working for US or European countries from Crimea.
Local IT entrepreneurs, like Pavel Berman, an ex-producer at IT-firm
“Sloboda,” [told](http://apparat.cc/world/crimea-blocked/) Apparat this was
killing the IT industry in Crimea.

> Пока непонятно, на чём блокировки остановятся. По сути, IT в Крыму если не
> мёртв, то бьётся в конвульсиях

> It is still impossible to tell how far the situation with blockages will go.
> In essence, the Crimea’s IT-industry is in its final death throes, if not
> dead yet.

Crimea, which at one point was a sort of Mecca for freelance developers, who
moved here for better jobs, competitive salaries, and the seaside climate, is
now seeing disillusioned professionals unsure of their future. The developers
are faced with only a few choices if they wish to continue their work: move
away from Crimea, move their work to servers outside of Crimea (e.g., to
Russia, which comes with its own set of problems) or use Tor and other VPN
tools to manage computers in Crimea. None of these are ideal for people who
have been nurturing a local business or a software outsourcing company.

Beyond the circle of IT-professionals, citizens in Crimea don’t seem to overly
care about the tech-related sanctions. The mobile industry in the region is
underdeveloped, so Apple and Google services are not in high acclaim, Berman
said. Developer Dmitry Boychenko also [said](http://apparat.cc/world/crimea-
blocked/) he thought rising prices and other everyday issues were at the
forefront of people's minds.

> I think, that Internet sanctions in particular were insignificant for most

> this [sanctions] means nothing.

Even before the latest crunch of sanctions, Crimea had become a closed region.
With its annexation, the peninsula has lost access to alternative sources of
information, with Ukrainian media taken off the air or blocked online. The
latest sanctions, taking away even more Internet and online service
accessibility, will undoubtedly make the isolation worse.
