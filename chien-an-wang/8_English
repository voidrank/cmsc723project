Zelalem, Edom, and Befeqadu, three jailed Global Voices authors in Ethiopia.

The Global Voices community released today a statement condemning the
imprisonment of bloggers, media workers and online activists around the world.
Names of jailed individuals from countries like China, Bahrain, and Mexico
were read collaboratively in the opening session of the Global Voices Citizen
Media Summit 2015, in Cebu City, Philippines. The statement asserts Global
Voices’ commitment to freedom of expression and their support for their
release from prison.

> We, the members of the Global Voices community, call for an immediate
> release of all online activists, independent media workers, and bloggers
> around the world who are currently imprisoned by governments or held by
> extremists. Like these individuals—many of whom are our friends and
> colleagues—we believe in the right and power of open expression to drive
> change, inspire cooperation and resolve conflict. This power cannot be
> realized, however, without protection of the universal human right to free
> expression.
>
> The following are just some of the people suffering repression at the hands
> of their governments or other powerful actors capable of organized military
> force. There are many more. We cannot remain silent—and you should not
> either. We ask you to join us in demanding that all governments fulfill
> their duty under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: protect and
> respect the rights of these individuals.
