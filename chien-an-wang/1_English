Violations of the Russian blogger law are going unpunished as law enforcement
seems to care little for imposing fines on those who use swearwords, promote
drug use, or offend someone's religious sensibilities while blogging.

Since the infamous ‘blogger law’ came into power in Russia seven months ago,
the telecommunications watchdog Roscomnadzor has documented 67 violations in
53 of the blogs added to the new blogger registry. TJournal
[reports](http://tjournal.ru/paper/rkn-bloggers-violations) that 40 of them
deal with profanity use in the blogs, 17—with “promoting drug use.” Other
violations include calls of extremism, propaganda of Nazi symbols, and content
offensive to sensibilities of religious persons.

Roscomnadzor's head Vadim Ampelonsky explained that the watchdog can only
record the violations, but cannot dole out the punishment, since the law
mandates that various law enforcement agencies are responsible for the
repercussions.

> Само ведомство этого делать не может, так как «санкции» предусмотрены не
> законом о блогерах, а другими нормами права: например, ФСКН может заставить
> отвечать за пропаганду наркотиков, а Генпрокуратура — за экстремизм.

> Our institution cannot do this itself, as the “sanctions” are based not on
> the blogger law per se, but on other legal norms: for instance, Russia's
> Federal Drug Control Service can hold you responsible for drug use
> promotion, and the General Prosecutor's Office can enforce [sanctions] for
> extremism.

An interesting conundrum, according to Roscomnadzor, is that the Russian
police doesn't consider the Internet a “public space,” so it sees no need to
prosecute users for profanity and swearing in blogs. Ampelonsky
[said](https://meduza.io/news/2015/03/05/v-rossii-ostalis-beznakazannymi-vse-
narusheniya-zakona-o-blogerah) they're currently in discussions with
representatives of the police force about whether administrative norms can and
should apply to the online spaces.

The [blogger law](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/25/blogger-law-
russia-activists-ukraine-censorship/) came into force on August 1, 2014 and
tasked Roscomnadzor with adding all Russian bloggers with over 3000 unique
daily views to a special registry. The bloggers, who were essentially equated
with mainstream media, were banned from sharing unverified information,
spreading calls to extremism and swearing. The popular bloggers were also
obligated to disclose their personal information on their websites. Violations
of the law would be punished with administrative fines.

On August 1, when the law gained force, the RuNet staged a [symbolic
protest](http://tjournal.ru/paper/first-day), with many users deliberately
adding profane hashtags, words and images to their tweets in order to
demonstrate the law held no power over them.

On February 12, 2015, a Ukrainian MP proposed a [draft law regulating blogger
activity](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/02/16/ukraine-russia-blogger-
law/) that was essentially a carbon copy of the Russian one. After a public
outcry from journalists, free speech advocates and the Internet in general,
the MP withdrew his proposal, citing peer pressure.
