World leaders pulled an all-nighter in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on
Wednesday in a marathon session of tense, high-stakes international diplomacy.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko welcomed two of the European Union's
most powerful leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Francois Hollande, as well as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian
President Vladimir Putin, all with their diplomatic entourages in tow, for a
dramatic diplomatic push to stop the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine.

Ultimately, the leaders emerged Thursday morning, after a grueling 16 hours of
negotiations, with a [peace
deal](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11407768/Ukraine-
ceasefire-agreement-key-points-what-we-know-so-far.html) to show for their
efforts.

Russians, along with citizens from around the globe, were glued to
developments on social media networks as the talks unfolded. And the fact that
news was sparse for most of the night, with discussions taking place behind
closed doors, barely slowed down the Internet, of course.

The most popular image shared across social networks was probably this
picture:

Numerous social media users utilized the photo for political
[commentary](https://twitter.com/NeinQuarterly/status/565878291547299841) and
jokes.

Many of the most widely shared comments and posts likewise combined humor with
cutting political undertones.

A popular RuNet account specializing in dark humor tied news of the recent
accidental [leak](http://www.businessinsider.com/house-of-cards-
season-3-early-netflix-release-2015-2) of the upcoming season of the popular
Netflix series _House of Cards_ to the tense diplomatic situation in Minsk:

> They're watching the third season of _House of Cards_.

An unflattering photograph of Vladimir Putin arriving in Minsk and a witty
caption garnered Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's account hundred of
retweets.

> Двойника в Минск отправили. На случай, если там подстава

> They sent a body double to Minsk. In case it's a setup.

Another popular item to spread rapidly across social networks was this looped
video, apparently showing Lukashenko pulling Putin's chair away as Putin
attempts to sit down:

Most of those sharing this amusing clip appeared initially unaware, however,
that it was actually news
[footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbMA5cZCtM) run in reverse for
comedic effect.

As the night wore on, many social media posts, especially those by
journalists, began focusing on the theme of sleep deprivation.

> Пресса в Минске перешла в режим стендбай. Ну и я пойду спать.

_TV Rain_ even used a photo of a yawning Poroshenko in a tweet about the
negotiations entering the early morning hours.

Some social media accounts also performed a more serious function. For
example, one Ukrainian aide to President Poroshenko posted
[updates](https://twitter.com/PaulSonne/status/565678743839342592) to his
Facebook account and the German Foreign Office used Twitter to share breaking
news:

> Breaking: Agreement in [#Minsk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Minsk?src=hash).
