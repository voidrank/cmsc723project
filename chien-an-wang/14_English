Russian social media users are raging about Putin's food and drink imports ban
and preparing to cry over empty glasses. Images mixed by author.

Russians might soon find themselves missing Scotch whisky and French cheese.
But especially the whisky. A new decree signed by Vladimir Putin bans the
import of agricultural products from the countries which had earlier imposed
economic sanctions on Russia. The decree, [published on the Kremlin website
today](http://kremlin.ru/news/46404), will last for a year, prohibiting foods
and beverages from European Union countries and the United States in
retaliation for their attempts to pressure Russia on its role in the Ukrainian
conflict.

The exact list of banned goods is still in the works – the only thing we know
for sure is that baby food and wine won't be on it, according to [Dmitry
Medvedev's press secretary Natalya
Timakova](http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/31815381/timakova-spisok-
zapreschennyh-produktov-budet-utverzhden-ne). Other officials have said the
list will definitely include fruit, vegetables, meat products, cheese and
dairy.

Russian internet users went ballistic at the news of the ban, but expressed
the greatest concern about access to Western booze.

User [Ivan Kolpakov](https://twitter.com/kolpakov/) was so concerned [he
forgot to turn off the caps
lock](https://twitter.com/kolpakov/statuses/497035875210231809):

> А ЧТО С БУХЛОМ-ТО БУДЕТ БРАТЦЫ?

> WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THE BOOZE, BROS?

[Ivan Davydov](https://twitter.com/ivan_f_davydov/) was [waving goodbye to his
favorite
drink](https://twitter.com/ivan_f_davydov/statuses/497034682979352576) before
the list was even published:

> Пожалуй, схожу сегодня, попрощаюсь с виски

> 2014](https://twitter.com/ivan_f_davydov/statuses/497034682979352576)

> I guess I'll go and say goodbye to whisky today.

Even the usual jokes were filled with sadness, as [Andrey
Mima](https://twitter.com/amima/)
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/amima/statuses/497036801102843904):

> -Папа, водка подорожала. Ты теперь станешь меньше пить? -Нет, сынок, это ты

> \- Dad, vodka has become more expensive. Are you going to drink less?  
>  – No, son, you're going to eat less.

A few people tried to see the positive side of the ban, like [Nadezhda
Astel](https://twitter.com/astel_/), who [hopes to finally make that diet
work](https://twitter.com/astel_/statuses/497037364108488704):

> AT LEAST I'LL LOSE WEIGHT!

The outpouring of feelings about the food and drink ban was mostly humorous,
as users found increasingly elaborate ways to make fun of Putin's retaliatory
tactics and their consequences. [Denis
Chuzhoy](https://twitter.com/fe_city_boy/)
[wondered](https://twitter.com/fe_city_boy/statuses/497047531478851584) what
the ban would mean for foodies on Instagram:

> Шёл 2015 год. Российские инстаграмы опустели…

> As 2015 rolls by, Russian Instagram accounts are empty…

User [“Wylsacom”](https://twitter.com/wylsacom/)
[suggested](https://twitter.com/wylsacom/statuses/497047357297811457) the lack
of culinary choice might be good reason to take a short trip to a nearby
country:

> \- Ты где был на выходных? \- В Минске, обедал.

> \- Where were you over the weekend?  
>  – In Minsk, went for lunch.

Blogger [Roman Volobuev](https://twitter.com/romanvolobuev/) [had the business
solution](https://twitter.com/romanvolobuev/statuses/497051906548981760) well
in hand:

> А еще я медиа-стартап придумал: я тут в Риге буду покупать разную еду, есть

> Oh, and I came up with a media startup: I will buy all kinds of food here in
> Riga, eat it, and tell you what it tastes like.

For many users, the news immediately brought to mind memories of Soviet
deficits and long lines in empty shops, which many of the 30-somethings in
Russia experienced as children. [Maxim
magazine](https://twitter.com/ru_maximonline/)
[reimagined](https://twitter.com/ru_maximonline/statuses/497057498726019072)
what that could look like today:

> Этой осенью в российских магазинах.

On a more somber note, journalist [Roman
Dobrokhotov](https://twitter.com/Dobrokhotov/) posted a black and white image
of the old food shortages (and [did so before the final ban news were
announced](https://twitter.com/Dobrokhotov/statuses/496678882125561860)):

> Вообще-то Кремль уже когда-то назло Западу запрещал все иностранные продукты

> Actually, the Kremlin has already banned foreign goods to spite the West,
> and this is what it looked like.

Dobrokhotov also [started a flash-mob on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/r.dobrokhotov/posts/10152223542071491),
asking his readers to share memories of Soviet “good old” times, attracting
many less than fond recollections of hardship.

Russian officials promise that the foreign goods ban will not impact local
food prices and say the list will allow further changes. But the real question
is: should Russians really be saying their farewells to their favorite booze?
And should they be stocking up on Snickers and Kinder Surprises?

Those running the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/morketolog/) of
popular Russian startup news website [“Цукерберг
Позвонит”](http://siliconrus.com/) [summed it up
well](https://twitter.com/morketolog/statuses/497079372764172288): it seems
pop culture wisdom totally flew over the heads of Russian officials:

> Эй, вы не так поняли цитату Джобса "Stay hungry. Stay fooloish."

> Hey, you completely misunderstood the Jobs quote “Stay hungry. Stay
> foolish.”
