A shelling attack in Eastern Ukraine hit a civilian bus driving near a
Ukrainian army checkpoint and resulted in over a dozen casualties. Online,
pro-Russian rebels boasted of hitting an enemy target in the area, but then
claimed it was the Ukrainians who did the shelling.

At 4:09pm Kyiv time today, the “[Novorossiya First
operative](https://vk.com/covnovorossia)” VKontakte page posted a message
reporting that a “Ukrainian checkpoint at the exit from Volnovakha to Donetsk
has been destroyed,” with information received at 3:53pm Kyiv time (4:53pm
Moscow time). Soon after, tragic news emerged: at approximately 2:30pm, a
shell had [struck a passenger
bus](http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/01/13/7054893/) near the Ukrainian
military checkpoint at Volnovakha, Donetsk region, killing at least 10 people
and wounding at least 13 others.

As soon as the news emerged, the finger pointing began. Ukrainian authorities
immediately [blamed](http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/01/13/7054893/)
separatist forces for shelling the bus while attacking the Ukrainian army-held
checkpoint with a Grad multiple rocket launcher. The “[Donbass
News](https://twitter.com/novostidnua/)” independent news website also accused
pro-Russian fighters of attacking the Kyiv-2 battalion checkpoint and killing
civilians.

In response, Donetsk People’s Republic authorities departed from the initial
messages on affiliated social media accounts and said that they [had not
opened fire](http://ren.tv/novosti/2015-01-13/pod-doneckom-vzorvan-reysovyy-
avtobus-pogibli-10-chelovek). A DPR representative later
[told](http://www.novoross.info/donetsk/29987-po-donecku-strelyaet-
nepodkontrolnyy-poroshenko-ukrainskiy-specbatalon-sich-pushilin.html) pro-
rebel media that an “out of control” Ukrainian battalion has been shelling
Donetsk and was “provoking [rebel] militia to respond.” In other words,
Donetsk authorities accused Ukraine of carrying out a false flag attack on its
own location in order to then blame separatist forces.

This is not the first time we have seen a declaration, or perhaps even
boasting, of an attack by separatists online, quickly followed by an assertion
that the attack was actually carried out by the Ukrainian military. Thirty
minutes after the tragic [downing of flight
MH17](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/07/17/russia-ukraine-plane-war-
tragedy/) last summer, the “[Strelkov Info](https://vk.com/strelkov_info)” VK
account—ran by pro-Russian separatists, but not Igor “Strelkov” Girkin
himself—posted a message bragging about shooting down a Ukrainian AN-26
transport plane. The post warned Ukrainians to “not fly in our skies.”

Soon after, the separatists denied their role in shooting down the MH17,
instead pointing to Ukraine, claiming that Kyiv used an air-to-air missile,
SU-25 machine guns, a combination of both, or even their own Buk anti-aircraft
missile system to shoot down MH17. When the bus attack news spread, many RuNet
users found immediate parallels between the boasting-turned-retraction in the
two events:

In the same way media and citizen journalists worked to uncover clues in the
MH17 tragedy, the evidence from this shelling—the trajectory of the artillery,
the type of shell used, any intercepted communications—will reveal the
culprits of the attack that led to the loss of civilian lives. But once again,
the initial online messages, social media posts, and subsequent reaction of
the Donetsk separatists on social networks may be a giveaway of how and why
the incident occurred.
