After the recent [tragic
floods](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/04/photos-more-flooding-in-
serbia-damages-cities/) in the region, residents of several former Yugoslavian
countries seem to have taken to old habits to help fix the vast damage done by
the natural disaster. In Kraljevo, Serbia, as
[reported](http://radiosarajevo.ba/novost/161001/slovenci-makedonci-i-srbi-
zajedno-na-omladinskoj-radnoj-akciji) by Bosnian Radio Sarajevo and Serbian
national news agency Tanjug, over 50 volunteers from Macedonia, Slovenia, and
several Serbian cities have gathered in Kraljevo for a “[youth work
action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_work_actions)” to rebuild roads and
other basic infrastructure.

After World War II, a country formed out of six southeastern European states
and dubbed the [Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia)
became known to the world, as an anonymous author once put it, as “the only
place where the iron curtain sways”. Yugoslavia was a firmly socialist country
— it was the only communist country in Eastern Europe never to have been a
satellite of the former USSR. Hence, while in good relations with both East
and West most of the time, it was often left to fend for itself. What most
people today don't know is that the young Yugoslavia, made up of states that
were terribly damaged during the World War, rebuilt its country mostly on its
own.

Youth work actions were popular voluntary labor activities in the former
Yugoslavia, organized by the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia. Some of the
more massive labor actions built roads, railroads, new neighborhoods and the
[Highway of Brotherhood and
Unity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_%22Brotherhood_and_Unity%22),
which stretched 1,180 kilometers across the country, from Slovenia in the
northwest to Macedonia in the southeast. These work actions perished with the
fall of Yugoslavia.

The youth work action today in Kraljevo is a self-organized, civic activity,
led by a handful of people who participated in the youth work actions of the
former Yugoslavia. They are focused on 10 locations in and around the city
that have been left “uncategorized” by government agencies assessing the flood
damage, meaning that authorities deem that the damage done to uncategorized
infrastructure and homes are not damaged enough to qualify for government aid
in one of the six categories established so far.

The 50 volunteers are mostly between 18 and 30 years of age. Zoran Stevovski
from Ohrid, Macedonia, is among the oldest volunteers and recalled for Radio
Sarajevo his experience taking part in the youth work actions organized in the
former Yugoslavia:

> “Predsjednik sam udruženja koje okuplja bivše akcijaše, ali i one mlađe,
> koji žele da učestvovati u ovoj našoj priči. Bio sam 12 puta na radnim
> akcijama, a počeo sam upravo u ovim krajevima, na Moravi, 1979. godine i to
> je trajalo do 1990. godine u Beogradu. Radili smo na nasipima Zapadne Morave
> i Rasine. Vratio sam se tamo gdje sam i počeo”, kaže Stevovski.

> “I am president of the association that gathers former [work] action
> volunteers, but also those who are younger, who want to participate in our
> story. I participated 12 times in work actions and I began in this exact
> area, on the Morava [river], in 1979, and that lasted until 1990 in
> Belgrade. We worked on the river dikes on Western Morava and Rasina. I came
> back where I started,” says Stevovski.

This YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drMxVqUrjQU) shows the
youth work actions, that included volunteers of all ages, that built the
Highway of Brotherhood and Unity, connecting all six states of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The video includes footage of then Yugoslav
leader Josip Broz Tito congratulating the volunteer workers on fulfilling
their promise of getting the highway built in under a year and on schedule
(English subtitles included).

The work action days in Kraljevo begin at 5:30 in the morning and end at 10 in
the evening, with visits to cultural institutions, meals, an some
entertainment during the work day.
