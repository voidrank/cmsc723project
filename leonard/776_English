Thimphu, the small capital of Bhutan is in a [flurry of activity,
](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=15197)gearing
up for the upcoming [SAARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAARC) (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Summit which will take place at the end
of April (28-29). This is the first time that Bhutan is hosting the Summit
having [passed the
opportunity](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=12514)
three times in the past because of a lack of infrastructure.

However, the country is extremely proud that it will be hosting it this year,
a year which coincides with the Silver Jubilee of the Regional Association.
The SAARC, the most important regional alliance, was established when its
Charter was adopted on December 8, 1985 and now have Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as member nations. [Bhutanese
newspapers](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=15197)
report that 450 delegates from these countries and about 150 journalists are
expected to attend and cover the summit and international observers from
China, Japan, the European Union, Republic of Korea, USA, Australia, Mauritius
and Iran will also attend.

[quoted](http://maldiveslive.blogspot.com/2010/04/deals-on-environment-trade-
to-be-signed.html) Bangladesh Foreign Secretary _Mijarul Quayes_ as saying
that Bangladesh and the Maldives are two countries most vulnerable to changing
climate.

Besides, the summit is expected to sign agreement on trade and services, rapid
response to natural disaster and cooperation in environment and South Asian
Development Fund.

It is also being speculated that Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and his
Pakistani counterpart, Yousuf Raza Gilani, may take this opportunity to meet
on the side to talk in detail about counter-terrorism in the two countries,
even though the [Hindustan Times](http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-meeting-
between-Gilani-Singh-on-sidelines-of-SAARC-Pak/H1-Article1-531634.aspx) has
informed that the two leaders will not be meeting.

_Ejaz Ghani_ , Economic Advisor in South Asia region at the World Bank,
[emphasizes](http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-can-be-
done-about-conflict-south-asia) in a blog-post that the key to political
stability and poverty alleviation in South Asia is to deal with the terrorism
and internal conflicts:

> South Asian governments have taken a variety of different approaches to
> counter terrorism. Reviewing these approaches in the South Asian and global
> context, it appears that the armed forces or local militias have not been
> especially effective in combating terrorism. [..]
>
> Regional cross-border cooperation is an essential part of any
> counterinsurgency strategy. Considerable potential exists for regional
> cooperation in reducing conflict, but this has been an underutilized

Regarding the Bhutanese Refugee issue Bhutanese dissident Adhikari says on his
[blog](http://freedombhutan.blogspot.com/2010/04/is-bhutan-ready-to-resolve-
refugee.html):

> Nepal has better opportunity to raise the issue during the SAARC summit
> scheduled for April last in Thimphu.

While all countries want to take this opportunity to iron out their regional
differences there is optimism that regional politics will not overshadow
common concerns like poverty alleviation, promoting economic cooperation and
climate change.
