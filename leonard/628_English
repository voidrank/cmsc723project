Hospital Ayres de Menezes Pediatrics Ward, Blog Joãozinho Leve Leve

In the past few months, a heated discussion animated the blogosphere of Sao
Tome and Principe, on a public health problem that apparently has already been
solved. Until last week, there was no water running from the taps of Ayres de
Menezes Hospital, but its director now
[assures](http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/08/13/5011/comparticipacao-
de-custos-e-autonomia-financeira-para-o-hospital-ayres-de-menezes/) that the
issue has been taken care of.

From the beginning of 2010, bloggers have discussed the serious lack of water
in the main hospital of Sao Tome, though [the supply problems date back more
than five
years](http://www.noticiaslusofonas.com/view.php?load=arcview&article=27060&catogory=S%20Tom%E9%20e%20Pr%EDncipe).

In February, Ricardo Bianchi, a Portuguese doctor working in a mission at the
hospital, wrote in blog _[Joãozinho Leve-
leve](http://joaozinholeveleve.blogspot.com/)_ about the state of the health
sector in Sao Tome, and particularly about the daily life of medical
practitioners.

From his point of view, the lack of water represents one of the main
hindrances to medical practice, which leads him to fear that _[in some
situations, he would not be able to avoid a tragic ending, due to scarce
resources](http://joaozinholeveleve.blogspot.com/2010/02/mais-acostumado-ao-
modus-operandi-do.html)_ , as he explains:

> Os distintivos a assinalarem estes projectos de cooperação estão por toda a
> parte, mas a utilização de forma sustentada dos recursos tecnológicos
> existentes torna-se muito difícil quando as falhas de energia são constantes
> e o hospital não dispõe, actualmente, de água corrente. Resultado:
> enfermarias sobre-lotadas, quentes e mal ventiladas associadas a múltiplas
> restrições na realização de exames auxiliares de diagnóstico. Uma realidade
> muito diferente daquela a que nos habituámos nas Faculdades de Medicina e
> nos hospitais do nosso país [Portugal]!

One can see signs highlighting aid projects everywhere, but the sustained use
of existing technological resources becomes very difficult when power outages
are constant and the hospital currently does not have tap water. Result: over-
crowded, hot and poorly-ventilated wards that become associated with multiple
constraints in conducting diagnosis examinations. A very different reality
than the one familiar to us in medical schools and hospitals of our country
[Portugal]!

Three months later, Américo, another doctor from Portuguese Aid starting a
mission, [reported](http://joaozinholeveleve.blogspot.com/2010/05/finalmente-
sao-tome.html) his first impressions in the same blog:

> As limitações de espaço e a desadequação das estruturas são evidentes, e não
> são estranhas aos profissionais que nela trabalham e que tentam diariamente
> fazer o melhor com aquilo que existe. Uma das maiores dificuldades é sem
> dúvida a falta de água corrente no hospital o que dificulta a higiene dos
> doentes e dos profissionais e impõe ainda maiores limites ao tipo de exames
> disponíveis.

The space constraints and the inadequacy of the structures are both evident
and not strange to the professionals who work there every day while trying to
do the best only using the available resources. A main difficulty is
undoubtedly the lack of running water in the hospital which complicates the
hygiene of patients and professionals and imposes even greater limits on the
type of tests available.

The discussion was taken to a different level back in May, when Humbah Aguiar,
a Saotomean citizen in the diaspora, spread an appeal through a video he made
available on Youtube, titled _[In STP The rich steal water from the Hospital
and the people just watch!!!!!??](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UseGCxztRlY)_
:

> No Principal hospital de S.tomé não há água porque a população rica do país
> extraviou para suas casas.  
>  São-tomenses façam alguma coisa, manifestem saiam a rua….  
>  Esta minha revolta é apenas um desabafo….

The main hospital in São Tomé doesn't have water because the rich population
from our country divert it to their houses.  
Santomeans do something, demonstrate out in the streets…  
This revolt of mine is just me letting it out …

In the video, Aguiar shows his revolt after having read a [news story
](http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/05/24/4060/ariete-leite-crianca-
internada-com-secura-no-hospital-ayres-de-menezes/)about a child for whom it
was not possible to find water at Ayres de Menezes even for drug intake. The
article stressed a [previous
denunciation](http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/04/29/3001/bairro-de-
elite-campo-de-milho-provoca-crise-de-agua-do-hospital-central/) concerning
water diverted from the hospital to an elite housing area nearby – the Campo
de Milho:

> Sede e insanidade geral no hospital central, enquanto que há cerca de 200
> metros do centro de saúde, água abundante mata sede de figuras políticas e
> do mundo empresarial que habitam no campo de milho. « **Têm água para beber
> e para regar os seus jardins** », desabafou um dos utentes do banco de
> urgência.
>
> A água que irriga as residências de luxo do campo de milho, foi canalizada
> exclusivamente para o hospital central. Os poderosos que vivem no bairro de
> elite vizinho ao hospital, vandalizaram a canalização e levaram a água para
> as suas casas, para o seu bem-estar, para o seu deleite.

Thirst and general insanity in the central hospital, while about 200 meters
from the health center, plenty of water quenches the thirst of political
figures and business men living in the Campo de Milho. “They have water for
drinking and watering their gardens,” blurted one of the patients at the
emergency ward.

The water that irrigates the luxury homes of the Campo de Milho was
exclusively piped to the central hospital. The powerful people living in the
elite neighborhood nearby the hospital, vandalized the pipe and took the water
to their homes, to their well-being, to their delight.

The video triggered a discussion that quickly spread to other online social
forums, such as _[São Tomé Blog](http://saotomeblog.com/)_ group on
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/SaoTomeBlog?ref=ts) and _[Canal
Santola](http://canalsantola.info/)_. Fifteen days later the video had had
over 1500 views and the reactions of netcitizens began to multiply through the
different platforms. At that time, the news website [Téla Nón published an
article ](http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/06/11/4384/milagre-no-
hospital-ayres-de-menezes/)in which the Director of the Hospital asserted that
the problem was solved in 80-90% of the facilities. Reportedly, the hospital
was making use of the pipes from an abandoned building nearby. A few days
later the [same news was shown to be
false](http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/06/20/4548/afinal-nao-aconteceu-
milagre-no-hospital-ayres-de-menezes/):

> O Hospital Central Ayres de Menezes, continua sem acesso a água canalizada.
> Como tem acontecido nos últimos meses, é a corporação dos bombeiros que tem
> levado alguns metros cúbicos de água para o centro de saúde de referência do
> país.

The Central Hospital Ayres de Menezes, is still without access to piped water.
Continuing what has been happening in recent months, the firefighters
corporation is the the responsible for bringing some cubic meters of water to
the countries reference health center.

Such statements just sparked the ongoing online discussion with a new focus:
the quality of the water provided by firefighters. The Minister of Health of
Sao Tome and Principe, Arlindo Carvalho, had earlier [presented his concerns
](http://www.noticiaslusofonas.com/view.php?load=arcview&article=26372&catogory=S%20Tom%E9%20e%20Pr%EDncipe)about
the potential emergence of a spate of contaminations in the hospital, taking
into account the difficulties that the patients were having fulfilling basic
needs, such as their own personal hygiene. Dozens of comments later, on last
August 13th, the Director of Hospital Ayres de Menezes, José Luis, [stated
](http://www.telanon.info/sociedade/2010/08/13/5011/comparticipacao-de-custos-
e-autonomia-financeira-para-o-hospital-ayres-de-menezes/)that “the water is
running in the taps of the Hospital”
[sparingly](http://www.africanidade.com/articles/4150/1/SAo-TomA-e-PrAncipe-
PM-visita-hospital-menos-de-duas-horas-depois-de-receber-testemunhos-do-seu-
antecessor/Paacutegina1.html), though the process for resolving the problem
was not clarified, neither the consequences for those responsible for the
water diversion to Campo de Milho.
