[A
referendum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Sudanese_independence_referendum,_2011)
is currently taking place in Southern Sudan from 9 January until 15 January
2011 to decide whether or not the south should remain a part Sudan or be an
independent state. These are photos documenting Southern Sudan's landmark
referendum.

New flag of Southern Sudan. The meaning of the colors: Black – the Southern
Sudanese people, Red – the blood shed for freedom, Green – the land, Blue –
the waters of the river Nile Gold Star – unity of the states of Southern
Sudan.
