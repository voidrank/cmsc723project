Protests continue in Tunisia, following the declarations of [former Interior
Minister Farhat Rajhi](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/29/tunisia-
bloggers-angry-at-interim-interior-minister-sacking/) published on a Facebook
page called
“[Skandali”](http://www.facebook.com/pages/%D8%B3%D9%83%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A/189311741091187)in
which he predicts that there would be a military coup, by loyalists of the
ousted President, if the Islamist Party Al-Nahdha wins the elections on July
24. He also claimed that [Rachid
Ammar,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachid_Ammar) Chief of Staff of the
Tunisian Armed Forces, went to Qatar to meet with the former President Ben
Ali, and that Tunisia continues to be run by a shadow government, headed by a
friend of Ben Ali, Kamel Ltaief.

Pro democracy protestors gathered twice during the last 24 hours, on Thursday
afternoon and on Friday morning, in Hbib Bourguiba Avenue, to call for the
overthrow of the government. On the two occasions protestors were brutally
dispersed by riot police using tear gas and batons.
