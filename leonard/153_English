From watching Russian television this week, you might think that the annual
May 9 commemorations of the defeat of Nazi Germany in
[Lvov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv), Ukraine, were under siege from
throngs of neo-Nazi, Ukrainian nationalists.

Television footage showed hooded young Ukrainians attacking World War II
veterans, giving Nazi salutes, and chanting nationalist slogans. As they
ripped [St. George
ribbons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_of_Saint_George) from people's
shirts, it seemed that Ukrainian youth had forgotten the terrible sacrifices
made by the Soviet Union to defeat Germany.

There are few historical events that evoke more passion across the vast space
of the former Soviet Union than World War II. And for good reason. Even
conservative estimates of the cost of the war are unimaginable: more than 20
million dead.

In Russia, May 9 – known simply as [Victory
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_\(May_9\)) – is a day for
Russians to honor the terrible sacrifices made to defeat Hitler's Germany in
what is widely known as [the Great Patriotic
War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War_\(term\)). Indeed, for
many Russians, these sacrifices represent nothing less than the simple and
glorious triumph of good over evil.

For people in regions caught between the Soviet Union and Germany, however,
the legacy of May 9 is not so simple. In Ukraine, for instance, it is the day
to remember the terrible sacrifices made during the war – as well as the day
that ended Ukraine's hopes of independence from the Soviet Union. Indeed,
[Ukrainian
nationalists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army) had hoped
to take advantage of the war to fashion an independent Ukraine.

Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, both the Russian government and
some ethnic Russians still living in the newly independent republics have
sought to defend the Soviet Union's historical legacy in the face of what they
see as unfair historical accounts of Soviet imperialism.

Nationalists, on the other hand, have sought to cement their position as
independent nations in the face of what they see as Russia's neo-Soviet
imperial ambition.

This simmering tension reached the surface in
[Tallinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn), Estonia, in 2007, when
[Russians openly clashed with
authorities](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2007/04/27/estonia-a-russian-
rebellion/) after the Estonian government announced that they would be moving
a World War II monument known as [the Bronze
Soldier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn). Soon after,
[an unprecedented Russian cyber
attack](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia) shut
down the Estonian government.

The May 9 clashes in Lvov seemingly presented another example of this
simmering tension. With images of Ukrainian nationalist groups attacking aging
World War II veterans, the Russian media had the perfect opportunity to paint
Ukrainians as proto-fascists, intent on desecrating the sacred memory of
Russian sacrifices in the Great Patriotic War. For instance, [_Russia Today_
‘s story on the clashes](http://rt.com/news/wwii-veterans-ukraine-police/)
reported that:

> Not everyone regards Victory Day as a cause for celebration. In Western
> Ukraine, nationalist party members have violently disrupted a memorial
> service as veterans paid tribute to those who perished in the war . . .
> Unlike most of the post-Soviet region on May 9th, the western Ukrainian city
> of Lvov became a vicious display of neo-Nazism. Several thousand activists
> from radical nationalist parties blocked the entrance to Red Army soldiers’
> cemeteries, preventing war veterans from getting inside and paying tribute.

The clashes also fostered a wide-ranging debate on [_Oleg Kozyrev_ ‘s
blog](http://oleg-kozyrev.livejournal.com/3513476.html) [ru], after he posted
a clip from Russian television detailing the events. In hundreds of comments,
bloggers debated the meaning of the clashes. Were the clashes signs of a
growing fascist, neo-Nazi movement in Ukraine? Or were they result of a small
minority of idiotic Ukrainian ultranationalists?

One of the most interesting parts of the debate centered around an [blog
post](http://ru-indeec.livejournal.com/3281.html) [ru] from Egor Kustov
(LiveJournal user _ru-indeec_ ), a Lvov-based Russophone freelance copywriter.
His eyewitness account gave a more complete version than the one on Russian
television:

> Меня не интересует политика, но всё же не могу не написать о том, очевидцем
> чего я стал сегодня от львовского Холма Славы. Жаль, не взял фотоаппарат.
> Итак, прогуливаясь по Лычаковской, я увидел большую группу людей с красными
> и российскими флагами, транспорантами, плакатами. Я, конечно, читал, что
> акция пророссийской партии “Русское единство” то ли состоится во Львове, то
> ли не состоится… запутано там всё у них было. Ну вот, думаю, всё же
> приехали. […] Они, как по команде, вдруг стали выкрикивать лозунги,
> оскорбляющие местных жителей. Причём, заметьте, лозунги не политические, а
> оскорбляющие людей по национальному признаку. Больше всего запомнилось
> “Хохлы – параша! Победа эта наша!”, “Смерть Галичине!”… были и прочие.
> Конечно же, спустя пару минут завязалась потасовка. Поскольку численный
> перевес был, естественно, не на стороне провокаторов, им пришлось убегать. И
> тут с их стороны раздались выстрелы. […]

I am not interested in politics, but I feel compelled to write about what I
witnessed. I am sorry I did not bring a camera. As I was walking down
Lychakovskaya, I saw a large group of people with banners and signs, as well
as red and Russian flags. I had of course read that the pro-Russian group
“Russian Unity” would either hold a rally in Lvov or not… [reports] were
rather confusing. Well, I thought, they did come here after all. […] They, as
a group, suddenly began to shout slogans, insulting the local residents. The
slogans were not political, but instead were national slurs. The ones I
remember best included “[Ukrainians aren't worth a bucket of spit!] It is our
victory!” and “Death to
[[Galicia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_\(Eastern_Europe\))]!”… Of
course, in less than a minute, scuffles broke out. Since naturally these
[Russian] provocateurs did not have a numerical advantage, they started to
run. And then the shooting started. […]

Mr. Kustov's account of the Russian provocateurs complicated the clean
narrative of Russian victimhood. In [a subsequent post](http://ru-
indeec.livejournal.com/3496.html) [ru], Mr. Kustov denied allegations that he
had written this eyewitness account for money and stated that he was simply
trying to defend Lvov's image. He wrote:

> […] Такую акцию, в которой участвуют провокаторы с обеих сторон, не сложно
> устроить в любом городе. В Москве тоже бывают массовые беспорядки с участием
> больших групп скинхедов (в масках, со знамёнами и т.д.), но ведь СМИ после
> этого не навязывают мнение, что всё население города – фашисты? […]

[…] These kinds of clashes, in which both sides provoke violence, are easy to
fabricate in any city. In Moscow clashes are often incited by large groups of
skinheads (wearing masks, with banners, etc.), but the media do not come to
the immediate conclusion that the entire city is comprised of fascists? […]

For Mr. Kustov, these clashes were simply a media-created tempest in a teapot,
the product of extremists on both sides. And there is no sign that the furor
around these clashes is settling down. Two days after the clashes, the Russian
Duma issued a statement [calling on the Ukrainian
authorities](http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/05/11/50158566.html) to punish the
Ukrainian nationalists behind the clashes. Mr. Kustov ended with a saying:

> Во времена холодной войны между СССР и США кто-то из политиков (не помню кто
> именно) сказал: “Фермеру из Оклахомы и крестьянину с Поволжья ведь нечего
> делить. Поэтому им война не нужна. Она нужна политикам”.

During the cold war between the USSR and the USA some politician (I do not
remember who) said: “A farmer from Oklahoma and a peasant from
[[Povolzhye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Region)] have [nothing to
fight each other for]. That's why they have no use for war. Only politicians
need it.”

And that is perhaps the biggest untold story of these clashes: Mr. Kustov and
the silent majority of Russians and Ukrainians in Lvov have little practical
use for this big political game.
