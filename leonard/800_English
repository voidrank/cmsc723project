A Chinese coal ship is spilling its oil onto Australia’s icon Great Barrier
Reef:

“It sounds like the plot of a disaster movie!” according to Geoff Sidebottom
of _Views from Towradgi (Comments from the Australian city of Wollongong on
local and world events)_. His sentiments have been shared around the country:

> … beaches on the Queensland coast and nearby Great Keppel island will be
> damaged – and our vital tourist industry will be threatened.
>
> This ship was fifteen miles off course outside the shipping lane. Either
> incompetence or a lack of local knowledge could have been prevented had an
> experienced pilot been at the helm.
>
> Surely a requirement that must be immediately implemented for all Barrier
> reef shipping !

Brian, at group blog _Larvatus Prodeo_ , reminded us that:

> A little over a year ago there was a major oil spill off the coast of SE

> aground](http://larvatusprodeo.net/2009/03/13/dreck-in-paradise-hamish-
> leaves-his-mark/) spewing 270 tonnes of oil across the Sunshine Coast and
> Moreton Island. Now a Chinese ship, the Shen Neng 1, plowed at full stem
> into a reef about 120km east of Rockhampton on the southern edge of the

Australian Senate candidate Larissa Waters is very clear about what _The
Greens_ want:

> Marine pilots should be compulsory for carriers navigating the entire inner
> Great Barrier Reef, and industry should bear the full cost of pollution
> clean ups, said the Greens today as an unknown amount of oil leaks from a
> coal carrier off Great Keppel Island.
>
> The Great Barrier Reef is not a coal highway, it is a multibillion dollar
> tourism icon and biodiversity wonder which government should do its utmost
> to protect.
>
> Instead Government is bending over backwards to increase exports of fossil
> fuels, rather than investing in job rich clean renewable energy which
> safeguards our Reef.

The ruckus was picked up across the Pacific. In the U.S. the liberal
_Irregular Times (News Unfit to Print)_ drew obvious parallels with local
developments:

We can only be thankful that this time it was a coal ship not an oil tanker.
