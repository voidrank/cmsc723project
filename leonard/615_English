Drug abuse detention centers in Asia are in the spotlight. Although some Asian
drug addicts go in voluntarily to kick their habit, in some places, this has
led to routine human rights abuses where people off the street are locked up
with no choice, tortured, raped, forced to work for free and denied basic
comforts.

The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union has released [_Abuse in the Name of
Treatment_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7sz0vzk09E), a new video showing
the situation of people sent into some compulsory drug detention centers in
Asia. Some are sent there by family or walk themselves in to kick their drug
habit, but in some other places, military police routinely round up anyone
they consider “deviant”. So street children, sex workers and drug users are
sent to these camps with no right to appeal. Adding insult to injury, some of
these camps were built with money sent by Western governments, so the HCLU is
[calling viewers to action](http://drogriporter.hu/en/ddt):

> One of the centers – Koh Kor – was closed thanks to human rights advocacy
> but there are still too many in operation. HCLU, along with international
> organizations such as UNAIDS or UNODC, is calling for the closure of these
> camps. We hope after watching our new movie more people will join us and put
> pressure on these governments to stop the abuse in the name of drug
> treatment.

[Current TV's Vanguard ](http://current.com/shows/vanguard/)released web
episodes discussing the subject of[ drug
addictions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6296c7uoTU), [Meth production and
consumption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fEtqryl80) in Cambodia and
[visited Korsang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HBBnzusW7o), a harm
reduction center created as an alternative to the abuses happening in
government run drug detainment centers.

Also in Cambodia, students at the University of Puthisastra made a two part
video for the UPSTV showing [their
perspective](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNVw-1nf5G4) on why youth get
involved with drugs in the first place:

At the end of the [Second part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ7_7hn80iI),
Kosal returns from his 5 year prison sentences a changed man, willing to right
his wrongs and have a fresh start. Their perspective of how a drug addict is
sent to a place where he or she can genuinely get better should become a
reality, because it shouldn't[ take a
miracle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmJQCwwfvt8).
