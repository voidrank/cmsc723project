The protest movement in Iran continues to defy the Islamic Regime in different
ways, from shouting _‘Allaho Akbar’_ (God is Great) from rooftops at night (a
common cheer at protests) to demonstrating on[ Quds (Jerusalem)
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quds_Day).

The Quds Day, referring to the Arabic word for Jerusalem — takes place on
September 18 this year. The Islamic Republic's authorities use this day to
denounce Israel and show support for the Palestinians

But this year, the Iranian protest movement (Green Movement) who still dispute
the election results that declared incumbent president [Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad) the winner in
June, have decided to mark the occasion by defying the Iranian authorities and
marching in the streets of Tehran and other cities once more.

Here is a video that showing a photo of [Mir Hussein
Mousavi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi), the reformist
leader and main opposition candidate, attached to a bridge on Nyayesh Highway
in Tehran, bearing this slogan: “Quds Day, Green Day”.

Several designs and photos announcing this event have appeared in Iranian
online citizen media. Slogans and designs display the protest mood in country.
