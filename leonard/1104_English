A new online campaign asks lawmakers to “ _[Restore
Fairness](http://www.restorefairness.org)_ ” to deportation proceedings of
immigrants in the United States suspected of being undocumented or in
violation of the terms of their visas. [Thousands of
people](http://restorefairness.org/about/resources/) are currently
incarcerated in detention centers and jails and denied court hearings across
the country.

The campaign created by the human rights organization
[_Breakthrough_](http://www.breakthrough.tv/), documents the lives of numerous
individuals who have encountered grave injustices in detention centers or in
dealing with immigration authorities through a series of videos.

From the [About page](http://restorefairness.org/about/) on _Restore Fairness_
:

> “The Restore Fairness campaign is calling on the U.S. government to restore
> due process and fairness to our immigration system. Since the Declaration of
> Independence, America has striven to uphold fairness and due process. But
> today, a broken immigration system denies basic human rights and due process
> to people who live here. In the aftermath of 9-11, immigrants have borne the
> brunt of harsh policies, with the U.S. government allowing raids and arrests
> without warrants, holding thousands in inhumane detention conditions, and
> deporting people without a fair trial.”

The _Restore Fairness_ campaign encourages Americans to ask their local
representatives to help win every individual a “fair day in court”; create
legally enforceable detention standards and implement cost effective
alternatives to detention; and stop indiscriminate raids and the continued use
of local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law.

They are also asking immigrants who feel their human rights have been violated
to share their stories.

At the heart of the campaign is [a 9-minute
documentary](http://vimeo.com/6200660) created with the assistance of 26
partner organizations. There is also a
[blog](http://restorefairness.org/blog/), a [Twitter
feed](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23restorefairness),
[resources](http://restorefairness.org/about/resources/) for further study of
the issue, and [videos](http://restorefairness.org/videos/) of several more
people who have been wronged.

One story shared was that of Juana Villegas. She was arrested while pregnant
and was forced to have her baby while a sheriff stood in her hospital room:

> She was taken in for a routine traffic violation that is normally taken care
> of by a simple citation. This violation (of which she was later cleared) was
> handled by immigration authorized local police and she was locked up in a
> jail in her state. Taken to the hospital in chains, she went through labor
> with a sheriff’s officer standing guard in her hospital room, where one of
> her feet was cuffed to the bed most of the time.

June Everett shared a story too. Not her own story, but that of her sister’s
who died while in detainment.

> Sandra Kenley, a 52-year-old grandmother, who after living in the U.S.
> legally for 33 years, was subjected to degrading and grossly inhumane
> conditions, which led to her untimely death.

Ali also suffered in immigration detention. Born in Pakistan, Ali arrived in
New York City to live freely as a gay man. When he was detained though for
year, he wasn’t given the medicine he needed as an HIV positive resident.

> He says, “There’s no benefit for HIV+ or AIDS people. If you die in your
> room they don’t care.”

The stories of Villegas, Kenley and Ali are sadly not unique. Breakthrough
have highlighted the stories of many more people living in the United States.
In hopes that the immigration system could be reformed, they encourage viewers
to take action:

> With your help, we can mobilize members of organizations, groups and
> individuals to demand that our government uphold the human rights of all
> people within the immigration system. We need you to take action now.
> Together, we can stand up for American values of due process and fairness.
