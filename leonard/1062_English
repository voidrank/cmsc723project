[October](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October) has become the month of the
worldwide celebration of [Creole
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language) and the Creole
blogosphere is paying attention.

What _is_ Creole, exactly? This is probably one of the most debated topics
among linguists worldwide – it is an incredibly complex and diverse language.
The fruit of migrations and population mingling, Creole language has been,
since the distant times of slavery, a vernacular language, either prohibited
or underrated. But things started to change in the 1980s, as explained by the
Creole-oriented Reunionese blog,
[_Renyone_](http://www.renyone.net/English/28oct_gb.htm) [Cr, Eng]:

> In 1981 scientists having Creole as their mother tongue started asking
> themselves questions about the methods that could be used to promote the
> Creole language, following a scientific symposium organised by the
> international committee for Creole studies working on the theme: a Creole /
> Creoles, continuity and creativity in the Creole world.

_Renyone_ gives more details about the establishment of what has become a
tradition in most Creolophone countries [Eng]:

> In 1982 the Seychelles government organised a Creole week.  
>  […]  
>  The first international BANNZIL KREYOL day took place on the 28th October
> 1983. Ever since, the 28th October has been celebrated annually in all
> Creole countries the world over.

Since then, the preservation of this vernacular language, sometimes called a
dialect, has been a great concern for many people as shown by this statement
of objectives published by the [International Organization of Creole
People](http://www.iocp.info/objectives.php). A Facebook group named “[Annou
Palé
Patwa](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=61220156866&topic=10911#/group.php?gid=61220156866)”
(Creole for “Let's speak Patois/Creole) relays this concern since in a topic
entitled [Creole
Month](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=61220156866&topic=10911#/topic.php?uid=61220156866&topic=10911),
a Trinidadian user wonders about this year's celebration [En]:

> Well October is Creole month the world over, what can we do to promote it in
> Trinidad?  
>  […]  
>  What do you think will be the best way to go if we were to do something
> national?

Initiatives to promote, preserve or celebrate Creole are local field work as
much as governemental policy. Here is a post published by
[Dominican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica) blogger _[Living
Dominica](http://livingdominica.blogspot.com/2007/10/it-is-almost-creole-
time.html)_ two years ago in which we can see that in some countries, this
celebration is not just a token gesture [En]:

> This month is Creole time here on Dominica, which is my very favorite
> celebration. This time of year is a festival honoring all things Dominican.
> Everyone gets into the spirit of things in the days leading up to
> Independence Day (Nov. 3) and the World Creole Music Festival (Oct. 26-28)

Mentioned above, the [World Creole Music
Festival](http://www.wcmfdominica.com/) was born 13 years ago from the
Dominican government's will to associate the International Creole Month to its
celebration of the Independence of the island on November 3rd 1978.

From all this, it is quite obvious that Creole Month and Creole Day, October
28th, are not uniformly celebrated worldwide. Here are some posts about 2009
Creole Day events:

From London, the group [_MBMB “Minm Biten, Minm Bagay”_
](http://www.mbmbcharity.com/)(Guadeloupean and Martinican Creole phrases
which mean “it's all the same”) wrote a post in order to invite people to the
event that took place on Sept. 27th 2009 and also to recall previous editions
of their “MBMB Kreyol Day”.

In Canada, the Creole-oriented organization
[_Kepkaa_](http://www.kepkaa.com/moisducreole/index.html) invites people for
“Mwa kréyol la nan Monréyal” (Haitian Creole for “Creole Month in Montreal”)
in a post entitled “Ann fété kilti kreyol nou yo” (Haitian Creole for “Let's
celebrate Creole cultures together”). Another Canadian event was announced on
_[Miss Creole Canada Pageant](http://www.misscreolecanada.com/)_ and relayed
on Facebook, it was the first of its kind, [crowning of a Miss from Creole
heritage](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=37345708168&v=wall&ref=search),
which took place on October 17th, as part of the celebration of the Creole
Month.

In Paris, blogger _[Anba pyé mango-
la](http://karucrea.blogspot.com/2009/10/tan-kreyol-transmission-
octobre-2009.html)_ announces a cultural evening called “Tan Kréyol” (Creole
for “Hear Creole”) where the oral transmission of Creole is given a place of
honor [Fr Cr]:

> Senn-la wouvè ba tout moun : poèt, chantè, slamè, makè, kontè, mizisyen… .

The mic is open to everyone: poets, singers, poetry slammers, writers,
storytellers, musicians….

In Guadeloupe, the local authorities have organized a month-long program
taking place in different locations, in order to celebrate “Mwa òktòb kréyol
an mouvman” (Creole for “October, Creole in motion). Here are the two main
points of this program posted by
_[guadeloupe.coconews](http://guadeloupe.coconews.com/actualite-
guadeloupe,mois-du-creole-mwa-oktob-kreyol-en-mouvman,1070.html)_ [Fr Cr]:

> 1\. Prèmyé dékatman ba tout moun  
>  2\. Dézyèm dékatman èvè zanfan-lékòl

1\. First session of activities opened to everyone  
2\. Second session of activities reserved to pupils and students

Finally, from Martinique,
_[montraykreyol](http://www.montraykreyol.org/spip.php?article3122)_ publishes
a post which questions the Creole Month celebration there and most precisely
the relevance of celebrating Creole in a week-long festival [Fr Cr]:

> Es ou ka kwè ki an sel simenn pou défann kréyol adan tout lanné-a sifizan ?
>
> CLAUDE MARLIN : Dapré mwen non, sa ja an pal pou kréyol-la menm manniè ki
> tout travay-la ki za fet asou lang-lan. Men fok pandan tout lanné-a, ni
> travay ki pou fet, fok véyatif toulong, pas menm si kréyol ka rantré
> latélévizion, laradio, nan piblisité kontel, bien délè sa ka an kréyol
> toubònman, tjòlòlò ek sa pé désèvi lang-la.

Do you believe that one week a year to defend Creole is enough?  
CLAUDE MARLIN : I don't think so but it's already a great thing for Creole as
everything else that has been done about the language. Yet, things must be
done all year long and we have to be careful all the time, because even when
Creole is spoken on TV, on the radio or in commercials for exemple, most of
the time it is rough or broken, which can be harmful to the integrity of the
language.
