After the political controversy that accompanied the New Year holidays in
Kazakhstan (see [earlier
report](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/05/kazakhstan-referendum-
cancelled-elections-announced/)), February 2011 has seen a return to calm.

The recent announcement of an early presidential election has brought little
excitement – the opposition will boycott the vote, other candidates are weak,
and the incumbent president is sure to secure another term after more than 20
years in office.

However, it would be too superficial to draw such parallels – not only because
Kazakhstani society is effectively controlled by a complex of measures that
include propaganda, buying-off the protest potential and continuous crackdown
on the dissent – but also because referendum, in essence, hardly differs from
elections as they are usually held in Kazakhstan.

The process of candidates nomination was perceived by many as a circus – and
it really resembled a carousel of comic characters, including pensioners, some
small businessmen and the person, notoriously known for his startling
behavior. Interestingly, an overwhelming majority of those 18 nominees were
publicly voicing their “utter support” of the current head of the state.

When the authorities realized that opposition is serious in its intention to
boycott the elections, they took the old puppet competitors of the incumbent
president – senator Gani Kassymov and environmentalist Mels Yeleusizov – back
onto the stage. Finally, these two men, president Nazarbayev and Jambyl
Akhmetbekov from the pro-government Communist People's Party, have been
registered as candidates for the race.

Young political activists Alexander Danilov and Aidos Kapanov launched a
[website](http://sailau.info/) [ru] dedicated to elections with the improvised
poll to monitor the preferences of Internet users and separate pages with some
info about the each of the candidates. Notably, those pages contain no
ideological platform or election program whatsoever – only CV-style
biographies.
