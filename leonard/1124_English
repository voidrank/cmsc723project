Bloggers and citizen journalists are reacting to the massive earthquake and
subsequent Tsunami that struck both Samoa and American Samoa, destroying
crops, property and killing an estimated 150 people.

Shortly before 7 am local time Wednesday, September 30, an earthquake
measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale hit 120 miles off Apia, Samoa’s capital.
Almost immediately giant waves at least twenty feet high hit both countries.

The shockwaves immediately spread across the Pacific, where governments and
media scrambled to warn citizens – especially those who work on the water or
those attending school or living in low-lying areas. Because of the nature of
tsunamis (they can travel about 500 miles — 800 km — per hour), and the great
distances in the Pacific, some people had to wait nearly three hours
anticipating tsunami-like waves.

However, nothing measuring the damage in Samoa or American Samoa was reported.
Eastern islands in the Fiji group
[reported](http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=130582) waves over one-foot
high just 30 minutes after the earthquake. New Zealand, some 1800 miles from
the epicenter, reported waves at 40 cm, or 15 inches.

From footage by a cameraman named Rayner W, who took a walking tour of the
damage in Leone, American Samoa.

Erica Wales, a Peace Corps volunteer in Salesatele, Samoa, is lucky to be
alive.

Then, she adds, almost in passing:

> and muddy. I’m not sure what can be salvaged. I’m going back tomorrow to
> find out what I can still use, but I know most things will be trashed.

Matt, another Peace Corps volunteer, was posting throughout the day. He takes
us through the hurry-up-and-wait reality that often goes along with a natural
disaster.

Then, Matt provides an inventory of damage to his friends’ houses.

Another Peace Corps volunteer returns to her work the day after and learns
some bad news. From the [blog](http://seereeves.blogspot.com/2009/09/tsunami-
update_4690.html) _See Reeves_ :

> I was up at 6 am as usual and saw the neighbors returning home (the entire
> family had mysteriously packed up and left the house at 10 pm last night). I
> went over to ask if their family was ok. The neighbor also happens to be the
> director of the school board, so I asked if school was still on for today.
> He said yes. So I responded to the numerous emails filling my inbox, took a
> shower and went to school.
>
> I knew right away that there were not going to be classes. The student
> population, usually more than 600, had dropped to less than 100 students.
> Every student and teacher I passed on the walk up the school drive, I asked
> if their families were ok. Moleli, the P.E. instructor, had lost three
> members of his extended family. Every one expressed their happiness to see
> me and their concern for me yesterday. I had hightailed it out of town the
> minute we got the Peace Corps evacuate message, which was before I had ever
> made it to school that day. The other teachers had worried about me.
>
> When the evacuation order had come, the school principal and three of the
> teachers had filled vehicles with students to drive them inland. While they
> were up the hill a parent of a Year 9 girl student had arrived in a van and
> picked up nine students to drive inland. On the way up the hill something
> happened with the van, it lost power and all breaks. The car began to roll
> down the hill backwards. The driver turned the wheel, thinking he should be
> facing the way the van was rolling. This sent the van flipping side over
> side down the hill. All nine students were taken to the hospital and one
> student, the driver of the van's own daughter, was killed in the accident.
>

> every student had been seen. He was extremely touched by the concern of
> visiting medical volunteers, Germaine and Imogen (possibly from Ireland or
> Scotland). Reaching into his pocket he produced the scrap of paper that
> contained their cell phone number. He told me he had called them later that
> night and had spoken with them for nearly two hours.

> Talking to the teachers I could sense the raw emotion just under the

> “Samoa will remember this day in her heart for ever,” said Moleli.
