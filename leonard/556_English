After twenty years, [elections](http://www.dvb.no/elections/usdp-
wins-%E2%80%9880-percent-of-seats%E2%80%99/12728) were held in Myanmar and as
expected the junta-backed party won with the Union Solidarity and Development
Party (USDP) getting more than 80 percent of the seats in parliament. But the
opposition is claiming that the poll results were rigged.

_The Irrawaddy's_ [Kyaw Zwa
Moe](http://www.irrawaddy.org/opinion_story.php?art_id=20017) gives a summary
of what transpired during election day

> All incumbent 27 ministers and deputy ministers of the military government
> reportedly won in the Sunday elections
>
> Of course, Prime Minister Thein Sein is among them and Foreign Minister Nyan
> Win won his constituency without a contest because he was unopposed, as were
> 52 candidates of the junta's party, the Union Solidarity and Development
> Party (USDP). You'll see a new government composed of many of these
> incumbent ministers in the coming months.

‘Joker Votes” were used to manipulate election results

> The USDP has reportedly won 82 percent of the seats in parliament. No

> knew the USDP would rig votes, but it was even worse than they expected.
>
> The USDP made a mockery of the advanced vote process. Witnesses and party

> votes.”

Believing that the election is a sham and that the junta will dictate the
results of the voting, the pro-democracy movement led by opposition icon Aung
San Suu Kyi has decided to [boycott the
elections](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/27/myanmar-boycott-
elections-campaign/).

_The Democratic Voice of Burma_ has set-up an [election
map](http://www.burma2010election.com/) to monitor cases of fraud, violence
and election protests.

party-candidate-blows-top-in-namkham&catid=85:politics&Itemid=266), writing
for the _Shan Herald_ , narrates how an administration candidate behaved
during the voting in Shan State

> “Kyaw Myint (candidate) gave money to voters in his constituency Kyat 10,000
> (US $10) each in polling station. People who got the money, came out from
> the booths with a big smile and showed us money and told they won lottery at
> the polling station.
>
> “Kyaw Myint was said to have brought over 500 ballot papers from another
> area and put into the ballot boxes to get counted.
>
> “During the election time, he also brought 80 armed militiamen to guard the
> polling booths.”

These testimonies and observations contradict the official statement of the
government which are published on _The New Light of Myanmar_. The government
is claiming that the 2010 Multiparty Democracy General Elections were held
peacefully and that visiting diplomats and journalists “viewed [free and happy
voting](http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/index.html) of people and
counting of ballots at the stations.” It added:

> “They viewed free and happy casting vote of local people, systematic
> counting of ballots and putting on records with the use of designated forms
> at the polling stations.”

Violence also erupted on electiond day when government soldiers clashed with
the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army. The fighting forced the evacuation of more
than [17,000 people](http://www.shaneabrahams.com/2010/11/refugee-numbers-
swell-to-17000/) who sought refuge near the Thailand border.
