March 18 was the [bloodiest
day](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/19/yemen-friday-massacre-in-
sanaa/) since the beginning of the uprising in Yemen, almost two months ago.
Ali Abdullah Saleh called several times for the security forces to protect
both pro and anti-government protestors. However, on the ground none of this
happened. Indeed, on Friday, armed loyalists to the Yemeni President and
security forces opened fire on peaceful protestors at Sana’a University
killing at least 46 and injuring dozens. The attack which was intended to
bring an end to a series of protests sweeping the country, has increased the
compassion with and the support for the protestors.

Ali Muhsen's move might be considered as an indication that the army might
take the side of the demonstrators and stand against Ali Abdullah Saleh.

the ruling party by military leaders, Sheikhs and personalities because of its
large number

of all those who have stepped down so far and declared their support for the
revolution. Hameer Al-Ahmer, the Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies,
the Yemeni ambassador to Czech Republic, Head of the Yemeni Television, and
Governor of Aden are on this long list.  
The series of resignations are regarded as a hint for the near end of the
33-year regime of Ali Abdullah Saleh.
