As Japanese authorities are scrambling to contain the on-going [nuclear
crisis](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/) in the quake and tsunami hit Fukushima, governments in its
neighboring countries are fighting to control the spread of something equally
dangerous – hoax messages that sow unfounded fear and panic in the public
about Japan's nuclear problems.

In the Philippines, it all started with a hoax message which circulated via
SMS warning the public to stay indoors, swab iodine on their necks and avoid
getting caught in the acid rain that was allegedly caused by radioactive
material that leaked from Japan's damaged nuclear power plants.

The hoax message soon leaked into social networking sites like Facebook and
Twitter. However, bloggers were quick in coming out to prove that the messages
were false and expose it as such.

[_Rungitom_](http://rungitom.blogspot.com/2011/03/nuclear-radiation-hoax.html)
dissects the message point-by-point to prove it's a hoax:

> Why is it a hoax again? Here are the reasons:
>
>   * The plume from the site of the incident will not pass Philippine
> territory as of March 14.
>   * It does not make sense because the location of the explosion is too far,
> so it does not affect the local rainfall.
>   * The wind pattern in Japan showed that the Philippines are unlikely to be
> hit by any radioactive fallout from Fukushima.
>   * Acid rain is formed when gaseous substances like sulphur and nitrogen
> mix and react with water in the clouds. Radioactive materials were in metal
> form so it would not react with water.

[_Ralph at Trunk Locker_](http://trunklocker.blogspot.com/2011/03/disaster-in-
japan-dont-worsen-it.html) joins the chorus of bloggers appealing to everyone
not to simply forward messages via SMS without taking time to check on the
facts or veracity of the information:

> And please if you received the text message, don’t spread it and might as
> well tell the person who passed it to you that it wasn’t true. In times of
> crisis, we Filipinos must learn from the Japanese… they were bombarded with
> calamities… first was the earthquake, then the tsunami and now the impending
> danger of radiation exposure due to damaged nuclear power plant… but they
> remained calm… they remained disciplined. It was said in the news that they
> were waiting in line for their turn to receive relief goods and there were
> no reported robbing in shops and grocery stores. All praises to them.

However, some like [Tiffany Ann Amores-
Amortizado](http://radiantbrown.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/whatta-scare/), may
have doubted the message after doing her own search on the Internet, but still
chose to err on the side of caution:

> As a mother of 3 young children, I am a known worrier. And to take necessary
> or UNnecessary precautions, I WILL PLAY IT SAFE and stay indoors for at
> least 24 hours.

Still on the other hand [_Blogged
Philippines_](http://www.bloggedphilippines.com/2011/03/fukushima-radiation-
leak-hoax-our-take.html) argues that playing safe isn't really safe:

> Some may argue that they just followed what the SMS said because its better
> to be safe. Yes, that saying is absolutely true if the definition of “safe”
> is clear. In the case of the Fukushima radiation hoax, how many of us is
> sure that putting an iodine solution in our thyroid will protect us against
> radiation? Whether it will help or not, I don't know. What I know is that
> I'm not sure about it. What if the opposite is true, and putting an iodine
> solution in your necks will even worsen the case? The point is, before
> making a decision, make sure that you have FACTS.
>
> In the case of the Fukushima Radiation Hoax, the damage is not big. That's
> something we should be thankful for. It only resulted to people staying at
> home, suspended classes, and an increase in the sale of “betadine” solution.
> :-). But think about this: What if the message instead requires a more
> drastic action? Will you do it?

In an effort to genuinely help out, Korhz shared some tips on [how to be
prepared](http://cloverxxkorhz.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/be-prepared/) when one
gets caught in disasters like an earthquake or a nuclear event.

[_Juan Republic_](http://juanrepublic.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/mighty-hoax-
and-the-pinoy-culture-of-chismis/) dug deeper into the hoax message,
illustrating how Filipino culture with its penchant for gossip have
contributed to how it got so viral:

> It all started with a chismis – an unconfirmed text message that was
> repeatedly forwarded because of fear. Whoever was the one behind this
> fiasco, he succeeded. He induced fear and changed the normal routine of some
> of the Filipinos. He created an instant talk-of-the town. Or if he did it
> for fun, for sure, he laughed his ass out.
>
> It’s just so disappointing that some idiots grab the opportunity of a
> disaster to create something stupid and for self-gratification.
>
> Should our chismis culture be blamed? Our love for showbiz-oriented shows
> and tabloid-liked stories may be a factor.
>
> …
>
> Unfortunately, they passed the wrong message.
>
> And the rest was an infamous story.
>
> With today’s technology, news and information can be delivered faster. But
> technology doesn’t give us accuracy or veracity instantly.

Then there's this satirical piece on _Mosquito Press_ hitting back at
Filipinos, sharply pointing out that being easily affected by hoaxes is due to
their ‘[exceptional
gullibility](http://mosquitopress.net/post/3854901510/harvard-study-finds-
that-filipinos-are-the-worlds-most).’
