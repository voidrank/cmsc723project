Brad Rice at Japanator [sums up](http://www.japanator.com/hatoyama-announces-

Esquire [expresses](http://esquire.air-nifty.com/blog/2010/06/post-5c88.html)
his criticism at the attitude of the Japanese media, who tend to give voice
only to words of the discontent without reporting any of the government's
positive results, when there are any. The blogger also invites his fellow
citizens to take responsibility as voters, because the government that has
failed is one they themselves voted for.

>
> なぜならば、安倍政権以降、福田、麻生、鳩山とこういった短期政権としてしまっている最大の原因が、マスメディア、ひいては有権者である我々にあることを自覚すべきと考えるからです。  
>  安倍、福田、麻生、鳩山に対し、我々は十分な時間と猶予を与え、それぞれの政権の行った成果の部分を正当に評価してきたでしょうか。

The media and we, the voters, should not forget that the fall of these short-
lived governments — those of Abe, Fukuda, Aso and Hatoyama — is largely our
fault.

Have we truly evaluated the results of these governments fairly, and given
them — Abe, Fukuda, Aso and Hatoyama — enough time to really prove themselves?

[…]

> 結局のところ、我々有権者は、「良くも悪くも自分たちが選んだ政権だ」という意識が非常に薄弱です。

The problem is that voters have very little awareness of the fact that for
better or worse, these are governments that _they_ chose.

[…]

>
> 責任ある有権者になるためには、次の総理が発する発言一つ一つを自分の耳と目で見聞きし、残りの衆議院の任期中にきちんとした成果を出してくれる人物なのかを自分の頭で考えることが必要だと思います。

To become responsible voters, we must watch and listen with our eyes and ears
every sentence uttered by the new prime minister. In the period leading up to
the next elections in the House of Representatives, we must use our brains and
evaluate whether he is someone who can produce concrete results while in
office.

Last Minute Advice. By Roberto De Vido. CC License

On Friday, the DPJ elected [Naoto
Kan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_Kan), former deputy prime minister and
finance minister, as its new representative. Kan will officially become prime
minister only after the Emperor proclaims him so at the Imperial Investiture
ceremony to be held next week.

Many in Japan remember Kan as the one who, while minister of Health in 1996,
exposed a scandal involving HIV-tainted blood that bureaucrats in his own
ministry had been attempting to cover up.

Tobias Harris at Observing Japan [considers Kan's credentials and
character](http://www.observingjapan.com/2010/06/virtues-of-kan.html) as a
political leader:

> Given that he is a conviction politician, given his ministerial experience
> (something that Hatoyama lacked), and given his emphasis on open politics,
> Kan may be the right man to restore public trust in the DPJ-led government
> and lead his party to a respectable showing in next month's upper house
> election. The central task for the Hatoyama government was the restore
> public faith in government after years of LDP misrule. The central task for
> a Kan government would be to restore public faith in government after years
> of LDP misrule — and nine months of Hatoyama misrule. If the public does not
> trust the government, it is difficult to see how Japan will escape its
> economic stagnation. As I've said before, if the public cannot trust the
> government to be honest about its intentions and forthright about how public
> money is spent, no government will be in a position to ask for something
> like a consumption tax increase.

At _Sora wo Minagara_ , a blogger
[recalls](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/e-iso/e/1cfa9a1d509d0df09cf7dbefd42b17d0 sora
wo minagara) Kan's political activity when he was young:

> 菅さんは、若いときから、政治に関わってきた。その姿勢や良し、彼の手腕に大いに期待したい。  
>
> 政権交代の、本当の意味が、いよいよ始まるという予感がある。政治が本当に弱者のサイドに眼が行き、国民第一の政治が、どのように、展開されていくのか、また、誰が、どのように、これに挑んでくるのか、よくよく、国民は見抜かなければならない。

Since he was young, Mr. Kan has always committed himself in politics. He has a
good attitude, and is very capable. I expect great things from him.

I have the feeling that a change of government, a real one, is about to start.
Politics is really shifting its perspective to the weaker side, and the
citizens will have to watch carefully to see how this citizen-oriented
politics develops, who takes up the challenge and how.

Ikeda Nobuo, professor of economics and popular commentator and blogger,
[expresses his doubts](http://agora-web.jp/archives/1026246.html) regarding
the election of Kan. Ikeda fears that the influence of politicians such as
[Ichiro
Ozawa](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6816370.ece)
[en] , whose involvement in a high-profile scandal has been seen by many as
one of the causes of the decline in popularity of the ruling party, will drag
the DPJ down into a spiral of failures.

>
> 民主党は過去の失敗に学び、小沢氏の影響力を断ち切って自前の政権を構築すべきです。このまま政治が迷走して問題を先送りしていると、財政破綻などの取り返しのつかない事態になります。具体的に誰が望ましいかはわかりませんが、anyone
> but Kanです。

The DPJ should learn from its mistakes of the past, build its own government
and rid itself of Ozawa's influence. If the status quo continues, with
politics straying off course and problems endlessly postponed, then we will
ultimately find ourselves in a financial catastrophe from which recovery will
be impossible. I can't really say who would be the best candidate would be,
but [what I can say is]: anyone but Kan.

With Hatoyama's government having fallen only 8 months after its formation,
Japanese people, like the blogger at _[Yukkuri
Nonbiri](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/mdl1993/e/b06183e59b56b122785db3ece2195294)_ ,
wonder if they have at last found their Mr. Right with Kan:

> 菅首相誕生  
>  明るい未来は  
>  来るのだろうか

The Kan Government is born  
But I wonder,  
will it bring a brighter future?
