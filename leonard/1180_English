The [14th Budapest Pride Parade](http://budapestpride.hu/en) was held last
Saturday. The parade was one of the closing events of the LGBT film and
culture festival which began on Aug. 30. Because of the violent attacks that
took place in 2007 and 2008, the 14th Pride March was under increased police
protection.

Eva S. Balogh of _Hungarian Spectrum_
[wrote](http://esbalogh.typepad.com/hungarianspectrum/2009/09/gay-pride-
parade-in-hungary.html) about the tense atmosphere preceding the closing
event:

> […] Within a few days the atmosphere became sufficiently tense that a

> Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The statement read

Saturday gave a lot of work to the Hungarian police since that was also the
day when Hungary played against Sweden in a World Cup qualifying football
game. _IndymediaCalling_ [posted this
report](http://indymediacall.blogspot.com/2009/09/budapest-pride-
parade-2009.html):

> […] The only positive thing about 2008 Pride was high attention of the media

> parallel streets were closed and surrounded by fences. Basically, a big part

> Moreover, this day was a football match between Hungary and Sweden and most

> recommended to go to Blaha Lujza by metro.

_Hungarian Spectrum_ also had [a report on the
march](http://esbalogh.typepad.com/hungarianspectrum/2009/09/gay-pride-parade-
in-hungary-2009.html). Former prime minister of Hungary, Ferenc Gyurcsány,
participated, too, but he left the parade with his wife before the end of the
event through a station of the yellow metro line:

> […] There were about 1,000 participants including former prime minister
> Ferenc Gyurcsány and his wife; Tamás Bauer, former SZDSZ member of
> parliament; Mátyás Eörsi, SZDSZ MP; Péter Kende, writer; and András Léderer,
> former president of SZDSZ's New Generation. In addition there were
> representatives of Amnesty International, Democratic Charta, and other civic
> organizations. This was the first public appearance of the former prime
> minister since his resignation in March. […] I'm not sure how the police
> managed to keep the anti-gay groups outside the cordon but they were
> successful although trouble started even before the parade began. It was a
> relatively small group at Hősök tere but loud enough. First they used all
> sorts of four-letter words against gays and Jews, and when they discovered
> Gyurcsány in the crowd they had a few kind words for him as well. […]

Thanks to the increased and extended protection of the police, the marchers
could enjoy the parade without facing the groups of counter-demonstrators.

Here are links to two video reports from the parade: in [the first
one](http://www.noltv.hu/video/1836.html), people talk (HUN, ENG) about why
it's important to participate in events like this, while [the second
one](http://www.noltv.hu/video/1837.html) – titled “ **100% hetero** ” –
features the police and the anti-gay crowd.

_IndymediaCalling_
[concluded](http://indymediacall.blogspot.com/2009/09/budapest-pride-
parade-2009.html) that the parade of 2009 as a mostly peaceful event:

> […] To the Pride 2009 itself: there were a number of groups and individual
> people from both Hungary and abroad. The opening speeches were delivered by
> Juris Lavrikovs, Paata Sabelashvili (ILGA Europe) who welcomed the
> participants and shared their thoughts of the importance of the Pride. There
> were two cars with sound systems, a group of people carrying a rainbow flag,
> and a number of smaller groups including Amnesty-Hungary (the yellow group)
> and the pink-black bloc.
>
> Overall, it was just another good opportunity for queer people to claim for
> their right for equality and for their supporters to express their
> solidarity. Hopefully, the peacefulness of Pride Parade 2009 will become a
> good tradition and the tolerance in Hungarian society to queer people will
> grow to the level that no fences will be needed in the future. […]

The vigilant blogger of _Hungarian Spectrum_
[reported](http://esbalogh.typepad.com/hungarianspectrum/2009/09/gay-pride-
parade-in-hungary-2009.html) on the riots around the protected pride march and
the [closing party](http://www.budapestpride.hu/en/rainbow-
party-2009-superheroes-pride) later at Corvintető (“Corvin Rooftop”), at Blaha
Lujza Square:

> […] However, farther down the road there were a few hundred demonstrators
> who tried to break through the cordon at Octogon. Again, they didn't
> succeed. The participants apparently weren't even aware of the upheaval
> outside the cordoned off area. By 4:30 about 300-400 people gathered at Deák
> tér where they attacked the police, and here the police had to use tear gas.
> The crowd began to disperse but unfortunately they then lingered in
> neighboring streets, including Dohány utca where the famous Budapest
> synagogue is situated. One can imagine what happened afterward. They called
> the Jews all sorts of names and tore down posters advertising the Jewish
> Summer Festival. All this was done while these savages were carrying
> Hungarian flags. How patriotic. Not far from Dohány utca there is the
> Astoria Hotel where another group gathered that began going along Rákóczi út
> to Corvin Department Store whose flat roof is used for all sorts of parties.
> Apparently some of the gays were planning to hold a party there. While about
> 150 people were gathering in front of the department store battling with the
> police, on Deák tér about 200 people were throwing bottles and rocks at the
> police and broke the windows of at least one car. Altogether 11 people were
> arrested. Some of these “gentlemen” apparently beat a young woman who wore a
> T-shirt identifying her as a participant in the parade. She was waiting for
> the street car when three men appeared from the underground passage in front
> of Astoria and, without saying a word, began to beat her. Because of the
> blows the woman fell on the ground. So, for good measure they kicked her
> several times. She suffered head and arm injuries. […]

According to [The Budapest
Times](http://www.budapesttimes.hu/content/view/12919/159/) police have
initiated legal proceedings against 17 people for violence against officers,
and altogether 41 people were detained for various reasons including
disobeying police, endangering public safety and carrying explosive materials
in various parts of the city. The gay march, attended by some 1,500 people and
secured by iron fences and a large number of police, ended without major
incidents.

And Sweden defeated Hungary. 2:1.
