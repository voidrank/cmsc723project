On Friday, March 11, 2011 at 2:46:23 p.m. local time, [an 8.9-magnitude
earthquake struck Japan](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/11/largest-
earthquake-in-recorded-history-in-japan/), the largest in recorded history.

It's been more than 5 hours since the earthquake hit, and many Tokyoites are
still trying to get home on foot. The train system shut down for the day.
