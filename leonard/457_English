fateful day, adding:

everywhere on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, BBm) today”, explaining:

The blog also posts the reflections of a member of the Haitian diaspora,
[here](http://blog.karljeanjeune.com/2011/01/11/i-remember-it-was-painful-i-

On Twitter, the hashtags for the one-year anniversary of the earthquake are
[#remember #Haiti](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23remember%20%23Haiti) – and
Tweeple have been using the micro-blogging platform to do just that:

Indeed, [@RAMHaiti](http://twitter.com/#!/RAMhaiti) posted several tweets
about the inauguration of the rebuilt Iron Market:

> [WOW!!! The New Iron Market!! Thank you Denis O'Brien and #Digicel
> http://twitpic.com/3p5nau](http://twitter.com/#!/RAMhaiti/status/24913064377720832)

> Market inauguration Port au Prince
> #Haiti](http://twitter.com/#!/RAMhaiti/status/24921206981398528)

…and a few about the stark contrast of the new facility to other areas of the
capital:

> [Driving around downtown Port au Prince. Don't recognize where I am.. #Haiti
> #EarthQuake](http://twitter.com/#!/RAMhaiti/status/24960027374649345)

Today, whether it was through [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/carelpedre),
[poetry](http://tandenou2.blogspot.com/2011/01/12-janvye-2010.html) or
[suggestions](http://blogs.concernusa.org/2011/01/12/haiti-emergency-8/) about
ways in which to move forward, there is no doubt that this sad anniversary was
top of mind in the regional blogosphere. Perhaps [Shelley
Clay](http://apparentproject.blogspot.com/2011/01/12th.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheApparentProjectBlog+%28The+Apparent+Project+Blog%29)
sums it up best – today is important to remember because it is about the
Haitian people:

> It is January 12th. A baby is coming into the world today. A country is on
> her knees today. I will spend my day waiting for news of a boy or girl,
> probably go down to see the beautiful Iron Market, probably cry a little,
> hug my kids a lot, and remember what happened one year ago. God Bless Haiti
> this year!
