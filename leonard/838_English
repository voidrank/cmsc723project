The second semester started three weeks ago at Hungarian universities. It's
not an easy thing going to school again after a capricious period full of
exams, and now it has even become annoying for some. Students of [Corvinus
University of Budapest](http://www.uni-corvinus.hu/index.php?id=7745) have
already experienced three bomb alerts so far in this semester. After the third
one, this week they started to campaign against the unknown person blocking
the university's life with calls reporting a bomb was placed somewhere on the
campus.

The students of Corvinus considered the act totally incomprehensible and
uncomfortable. Tymi of _Szappanopera_ blog wrote a
[post](http://szappan.blog.hu/2010/02/24/bombariado_oh_csak_a_szokasos) (HUN)
titled “Bomb Alert? Oh… just the usual!” on Wednesday:

However the events raised awareness among students to use social networks and
micro-blogging sites more frequently to be informed in time. Corvinyusz of
_Corvinull blog_ blamed the communication of the university in her [
post](http://corvinull.blog.hu/2010/02/24/bombariado_a_corvinuson) (HUN). She
also started a [poll](http://poll-r.hu/poll/1017769) (HUN) about what kind of
medium would the students prefer for instant communication from the
university.

> […] And what is missing on behalf of the university? THE COMMUNICATION! From

Gesa and Laura are two exchange students at Corvinus, they also published
their Facebook activity on their
[blog](http://lauragesa.blogspot.com/2010/02/bomb-threat-3-at-corvinus-
university.html) to demonstrate how the bomb alert made them upset:

> Today we had bomb threat number 3 in 3 weeks so far. We are not sure what's
> going on in this city and with this school, but we are getting a little
> annoyed. If random students call in all the time, can they not call in 5
> days in the row. Then we could at least go on vacation for one week! […]
>
> Lauras Status: _Laura Baum_ Bomb threat number 3! I'm here for 3 weeks now.
> Means 1 bomb threat every week. Where the hell are we?!?! […]

Corvinus students tweeted information about the bomb alert by the hashtags
[Corvinus](http://twitter.com/#search?q=corvinus) and
[bombariadó](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23bombariado) (‘bomb alert’), and
started Facebook groups dealing with the topic. For example against the one
who distracts them from studying: [Legyen bombariadó a Corvinuson bombariadót
csináló
lakásában!!!](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&ref=search&gid=347654677007)
(HUN) (“Make a bomb alert in the apartment of the one who makes bomb alert at
Corvinus!!!”). Another one is [Bombariadó van? Haha,dejó.//Megint??
Najo,visszafekszem.//MEGINT???
F*szom](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bombariado-van-HahadejoMegint-
NajovisszafekszemMEGINT-Fszom/323337982262) demonstrates the levels the
students have gone through from having fun of extra free time for sleeping to
being totally annoyed. And another group promotes online communication among
students: [I check my e-mail before going to school, to make sure there's no
bomb alert](http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-check-my-e-mail-before-going-to-
school-to-make-sure-theres-no-
bombalert/325242019764?ref=mf&v=info#!/pages/I-check-my-e-mail-before-going-
to-school-to-make-sure-theres-no-bombalert/325242019764?v=wall&ref=mf).
