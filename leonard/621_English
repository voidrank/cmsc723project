Financial data and figures say Japan has now fallen to number three in world
ranking.  
This month the Japanese government admitted that [China has stolen its
thunder](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/16/china-gdp-rising-public-
spending-too/) [en] becoming the second largest economy after the US, as
official figures showed that Japan’s gross domestic product was US$1.28
trillion in the second quarter against China's US$1.33 trillion.

But this announcement hasn't surprised many Japanese people who had been
expecting it to happen sooner or later.  
The buzz that media created about Japan being beaten by its Asian neighbor has
made many bloggers raise their eyebrows and say: so what?

Ampontan, for instance,
[warns](http://ampontan.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/enough-bubbles-to-take-a-
bath/) that China becoming the second largest economy in the world is nothing
but a bubble that will eventually burst.

Japan emerged as economic superpower in 1968, when it became the second
largest economy in the world, surpassing West Germany.  
The “economic miracle” as defined by [some
scholars](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Japan+Since+1945:+The+Rise+of+an+Economic+Superpower.-a019273208)
[en] was caused by multiple factors including postwar reforms and a high level
of industrialization fostered by
‘[keiretsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu)’ [en], a partnership of
Government and private industry.  
Nowadays Japan, with a population which is only one tenth of greater China's
population, has a [public debt to GDP ratio of about
200%](http://www.globaleconomiccrisis.com/blog/archives/1084) and a mere 0.1%
economic growth rate.

Takaojisan [thinks](http://takaojisan.blog13.fc2.com/blog-entry-276.html) it’s
natural that the Chinese GDP passes Japan's as the population is bigger. But
he also shares with Ampontan the opinion that the story that China is going to
be the largest economy in the near future may go up in smoke.

> 単純に考え、日本の１０倍の人口がいるから日本の１０倍の購買力があるなどはあり得ず、結局は一部の富裕層が買いあさっているに過ぎない。中国のGDPは、個人消費ではなく、行き場のない金が向かっている投資によるところが大きい。そして、その投資がはじければ、中国の巨大な経済は一夜にして水泡に帰するのだ。なにしろ、経済の実体となりうる個人消費がきわめて限られ、インフラが整備されず、国民生活を支える有形無形の社会サービスがまったく形成されていないからだ。  
>  つまり中国の投資バブルがはじけた場合の崩壊はすさまじいと言える。まさに、実体のない経済が雲散霧消するのだ。[…]  
>  しかし、いずれ日本を経済規模で抜いたとしても、べつにそれがどうと言うことではないのだ。

Simply put, just because China has ten times the population of Japan, it does
not necessarily follow that its purchasing power is also ten times greater,
because it’s only a part of the wealthy class there that can buy as much as
they like.  
The Chinese GDP doesn’t depend on personal consumption but on the investments
based on money that couldn’t be spent on anything else.  
If those investments fail, China’s huge economy would evaporate. The reason
why is that personal consumption, which may become the mainstay of its
economy, is limited. The infrastructure is not well maintained and social
services that support the citizens physically and socially aren’t organized at
all.  
In other words, the collapse if China’s investment bubble burst would be
awful. An economy lacking a consistent base would vanish into thin air. […]  
However, even if [China’s] economy passed the Japanese economy in scale, then
what?

In addition to the figures that prove China’s economy being greater than the
Japanese, [experts
forecast](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/business/global/16yuan.html) [en]
that this growing power will eventually pass also the US by 2030, becoming
then the largest economy in the whole world.

Blogger aen_ukon99
[wonders](http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/aen_ukon99/32827405.html) what are the
factors considered by the experts when examining a country's economic
performance.

> それに中国に生産拠点を移した多くの外国企業の生産はカウントされていないのかな？  
>
> そして安い労働力の供給元だった中国がこの頃自殺者やストなどで目覚め始めて多くの企業はインドやアフリカに移りつつあるって中国にとっては結構痛い話じゃ無いのかな。

I wonder whether they take into account the output of the numerous foreign
companies that moved their production centers to China?  
Also, China which has been providing a cheap labor force so far is starting to
become aware of problems such as suicide and strikes which have made many
companies move to India or Africa. This will become a sensitive issue for
China won’t it?

More positive thinkers, like[
Bos](http://blog.golfdigest.co.jp/user/0066/archive/1457), have taken the news
as a reason to look ahead and help their country to utilize those values and
strengths that made of it a world power in just a few decades.

China’s change in position is something that had to happen, there’s nothing we
can do about it. However, we should strive to do our best and use our
attitude, spirit and knowledge in order that Japan does not fall any further…
