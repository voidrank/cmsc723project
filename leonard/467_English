More big news from the Arab world this evening as Lebanon's government has
reportedly collapsed, following the resignations of 11 cabinet members. The
cabinet members, all members or allies of Hezbollah, resigned over arguments
stemming from a UN probe into the assassination of former Lebanese prime
minister [Rafiq
Hariri](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Rafic_Hariri), _Al
Jazeera_
[reported](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011112151356430829.html).

Bloggers and Twitter users picked up on the news quickly, announcing it just
after the first news reports from inside Lebanon broke. _Al Jazeera_
correspondent Dima Khatib (@[dima_khatib](http://twitter.com/dima_khatib))
[Tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/Dima_Khatib/status/25218479745409025) around
6pm Beirut time:

> Lebanese government is officially down, lost legal quorom, while PM Hariri
> is at White House with Obama.
> [#Lebanon](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Lebanon "#Lebanon")

Shortly after Dima's Tweet, Chan Bhatia of _Chicks Gone
Tech_[blogged](http://www.chicksgonetech.com/2011/01/hezbollah-allies-quit-
lebanons-unity-government/):

> **[Updated at 11:13 a.m.] [ _ed note: EST_ ] **Lebanon's unity government
> collapsed Wednesday after Minister of State Adnan Sayyed Hussein turned in
> his resignation, the 11th Cabinet member to do so.

It didn't take long for Lebanese “tweeps” to start sharing their thoughts and
opinions on Twitter. @[LebaneseVoices](http://twitter.com/LebaneseVoices)
[remarked](http://twitter.com/#!/LebaneseVoices/status/25228112803401731) in
two Tweets:

> government or no government, we still have no infrastructure
> [#Lebanon](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Lebanon "#Lebanon")
>
> government or no government, we still have repetitive violations of israeli
> planes in our skies. [#Lebanon](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Lebanon

[commented](http://twitter.com/#!/emile_hokayem/status/25209025872273408) on
the perception of the resignations:

> Opposition ministers chose to resign while PM Hariri is in Washington. Using
> his absence to say he does not care about Lebanon.

Some on Twitter, like @[LSal92](http://twitter.com/LSal92), took a more
cynical approach in light of Lebanon's recent history,
[Tweeting](http://twitter.com/#!/LSal92/status/25256907287560192):

> So are we without a government again? What's new?
