Outgoing Brazilian president Luis Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) was
[interviewed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2iOZOmaNqo&feature=player_embedded)
[pt] for the first time this week by a range of progressive bloggers, an event
seen by many as a [major
step](http://www.correiocidadania.com.br/content/view/5234/9/) [pt] in the
ongoing push for a more [democratic media
system](http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/artigos.asp?cod=617IPB003)
[pt] in the country.

The two hour session was also streamed online, allowing bloggers to
participate via webcam through microblogging site,
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com).

A [range of
topics](http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/temas/politica/2010/11/serei-muito-
mais-defensor-da-reforma-politica-diz-lula) [pt] were covered, including
political reform within Brazil, abortion, education, corruption, and the
country's foreign policy.

Media reform was particularly high on the agenda, with Lula affirming,

> Eu sou o resultado da liberdade de imprensa neste país. A maior censura que
> existe é acreditar que a mídia não pode ser criticada.

I am the result of freedom of the press in this country. The greatest
censorship that exists is to believe that the media cannot be criticised.

He rallied against the spread of misinformation and called for a tighter
regulation of Brazil's media industry. He criticised Brazil's mainstream press
for arousing fear by exaggerating the extent to which the country would be
affected by the global financial crisis, and for reporting false causes behind
the [TAM Airlines plane
crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAM_Airlines_Flight_3054) in 2007.

Brazil's mainstream media remains in the hands of few reigning families, chief
among them being the Marinho family, which owns the country's major
broadcasting network, [_Rede Globo_](http://redeglobo.globo.com/) [pt].
Historically in close association with the military dictatorship (1964-84),
_Globo_ has been well-poised to consolidate and exert its control in
television, film, radio and print.

Newspapers have frequently come under fire for serving political interests,
most recently in the country's presidential elections, during which current
president-elect, Dilma Rousseff, was largely seen as having been the
[victim](http://www.blogcidadania.com.br/2010/09/planos-contra-dilma-e-o-
acordo-com-os-%E2%80%9Crussos%E2%80%9D/) [pt] of a mainstream media massacre.
Major dailies and magazines [swooped into the runoff
debate](http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/media-enters-brazils-presidential-
election-duel), capitalising on controversial issues, such as religion and
abortion, which leave Brazil fiercely divided.

The outgoing president was quizzed over the proposals made at last year's
first [National Conference of
Communication](http://blog.planalto.gov.br/conheca-as-propostas-aprovadas-
pela-1%C2%AA-confecom/) [pt]. The need for more extensive regulation, citizen
participation and social control within mainstream media were among the
[proposals drafted at the
conference,](http://www.intervozes.org.br/noticias/propostas-da-confecom-sao-
debatidas-na-camara) with Lula reassuring bloggers that they will be submitted
to Brazil's Congress. He added that the debate was now in the hands of Dilma,
who [pledged greater press
freedom](http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/brazil%E2%80%99s-future-
president-dilma-rousseff-promises-press-freedom) in Brazil during her
acceptance speech on 31st October.

For those who attended, the session signalled the opening a new channel of a
more progressive communication between decision makers and non-mainstream
media forces. One web user, participating via Twitcam, called the session
[“emotional”](http://lauravive.blogspot.com/2010/11/entrevista-de-lula-aos-
blogueiros.html) [pt]. Notable political blogger [Rodrigo
Vianna](http://www.rodrigovianna.com.br/plenos-poderes/lula-anuncia-serei-
blogueiro-serei-tuiteiro.html) [pt], while reminding readers that “old” media
would still remain, said,

> Não sei se os leitores têm dimensão do que isso significa: quebrou-se o
> monopólio. Internautas puderam perguntar, via twitter. O mundo da
> comunicação se moveu. Foi simbólico o que vimos hoje.

I don't know if readers get the dimensions of what this means: the monopoly
has broken. Via Twitter, Internet users could ask questions. The world of
communication moved. What we saw today was symbolic.

Renato Rovai, editor of liberal current affairs magazine [_Revista
Forum_](http://www.revistaforum.com.br/) [pt], was equally
[positive](http://www.revistaforum.com.br/blog/2010/11/24/blogueiros-com-lula-
uma-entrevista-para-historia-politica-brasileira/) [pt]:

> Ela entra para a história da cobertura política brasileira.

It [the interview] entered the history of the coverage of Brazilian politics.

The very group of bloggers invited to attend was also significant, writes
participant [Leandro
Fortes](http://brasiliaeuvi.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/lula-entre-os-sujos/)
[pt]:

> Esse mesmo grupo foi chamado por Serra, no auge da baixaria da campanha
> eleitoral, de representantes de “blogs sujos”, uma referência nervosa a um
> tipo de mídia que pegou o tucano, uma criatura artificialmente sustentada
> pela velha mídia corporativa, no contrapé. Nem Serra, nem ninguém na velha
> direita brasileira estavam preparados para o poder de reação, análise e
> crítica da blogosfera e das redes sociais. Matérias falsas, reportagens
> falaciosas, discursos hipócritas, obscurantismo religioso e a farsa da
> bolinha de papel, tudo, tudo foi desmontado em poucas horas dentro da
> internet. Chamar-nos de “sujos” nem de longe nos alcançou como ofensa, pelo
> contrário. Nós, os “sujos” fizemos a história dessa eleição. Serra e seus
> brucutus terceirizados sumiram no ralo virtual.

This very same group was called by Serra, at the peak of the immoral election
campaign, the voices of “sordid blogs”, making a nerve-racking reference to
the type of media which caught the toucan [a term for Serra], an artificial
creature supported by the old media, on the back foot. Neither Serra, nor
anyone in the old Brazilian right-wing expected the power of reaction,
analysis and criticism of the blogosphere and other social networks. Fake
articles, fallacious reports, hypocritical discourses, religious obscurantism
and the [bolinha de papel](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/22/brazil-
jose-serra-struck-by-paper-ball/) farce were unveiled within a few hours on
the Internet. We, the “sordids” made the history of this elecetion. Serra and
his pre-historic outsourced friends disappeared in the virtual drain.

Participants were, however, quick to point out the session's failures. Vianna
noted that pressing issues of human rights, land reform, justice and public
health were not covered in enough detail, overshadowed instead by the
discussion of communications. Also lamented was the absence of female
bloggers, although Conceição Oliveira, of the blog _[Maria
Fro](http://mariafro.com.br/wordpress/) _[pt] (who also blog as Conceição
Lemes at [Vi o Mundo](http://www.viomundo.com.br/)) [pt] __ participated via
[Twitcam](http://twitcam.livestream.com/).

Lula seemed convinced of the power of engaging with citizens through social
media, promising he will blog and tweet in the future. Brazil has the [second-
highest amount of Twitter users in the
world](http://blogs.aljazeera.net/americas/2010/11/16/media-relation-brazils-
election) after the United States, and its Internet users straddle anywhere
between [67 to 73
million.](http://blogs.aljazeera.net/americas/2010/11/16/media-relation-
brazils-election) Social networking sites such as
[Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/) and, to a lesser extent,
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), also remain wildly
[popular](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/15/brazil-social-networking-
world-champions/).
