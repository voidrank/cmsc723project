Today, Friday 13 May, 2011, saw change sweeping across the political landscape
of [West Bengal](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/West_Bengal),
India's fourth most populous state. [Mamata
Banerjee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee), leader of the [All
India Trinamool Congress Party (TMC)](http://www.aitmc.org/), proved all
skeptics wrong and swept into power, ending the 34 year long [Communist
rule](http://cpim.org/) in the state. Her party won 186 of 274 seats in the
ongoing assembly elections, and together with allies, now commands 227 seats,
heralding a decisive, landslide victory.

What was more, the Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself lost his
seat to the TMC candidate by over 16,000 votes and resigned soon after,
accepting “the verdict of the people”. After a 13-year long wait, Mamata
Banerjee is on her way to becoming the [first woman Chief Minister of West
Bengal](http://twitter.com/#!/rezwan/status/69043203671728129).

Throughout the day, the city wore a holiday look. The roads were pretty empty
as most people sat glued to their televisions, following the vote-counting
updates and analysis on a minute by minute basis. The entire state was abuzz
with anticipation – “Will she? Won't she?”.

By afternoon the mandate was clear. The Communist Party had been routed, not
only in West Bengal but also in Kerala – another of their bastions.

Netizens too were abuzz with the historic news. Tweets poured in fast and
furious – some congratulatory and others hoping that the change eventually
will be translated into positive action and good governance. Some also
expressed concerns in this regard.

On the ground, there was jubilation and celebration among the TMC party
workers and their allies and supporters. The mood in the party offices of the
Left told it's own story.
