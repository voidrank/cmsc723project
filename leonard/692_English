Soccer fans gathered in bars and restaurants around the globe to watch the
final game of the World Cup last night. In Uganda, these celebrations were
interrupted when bombs exploded at two popular nightlife spots in Kampala, the
country's capital.

Ugandan media are
[reporting](http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/956230/-/x22qm4/-/)
over 40 deaths so far, with dozens more injured in the explosions. Ugandan
police have [suggested](http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/725545) that Somali
militant group al-Shabab was behind the attacks. One of the group's commanders
[recently called](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/11/uganda-bomb-world-
cup_n_642336.html) for attacks against Uganda, which contributes troops to the
African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia. The group has praised the attacks
but has not claimed responsibility.
