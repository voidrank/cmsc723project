What happens when cultures collide? One of the best places to find out is the
Ethiopian blogosphere, with its writers spread across the Ethiopian Diaspora,
from China, through Europe to the United States of America.

Bloggers spent the past few weeks writing posts inspired by the differences
between Ethiopia and the far-flung nations which many Ethiopians now call
home.

Zewge A. Assefa, the writer behind _Negere Ethiopia_ , was unnerved when he
first moved to Norway as a student. At first, he wrote in [First impression is
not always the lasting one](http://negerethiopia.blogspot.com/2009/12/first-
impression-is-not-always-lasting.html), everyone seemed so quiet and reserved.
When he got up the nerve to talk to his fellow students, he had to overcome
other cultural barriers:

> I do not … mean to underestimate the difficulty for me as an African and in
> particular as an Ethiopian to give a proper picture of the place I call
> home. Many people seem to have a thick background reinforced with terrible
> images of war, famine and overall poverty…
>
> Personally, I do not feel rejected. Neither do I feel fully embraced. I
> still live with the situation where more often than not, people prefer to
> sit by people of their color type even when I am sitting alone.

The writers of _Mitmita_ got into the Christmas spirit “basking in the double
consciousness that is our Ethiopian hearts and western habits”. In [The
Mitmita Girls’ Naughty Or Nice List](http://www.mitmitaye.com/2009/12/mitmita-
girls-naughty-or-nice-list.html) they wrote:

> First comes the depravity of the European Christmas, followed by the more

Ethiopian orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7.

_Bernos_ writer Elle B, who described herself as a “black American”, shared
her experiences dating an Ethiopian man in the United States in the post
[Cross Section of Addis &
Georgia](http://www.bernos.org/blog/2010/01/12/cross-section-of-addis-
georgia/):

She soon discovered that racism was not just an issue of black vs. white:

In a multiple cultural crossover, _Don't Eat My Buchela(s)!_ showed what an
Ethiopian-American-Chinese-French Christmas looked like in [French Restaurant
Santa in
China](http://www.dalianmitmita.com/yblog/index.cfm/2009/12/22/French-
Resturant-Santa-in-China).

Arefe from the blog _I Was Just Thinking_ wrote about Ethiopian artist [Elias
Sime](http://arefe.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/eliass-art-fuse-with-oedipus-rex-
musical/) having his work chosen by an American director for use in an
Australian production of Oedipus Rex by Russian-born composer Igor Stravinsky.

Looking at crossovers from another direction, British economist Owen Barder
wrote about importing a cutting-edge piece of American culture into Addis
Ababa in the post [The Kindle in Ethiopia](http://www.owen.org/blog/2998):
