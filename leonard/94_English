More than 1,400 people were arrested by the police in today’s [Bersih
2.0](http://bersih.org/) rally which was organized to push for electoral
reforms in Malaysia. Police used tear gas to disperse a crowd which reached up
to 50,000 according to the organizers. Bersih means “clean” in the local
language.

Bersih was earlier declared
[illegal](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/01/malaysia-planned-rally-
calling-for-fair-elections-banned/) by the government but it was later given
an approval to hold the event inside a
[stadium](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/07/malaysia-online-reactions-
to-bersih-2-0-rally/); the venue administrator subsequently refused to issue a
permit for the event. The original plan of Bersih was to submit its [eight
demands](http://bersih.org/?page_id=4111) to the government.

The [Steering Committee](http://bersih.org/?p=4397) of the Bersih 2.0 or the
Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections issued this statement tonight:

> Bersih 2.0 is proud that in spite of all the obstacles and hindrances that
> we were forced to face, Malaysians of all walks of life overcame the
> oppressive acts of the police to come out peacefully and in incredibly large
> numbers to show their love for their country and for the principles of
> justice.
>
> We are nonetheless horrified that several hundred people have been detained,
> many of them without any justification whatsoever.
>
> Today’s gathering is not the end, it is but one more step in the long walk
> for clean and fair elections in Malaysia. The campaign continues, to work
> for electoral reform, the release of all detainees, and an end to harassment
> by the authorities.

The Bersih rally was the main topic in Malaysia’s social media networks,
particularly Twitter and Facebook. There were many hashtags used by twitter
users but
[#bersihstories](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&ands=&phrase=&ors=&nots=&tag=bersihstories&lang=en&from=&to=&ref=&near=kuala+lumpur&within=15&units=mi&since=&until=&rpp=20)
seems to be the preferred and most popular hashtag used today to document the
participation and observations of Bersih rallyists.
