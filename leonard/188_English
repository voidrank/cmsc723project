From the early days of the Egyptian revolution, protesters adopted their
ancestors way of documenting the glorious days, documenting the days of the
revolutions on the walls of Tahrir Square in central Cairo, the epicentre of
demonstrations. In turn, the [graffiti frenzy flourished across the walls of
Cairo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mshakour/tags/graffiti/).

In his blog _El Aam
Tonsy_[relates](http://tonsy.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/graffiti/) the
phenomenon to the Pharaohs’ drawings found on the walls of temples:

> كعادة المصري من قديم الأزل هي تسجيل الأحداث على الحائط

> Like the Pharaohs from a long tine ago, Egyptians are accustomed to document
> their events on walls

The rise of graffiti continued even after the regime stepped down. Artists
took it to a different level, and thought that murals could be a way to
commemorate the revolution's martyrs.

The noble initiative continued, to include tributes to different martyrs
across the districts of Egypt. Alas, one morning
[Ganzeer](http://ganzeer.blogspot.com/) woke up to find that one of the
[Martyr's murals has been
removed](http://ganzeer.tumblr.com/post/4892153360/mural-for-martyr-islam-

It has been said that the mural has been removed by government authorities.
However, the move was greatly disdained:

Ganzeer called for a quick reaction represented in Mad Graffiti Weekend
#madgraffitiweekend. The idea is dedicating a weekend (2 days) of hardcore
Graffiti across the city of Cairo to enforce the fact that Art as a free
expression that shouldn't be wiped out or eradicated.

He called for a [preliminary meeting on Friday
29th](http://ganzeer.blogspot.com/2011/04/first-mad-graffiti-meeting.html) to
gear up for the Mad Graffiti Weekend. The goals of the meeting are:

> 1- Ensuring that the streets of Egypt belong to the people of Egypt.  
>  2- Planning workable themes for Egyptian streets given the current
> circumstances.  
>  3- Planning locations.  
>  4- Creating work-groups

The invitation to take part has not been only extended to artists but also to
bloggers, and photographers as well as anyone who can help promote the fact
the those who claimed their country's freedom shouldn't be denied the right of
the freedom of expression.
