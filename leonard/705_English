Nigerian football fans were disappointed Tuesday when the team's final chance
of advancing in the 2010 World Cup evaporated in a 2-2 tie with South Korea.
At the start of the Cup, the future looked promising: Nigeria is one of the
highest-ranked African teams ([21st in FIFA's world
rankings](http://allafrica.com/stories/201005270530.html) — second only to
Egypt and Cameroon on the African continent); but the team has been burdened
with setbacks, including the installation of a new coach only three weeks
before the Cup and the red-carding of a star player.

For Nigeria fans, the Super Eagles’ recent performance has been vexing: The
team made an impressive World Cup debut in 1994, but soon after began to slip,
and have not won a Cup match since 1998. Many hoped that 2010 might be a
turning point, but Tuesday's result made clear that those watching for a
Nigerian football renaissance will have to wait until 2014 — if not longer.

In the blogosphere, disappointment was the prevailing emotion, though many
fans were not surprised by the outcome. _“They were never going to win that
game,”_ [wrote](http://nigeria.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/nigeria-nff-
ptf-fans-super-eagless-show-of-shame.html) _Bc Osunneye_ :

> Failed hotel bookings, broken down aircraft, failed friendlies, shifted

> Eagles coaches]_ for work done close to 5 years [ago] now are all just a few
> in the catalog of ineptitude.

_Adeola Aderounmu_ [pointed
to](http://aderinola.wordpress.com/2010/06/19/super-eagles-are-not-the-
problem/) corruption as one of the grounds for the team's poor performance:

> What are the criteria used for getting players into the national team? I
> have spoken to at least 2 ex-internationals and their responses are very
> heartbreaking. In some circumstances Nigerian politicians, dictators and
> family members have influenced the selection of players into the national
> team. There are stories (from the past) of bribing of coaches to get players
> selected into the team.

Others blamed [Sani Kaita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sani_Kaita) for the
team's failure. Kaita horrified fans by becoming the first Nigerian player to
be sent off the field during a World Cup match, after he received a red card
for attempting to kick a rival player. The red card was particularly rankling
as Nigeria had started the match promisingly: The score stood at 1-0 before
the incident. Team spokesman Peterside Idah said that Kaita [received more
than 1000 death
threats](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8750418.stm)
from fans in the wake of the Greece match.

_Nigerian Curiosity_ found humor in the incident and [coined a new
verb](http://www.nigeriancuriosity.com/2010/06/jokes-nigerias-kaita-
video.html):

> KAITA (Kai-ta)
>
> v. Kai*ta, Kai*tas, kai*ta'ed, kai*ta'ing
>
> 1\. To single-handedly dash the hopes and aspirations of one's nation in the
> full glare of other nations
>
> 2\. To karate-kick your way out of the greatest stage/spotlight ever known
> to man

> 3\. To destroy/zap/siphon the energies of teammates plus 140 million people

> 4\. To act foolishly, unintelligently or irrationally and IMMEDIATELY regret

> Oloshi!”
>
> 2\. “I don't care what people say, I will KAITA the multi-billion dollar
> plan!”

Fans also complained about the replacement of [Shaibu
Amodu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaibu_Amodu) with Swedish coach [Lars
Lagerbäck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Lagerb%C3%A4ck) just three weeks
before the Cup. Echoing [a _New York Times_
article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/sports/soccer/22coaches.html),
_Chxta_ [wondered](http://chxta.blogspot.com/2010/06/complexes.html) why Amodu
wasn't replaced with a qualified Nigerian coach:

> “Why do we have this terrible inferiority complex? … I say build from the
> bottom up… Let's gather the most intelligent of our ex-players – I suggest
> Siasia/Oliseh – and get them to mould a team that fits into the character of
> the nation.

_Max Siollun_ , present at the match with South Korea, [lamented the
annoyingness of Nigerian fans:](http://maxsiollun.wordpress.com/tag/girls/)

> Right behind me was a Nigerian with a smaller flag, who kept waving it and
> resting it on my head. I told him several times that my head was not a flag
> pole and to get it off me. Yet he persisted in wrapping the flag around my
> head continually. At one point, he had the temerity to get annoyed with ME
> for complaining about having a flag draped over my head from behind. He then
> proceeded to mutter insults about me to his friend in his native tongue.

Finding no silver lining in Nigeria's performance, _Bc Osunneye_ [took
comfort](http://nigeria.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/nigerias-world-cup-
moments.html) in posting photos from the team's glory days: _“Would we see
moments like this?”_ he asked.

Below the question he posted a video of his favorite moment in Nigerian
Football: Sunday Oliseh's winning goal against Spain in 1998.
