It would be an understatement to state that Indigenous community in North
America have not benefited equally from the industrial development of the
North American continent. Le [Centre de recherche sur la
mondialisation](http://www.mondialisation.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=5675)
(The Research Center on Globalization) made the following grim statement [fr]:

> l’espérance de vie est moindre, les maladies sont plus répandues, les
> problèmes humains, depuis la violence familiale jusqu’à l’alcoolisme, sont
> également plus répandus. Moins de jeunes achèvent leurs études secondaires,
> une minorité d’entre eux entrent au collège et à l’université

Life expectancy is lower, diseases are more widespread, the human challenges
ranging from domestic violence to alcoholism are also more widespread. Less
young people are finishing high school and only a few attend universities.

In fact, I made the argument in a
[blogpost](http://johanneveilleux.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/le-developpement-
international-et-les-autochtones-ca-se-passe-aussi-chez-nous/) [fr] that
international development should be a North America’s preoccupation when it
concerns indigenous people affairs. The relations between some governments
([Canada](http://www.canada.gc.ca/) and [Quebec](http://www.gouv.qc.ca) for
instance) and indigenous people of their territories, have many similarities
with relations between governments of the developed world and the most
vulnerable populations of the world. It is a much easier task to elaborate
programs filled with good intentions and sign international treaties when they
don’t impact us directly. However, when it comes to indigenous people and
poverty (indigenous people in Canada are ranked [63rd
](http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=764) on the [Human Development
Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index), while [Canada as
a whole is ranked
4th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)),
the question become a hot issue, since we are in theory sharing a territory,
as well as resources which could help indigenous people climb some echelons on
the Human Development Index.

Therefore, the [Innu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innu) community, indigenous
inhabitants of Labrador, Canada, have blocked access to a [Labrador Iron
Mines](http://www.labradorironmines.ca/) site since June 11. According to
[Mining Watch](http://www.miningwatch.ca/en/innu-moratorium), the Innu
community is:

> calling on the Government of Québec to declare an immediate moratorium on
> uranium exploration and mining throughout Québec (…) The Chief of the Innu
> of Uashat mak Mani-Utenam noted that several uranium exploration projects
> are found within their traditional territory and that all of these projects,
> as with all other authorisations by the Québec Government, require the free
> prior and informed consent of the Innu.

Representatives of the federal government, the Quebec government, the
Newfoundland and Labrador government and indigenous leaders from Schefferville
and Sept-Îles Maliotenam met to discuss economic opportunities that could come
out of the project. But a consensus is still to be reached: the Dany Williams
government of Newfoundland would like to get 80 % of the benefits associated
with the exploration activities of the newly opened mines, while Labrador Iron
Mines and New Millenium Capital offered 700 000$ of compensation to
Schefferville Innus to convince them to take off the barricades.  
This issue highlights the fact that some articles of the _Declaration on the
rights of indigenous peoples_ that __ the ___government of Quebec _supports,
are not always respected in reality. A clear example of this dissonance is
highlighted by blogger [Armand
McKenzie](http://armandmackenzie.blogspot.com/2010/08/lindustrie-miniere-et-
les-peuples.html) who cites the [article 32](http://daccess-
ods.un.org/TMP/1998274.02830124.html) of the Declaration, which states that:

> States shall provide effective mechanisms for just and fair redress for any
> such activities, and appropriate measures shall be taken to mitigate adverse
> environmental, economic, social, cultural or spiritual impact.

What’s more, according to _Melissa Filion_ , [who blogs for
Greenpeace](http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/fr/Blog/menaces-sur-le-pays-de-
la-terre-sans-arbre/blog/26199?sms_ss=facebook):

> Nothing has been done by the Quebec government, within the framework of the
> [Plan Nord](http://www.plannord.gouv.qc.ca), to resolve the issue related to
> rights and titles of First Nation. (…) Up to now, the government is clearly
