“We need to call Nimai to take a look at the wiring in the kitchen. Please go
and get him.” In the 90's that would be my mother asking my dad to go and
fetch the electrician from his house, so that he could come and inspect the
faulty wiring. There was no other way to contact Nimai.

Today, my electrician Barun has a dual-SIM mobile phone – he tells me that one
number is for his boss and the electrical shop which sub-contracts him and the
second is for his ‘personal clients’ that his company does not know about.
This second business is growing, he informs me with pride, and soon he will no
longer have to work for the electrical shop. His family, of course, can
contact him on either number.

Mobile technology and low-cost mobile telephony options have empowered service
providers like Barun to offer better services and enhance the reach of their
businesses. The story is similar everywhere, across the developing world. A
reader's comment on _Brough Turner's_ post [Mobile phone adoption goes crazy
in Pakistan](http://blogs.broughturner.com/2005/12/mobile_phone_ad.html)
reflected this reality way back in 2005:

However, the impact of the mobile phone is no longer restricted to
connectivity alone. It has grown into a tool that enables, farmers, small
traders and service providers to take information-based decisions, thereby
leading to their economic empowerment.

Thus, from the [fishermen in
Kerala](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125126978512659859.html?mod=googlenews_wsj)
tracking market prices and negotiating best deals for selling their catch the
next day, to [farmers in Andhra
Pradesh](http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/006200908112180.htm) using the
mobile phones as business helplines to gain useful business development
related information, small traders everywhere have woken up to the immense
potential of mobile technology in helping them better their lives. And in this
they are not alone. As Martine Koopman points out on her blog [ICT4D in Zambia
and Ghana](http://martinekoopman.blogspot.com/), the story is similar in
places like Ghana, for example. On a field trip to visit some farming
communities living about 6km from Salaga, she observes:

> _Now they have seen the advantages of phones all of them would like to have

> market traders visit the village they have a better negotiating position.
> They also have contact with market traders in Accra and Kumasi by phone._

Apart from imparting business/market information, the impact of the cell
phones can be felt when increasing cell phone usage helps to improve
distribution efficiency and reduction in search-of-information costs as well
as tackling price dispersions across local markets, as was seen [in this study
](http://www.cellular-news.com/story/29361.php)conducted in Niger.

In all of this, the end-consumer is also a beneficiary. We get the benefit of
convenience–from the basic facility of having an on-call service provider to
ordering the fresh catch of the day from the fish-monger on his mobile, right
up to using the [virtual marketplace](http://eyeline.mobi/asia/wsj-selling-
potatoes-by-phone/) on our cell phones to buy fresh produce directly from the
local farmer–in addition to enjoying competitively priced goods and products
and services in the long run.

“Nimai”, thundered my mother, “get yourself a mobile phone. Otherwise, next
time I am calling Barun.”
