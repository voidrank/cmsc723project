_[Syrian Revolution Map](http://www.syria15.com/)_ is a new
_[Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/)_ instance launched in Syria to track
ongoing protests in several cities based on citizen reports of protests,
security patrols, dangerous locations, clashes, and anticipated gatherings.
Six protesters have [reportedly been killed in
Daraa](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/18/syria-protests-across-the-
country-6-reported-killed-in-daraa/), and dozens have been arrested. The
website is in Arabic (some English and French) and allows people to send
reports using email, twitter, or a form. The site also enables users to sign
up for notifications of reports within 20 Km (12 miles) of any location.
