[Professor Yuji Ankei](http://ankei.jp/yuji_en/?n=1342) posted on Youtube a
rare version of the animated video called [Mr. Pluto, our reliable friend –
Story of plutonium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJlul0lTroY)
(頼れる仲間プルト君——プルトニウム物語). The video, that was later withdrawn, was made in the
1990s by the Japanese Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation
and “tries to convince younger generations that Plutonium is not so dangerous
as you imagine or many anti-nuclear activists insist.” Pinktentacle provided a
[detailed summary of the video](http://pinktentacle.com/2011/03/cute-pluto-
kun-cartoon-dispels-plutonium-fears/) in English.
