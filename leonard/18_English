A lot has been said about the liberating role technology has played in the
Middle East uprising, yet there is more to be said about the mutual role the
uprising is yet to play in liberating technology in the region.

This Wednesday, the official Facebook of the Egyptian prime minister
[published](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=451943038187168&set=a.403776479670491.81723.396874927027313)
a summary of one of his recent meetings. In it, the government agreed to
spending $43.8 million to acquire licenses and software products from
Microsoft. Many Egyptian citizens started to express their anger after reading
the news.

Nevertheless, the people were not angry because of the huge amount of money
being spent, but were mainly angry because they see better alternatives that
may cost less and also help develop the local software development community.

Things did not stop here, but members of the Open Source community in Egypt
[called for a silent demonstration in front of the cabinet of
ministers](https://www.facebook.com/events/368019856627453/) on the 30th of
December. Other demonstrations are also [being
arranged](https://www.facebook.com/events/306976486080465/) in different parts
of Egypt. And the hashtag
#[OpenEgypt](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openegypt&src=hash) is now being
used to introduce people to Open Source Software, and their benefits.
