The news of the plane crash in Western Russia, which killed the President
[Lech Kaczyński](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lech_Kaczy%C5%84ski), his wife
and dozens of other senior Polish officials this morning, is reaching the
entire blogosphere, as well as the [mainstream
media](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8612825.stm) now. The President
was traveling to [Katyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre), to take
part in commemoration of the anniversary of the 1940 Katyn Forest massacre.

Both Twitter and its Polish mirror service Blip.pl host initial reactions to
the catastrophe. People are shocked.
