Even before the Copenhagen Climate Change conference the Australian Opposition
parties had dumped their support for a Cap and Trade scheme and their leader
Malcolm Turnbull. Last week new Liberal party leader and global warming
sceptic Tony Abbott released an alternative [carbon emissions
plan](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opposition-leader-tony-abbott-unveils-
climate-change-policies/story-e6frf7jo-1225826106218).

Meanwhile Kevin Rudd’s government has reintroduced its Emissions Trading
Scheme to the House of Representatives where Turnbull crossed the floor to
vote against his own party. Last year the ETS was blocked twice by the Senate
after the Opposition dumped a negotiated deal. Turnbull argued that:

> This legislation is the only policy on offer which can credibly enable us to
> meet our commitment to a five per cent cut to emissions by 2020 and it also
> has the flexibility to enable us to move to higher cuts when they are
> warranted.

At _Club Troppo_ Ken parish is concerned that Turnbull is the only politician
effectively countering the sceptic and minimalist positions:

> Tony Abbott, who thinks man-made global warming is “crap”, nevertheless
> promises to spend billions of taxpayers’ dollars in dealing with it, even
> though his predecessor rightly labels the Mad Monk’s policy as “a recipe for
> fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” that would increase taxes and fail to
> reduce emissions.
>
> …Only Turnbull bothers to present a considered, analytical case for the ETS,
> but no-one listens because he’s yesterday’s man and neither policy nor
> principle nor even intelligent discussion are of the slightest interest to
> the reptiles of Australia’s political media.

The _Piping Strike_ is a regular commentator on Oz politics with several posts
this week. A key concern is how the ETS has been spun into a “new big tax”,
similar to the Goods and Services Tax controversy of the 1990s:

> Coalition politicians talking about the price of ice cream in supermarkets
> and Ministers rote-learning the prices of household goods makes it all seem
> as though we are having a re-run of the GST debate.

> … As Abbott keeps reminding Rudd, after Copenhagen things have changed.
> While it reaffirmed that nearly all the world’s governments now feel the

Leo Shanahan, staffer at _The Punch_ and perhaps one of Parish’s target media
reptiles, is preoccupied more with the messengers than the message:

Meanwhile at self-styled ‘libertarian and centre-right blog’ _Catallaxy files_
, Samuel J was unforgiving:

Veteran political journalist Mungo MacCallum did not spare Tony Abbott a lick
of his sarcasm at online journal _Crikey_ :

> To call Tony Abbott’s long-awaited policy on climate change an anti-climax
> is to heap it with undeserved praise.
>
> Indeed, to call it a policy at all is to overstate the reality: it is closer
> to something you might find scrawled on the back of a beer mat after a long
> night on the turps.

Ever the optimist, Mungo finds a bright side for future public debate:

> Still, even Abbott’s severest critics have to admit that there has been one
> useful spin-off already: Rudd has started to speak clearly about his own
> plan. His ETS has now been reduced from several pages of jargon and waffle
> to a simple grab: we put a cap on emissions; the polluters pay; and
> households get compensated for any price rises. Abbott’s policy does none of
> the above. End of story. Actually, of course, it’s rather more complicated
> and less ideal than that, but at least Rudd is now making it sound

Like global warming, it's a debate that is not likely to cool for some time.
Even the Federal election due by the end of the year is unlikely to bring the
parties together.
