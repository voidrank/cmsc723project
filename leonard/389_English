Despite a government ban, Iranians demonstrated in several cities today,
including Tehran (photo above), Shiraz, Isfahan, and Rasht. The Iranian
opposition had sought permission to demonstrate in solidarity with the
Egyptian and Tunisian people but the Islamic regime ignored the request.

According to [media
reports](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121412571299951.html#),
news has been circulating online of clashes between protesters and security
forces in Tehran, Iran's capital. According to these reports, thousands of
demonstrators marched on Enghelab and Azadi streets (which connect, creating a
straight path through the centre of the city), with a heavy presence in
Enghelab Square and Vali-Asr Street.

Videos of today's events have begun to appear online.
