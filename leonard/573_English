Although the November 7 elections in Myanmar has been criticized as a sham by
many countries around the world, the government is determined to push ahead
with it. As the day draws near, there are mixed reactions among the Burmese
people within the country and abroad.

The opposition party, National League of Democracy, has boycotted the election
citing that it is “unfair and undemocratic”, and is [urging the citizens not
to vote in the elections](http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=19745).
Detained Burmese pro-democracy leader, [Aung San Su Kyi, also decided that she
will not vote](http://irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=19713) in the
election even though she is on the electoral roll.

In Japan, the _2010 Election Boycott Committee_ has held [a protest
march](http://moeminthu.blogspot.com/2010/09/blog-post_19.html) in Ebitsu
Park, Tokyo.

In Rakhine State, “NO Campaign” posters were posted in several townships,
which read,  
“Boycott 2008 Constitution and 2010 Election: NO 2010″. One of the people who
participated in this campaign said to [Arakhan
Review](http://arakanreview.net/?p=2206):

> For Boycott Election Campaign, we have posted around 1000 posters in 12
> villages of Taung Kote and Ma Ei Townships one month before the Nov 7
> election. We have gone down to these villages so that everyone in these
> villages can participate in this campaign against the government's election.
> We have to do this campaign together in both townships of Taung Kote and Ma
> Ei because these two townships together make up one constituency. Another
> thing is Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP) and National Unity Party
> (NUP) will be the only two parties running in this constituency, so we don't
> need to feel bad towards other parties by this boycotting. We totally
> opposed the 2008 Constitution, so we cannot accept this 2010 Elections which
> will legalize this constitution.
