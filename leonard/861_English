A month after a seven-point earthquake destroyed much of southern Haiti, the
fate of children, and particularly
[orphans](http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/01/2010121181833279445.html),
has become the [main
story](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/world/jan-
june10/haiti_02-09.html) in
[many](http://www.france24.com/en/20100210-2010-haiti-earthquake-orphans-
restavecs-restaveks-labor-slavery-adoption)
[corners](http://www.mides.gub.uy/mides/colgado.jsp?contentid=6401&site=1&channel=inju).
But Haitian voices on the topic have been few.

In this long video report posted at[
Telegraph21](http://www.telegraph21.com/), recorded in the days immediately
following the quake, managers of two Haitian orphanages speak to the issue in
two drastically different ways. At minute 2:30, the manager of an orphanage in
an unnamed location in Haiti expresses frustration at the sudden interest in
Haitian children, where before there was less concern. Inquiries from foreign
families seeking to adopt have become daily. “I don't even reply,” she says.
“Everybody listen, I don't want to receive post-catastrophe requests.”

A counterpart identified as Ledice, however, who cares for sixty children in a
different facility, calls for relocating kids faster, and cites a lack of
government services to approve adoptions, even those underway before the
disaster. “Now it's a humanitarian cause,” she says. “Let's take the kids.
We'll see the papers later.”

``

Much of the recent focus on kids, both mainstream and not, comes from the
[widely-publicized
case](http://www.hiphopmusic.com/best_of_youtube/2010/02/haitian_child_believed_she_was_going_on_brief_vacation_news.html)
of an American church group arrested last week while trying to bring thirty-
three kids from Haiti to the Dominican Republic. But a broader debate is also
underway.

[debates international
adoption](http://www.conducivemag.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=81:international-
adoption-and-the-fight-for-human-rights&catid=37:critical-thinking&Itemid=62),
notes that previous rushes to adopt children out of crisis went awry:

> Removing children during times of disaster is not new. We saw this with
> Operation Babylift after the Vietnam War, where the American government
> hurriedly removed almost 3,000 children from their homeland during the Fall
> of Saigon in 1975. Lawsuits between birth parents and adopted parents tied
> up U.S. courts for years. Birth parents claimed they never consented to the
> adoption, and adoptive parents claimed the adoption was legitimate. Critical
> adoption theorists are seeing parallels with the current rushed adoption of
> Haitian children.

In a post titled [Orphans, Orphans,
Orphans!](http://resistracism.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/orphans-orphans-
orphans/), ResistRacism is more specific:

> How many prospective adoptive parents have been trained in cross cultural

The same post suggests a more creative solution.

Renewed attention to Haiti's Restavec (sometimes Restavek) system has also
become an issue. In a
[post](http://repeatingislands.com/2009/06/11/haiti%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Crestavek%E2%80%9D-system-
tantamount-to-slavery/) from before the quake, [Repeating
Islands](http://repeatingislands.com/) says the system, “through which parents
unable to support their children send them to live with more affluent
relatives or strangers for whom they receive food, shelter and education in
return for work” has become tantamount to slavery. She quotes a United Nations
investigator who visited Haiti last year to investigate the Restivek issue,
saying

> …Although placement with children with other family members has long been a
> practice in Haiti, nowadays ‘paid recruiters scour the country looking for
> children to traffic both within and outside Haiti. This practice is a severe
> violation of the most fundamental rights of the child.’

Most international agencies involved in crisis childcare have, in the past two
weeks, stated opposition to rapid adoptions in Haiti. The International
Committee of the Red Cross, in a statement presented as an
[interview](http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/haiti-earthquake-
interview-020210) with one of its child protection officers, said it believed
efforts to connect children with family members in Haiti should receive
priority, and adoption a last resort.

> …In situations where a child is evacuated, there are clear procedures to
> follow: the child should be accompanied by a relative or someone who knows
> them, if possible; the details of the child must be registered and their
> family must know where the child is taken to and by whom. Unfortunately some
> children were evacuated in haste without all their details being recorded.

Aid groups including Save the Children, World Vision and the Red Cross
Disaster Fund (which is separate from the International Committee), issued[ a
joint statement](http://www.worldvision.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.3470) also
opposing evacuations and adoptions. So did
[UNICEF](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_52519.html).

So what's the controversy? The case of the children stopped at the border
involved a Protestant church adoption group, some of which have
[advocated](http://www.baptiststandard.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10728&Itemid=53)
international adoption as a [means of spreading their own religious
views](http://www.christian-alliance-for-orphans.org/aboutus/vision.asp).
Other evangelist Christian blogs are more careful. [Christianity
Today](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2010/februaryweb-
only/16-32.0.html), “A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction” opposed quick
international adoptions:

> In the initial months after an incident like this, we don't want to move
> children away from the area where family members are searching for them.
> After the Southeast Asian tsunami in 2004, there were many small kids
> virtually unidentifiable, and yet a very high percentage of those children,
> thanks to DNA testing and other methods, were eventually returned to family
> members.
