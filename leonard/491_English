For those living in a particular country, many things can sometimes be taken
for granted. But when others from outside discover it for the first time,
often experiencing new colors and traditions, a fresh insight is often the
result.

In an extended blog post, for example, _Meaning Full_ details its experience
of Azerbaijan, the oil-rich former Soviet republic in the South Caucasus, and
touches upon many aspects of life from culture and identity to thoughts on
Islam and gender. The Portuguese blogger says that at times she [felt as if in
a fairy tale](http://blog.humaneasy.com/paula/draft-impressions-from-
azerbaijan/).

> Men, men, men everywhere. Few women on the streets, few women doing things,

Nevertheless, the blogger also admits to having some concerns regarding safety
before her arrival, but says that they disappeared once on the ground.
Although identifying some of the problems typical for a patriarchal and
moderately Islamic country, she was [fascinated by the vibrant rays of the
capital Baku and its residents.](http://blog.humaneasy.com/paula/draft-
impressions-from-azerbaijan/)

> When coming to the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, I had no idea of how it

> or not. My worries vanished, when my colleague Farida kindly offered to a
> guided tour. I had the opportunity to see the pleasure of the walking zones

> night so many people walking by the long water front of the calm Caspian
> Sea. […] I felt the beat of a city that moves and breaths collectively,
> where people truly enjoy their own city.

Many foreigners in the country do, however, often raise the issue of gender
roles. Relaying an experience with the matriarch of the family she live with,
and affectionately calling her ‘mom,’ _Making Wool from Eggs_ , the blog of a
Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV) in Azerbaijan, [notes the expections society has
of its women.](http://morganstuart2010.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/cooking-and-
marriage/)

> […] The week before Thanksgiving I decided to make a preliminary pie for my
> family. […] When we got to my house, I start making the dough, and Alise
> starts peeling the apples. My mom watched us intently and was very impressed
> with my abilities to make and roll out dough. She was so impressed in fact,
> that she remarked “You can do something!” […] She told me that I was “ready
> for marriage.” Here, when a woman learns to cook, she is ready to marry and
> cook for her husband However, my friend Alise is not ready for marriage. My
> mom does not like the way she peels apples. […]

Even so, foreigners in the country are also taken with how refreshingly simple
life in Azerbaijan can appear _Dream it, Plan it and Do it!_ , another PCV
blog, for example, [shares its thoughts on the lifestyle compared to back home
in the U.S.](http://tiffanycmc.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-life-in-azerbaijan-
living-in-dream.html).

> Every day, I have time to read, to write, to work, to cook breakfast, lunch
> and dinner. I have time for my daily exercise, to shop in the bazaar and I
> even have time to bake a cake. My working hour at the bank is from 9:30am to

> Perhaps I am in fact living in a dream. […]

On a similar note, on _From the Land of Fire_ blog, a former PCV also recalls
good memories of living in Azerbaijan for more than 3 years and that this time
spent has [reshaped her priorities in a
life](http://raechellewatkins.blogspot.com/2010/12/homesick-for-

True, life in a country such as Azerbaijan for a foreigner can be more
privileged than for most locals who still lead difficult lives in other ways,
but they also offer a colorful image of life which is sometimes taken for
granted and forgotten by many during an often painful period of transition.
