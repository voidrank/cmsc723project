A planned [hotel development](http://www.freedombaysaintlucia.com/the-
resort/a-world-class-location) near [the
Pitons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitons) in Saint Lucia has fueled more
debate about the way to balance development with cultural and environmental
concerns. The proposed “eco-luxury” development is “Freedom Bay”, which plans
to include a five-star hotel in addition to private residences.

Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott has been a vocal critic of untrammeled
development, particularly in this sensitive area, which has been designated a
[UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1161). He
[addressed this latest
issue](http://caribbeanbookblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/derek-walcott-i-am-
ashaamed-of-my-country/) while speaking to reporters at the launch of Nobel
Laureate Week:

> ‘Where is this hotel going to be located?’ Walcott demanded. ‘Have they
> begun it yet? When are they starting? And exactly where is this place? Will
> you see it in any projection of Petit Piton? And nobody has objected to it?
> They have not objected to it in parliament? So the deal was approved by the
> Saint Lucian government. I am ashamed of my country because that’s whoring
> and you can quote me on that. If you are telling me right, that there is
> going to be a hotel built at the base of Petit Piton, visible as a hotel,
> then that is whoring and I am ashamed of my country. There can still be time
> for protest but what can you say when a country approves of its own
> disfigurement?’

seemed to be the hub for online discussion about the issue. [Leigh Allan
wasn't
sure](http://www.facebook.com/groups/282803341756900/permalink/472354376135128/?comment_id=472849332752299&offset=0&total_comments=24)
about the extent to which hotel developments are worth it in the long term:

> This is going to bring some jobs and that's great! St.Lucia can really do
> with more employment opportunities. I'm just curious as to how many of those
> jobs will be blue collar or white collar? Also on the topic of hotels have
> we sorted out the issues with some hotels not paying taxes for many years
> without consequences or are they using their employees jobs to not pay taxes
> owed to government. We also need to think about when if ever a government in

> of St.Lucia and not the hotels?

Christopher Simmons suggested that the project is [a land grab by speculators
and not a major
development](http://www.facebook.com/groups/282803341756900/permalink/472354376135128/?comment_id=473500892687143&offset=0&total_comments=24):

> Plain and simple. We have just handed over to foreign white speculators one
> of the most lucrative piece (sic) of real estate in the world. This project
> is no more than a luxury condo development and not a world established
> resort hotel. Therefore the positive impact on the economy will be minimum.
> I can tell you that that pierce (sic) of real estate will change hands and
> be sold for million (sic) more during the next 10 years. 6 senses are not
> hotel developers or investors, they are a hotel management company operating
> a few average resorts in the Indian Ocean…Due to transparency let the people
> of St.Lucia know what was paid for the property and the terms of contract,
> concessions etc. What use the poor excuses of Jobs?

Nadia Causabon was concerned about the loss of the nation's patrimony and
[proposed that the development be moved to a less sensitive
area](http://www.facebook.com/groups/282803341756900/permalink/472354376135128/?comment_id=473526686017897&offset=0&total_comments=24):

> How much of our culture will we lose by losing access to that beach? You
> should demand to find out what kind of access you will have on that beach
> once construction starts. If you have never used that beach I hope you
> didn't just have an ‘its not in my backyard so it doesn't affect me’
> thought! How much of our heritage will we lose? How much of our patrimony
> have we lost? Can we get it back?  
> What can you do? I urge you to write to planning, ministers and the

> What I would like to see is for this development to relocate to another area

Dr. Jimmy Fletcher, Minister for Sustainable Development, Energy, Science and
Technology Government, confirmed that[ the Freedom Bay development is within
the Heritage
Site](http://www.facebook.com/groups/282803341756900/permalink/472354376135128/?comment_id=473938182643414&offset=0&total_comments=24):

> The Freedom Bay Development falls within the Pitons Management Area. I
> believe what the Permanent Secretary said is that it falls within Policy
> Area 4 of the PMA. The Hyder Report or the Pitons Management Area and
> Soufriere Region Integrated Development Plan (November 2007) establishes 7
> Policy Areas and prescribes the levels of development that should take place
> in each of these areas.

Fletcher then indicated what types of development were allowed in the area:

> Both these areas allow for trails and minor interpretation works. Policy
> Area 3 is the coastal area (Jalousie and Beausejour) and there are 3
> different scenarios possible: (i) a restrained approach that calls for no
> new buildings or infrastructure. However, building refurbishment and minor
> leisure developments in hotel complex are allowed; (ii) a balanced or
> intermediate approach that allows leisure and residential developments in
> selected locations subject to EIA; and (iii) a Permissive Approach that
> allows leisure and residential developments subject to EIA. Policy Area 4
> comprises the Remainder of the PMA, which is where the Freedom Bay project
> will be located.

He went on to say that ultimately any development is subject to an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):

> The Restrained Approach for this Area allows for built development and
> infrastructure only for limited community, residential and agricultural
> needs and minor leisure and tourism development and the processing of local
> agricultural produce. The balanced or intermediate approach for Policy Area
> 4 allows, in addition to the concessions for the Restrained Approach,
> development in or adjacent to existing villages or in plantations, e.g.
> plantation hotels, subject to EIA. The Permissive Approach for Policy Area 4
> allows development in new locations subject to EIA.

Dane Gibson reiterated the point that [not all developments are worth the
cost](http://www.facebook.com/groups/lucianmovement/permalink/514084401975699/)
and linked to this [2010 profile from the Telegraph newspaper in support of
his point](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p56Bl5BxFRY):

> While I acknowledge there is almost a certain desperation on the part of
> government and some of our people to improve and maintain economically the
> lively hoods of St Lucians we must be very careful that it should not come
> at the cost of selling our Natural Heritage for thirty pieces of silver

Gibson joined Nadia Causabon in suggesting that the development be moved to
another location on the island:

> The proposed concept and model is being offered by Sixth Senses and Freedom
> Bay can be done on a Conway site if done correctly. Let them build, let them
> build and responsibly, but let them build somewhere else on the island and
> preserve our Natural Heritage and Legacy.

Amatus Edwards, in reply to Gibson,
[added](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lucianmovement/permalink/514084401975699/):

> It is my view that lands of commercial and agriculture nature that is own
> (sic)by government should never be sold – only leased. Government should
> also move in and seek to acquire properties like this one and do a better
> job at sustain-ably managing it that (sic) this aging man.
