frustrations-from-the-overlooked/chibaibaraki/)While the eyes of the media and
the rest of Japan have been glued to developments in the Tohoku region, cries
for help from other disaster areas have not received as much attention. The
coasts of northeastern Kanto were hit hard by the massive earthquake and
subsequent tsunami. [Ibaraki
Prefecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibaraki_Prefecture), where the
tsunami swallowed up several of its coastal towns, has had [19 earthquake
related
casualties](http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0315/TKY201103150082.html).
The [Kashima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashima,_Ibaraki) industrial
complex, one of the largest industrial areas in Japan, was severely affected.
[16 deaths](http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0315/TKY201103150082.html)
have been confirmed in [Chiba
Prefecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiba_Prefecture), 11 of which were
tsunami victims in the northeastern coast, and 7 people are still missing.
[11,332 people in Ibaraki and 806 people in
Chiba](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20110315/t10014697251000.html) are
taking shelter in evacuation centers.

On Twitter, many people are starting to express their frustration about the
lack of coverage and information from these areas.

> 【お願い】茨城・千葉・栃木・長野・新潟の状況が全然入ってきていません。被害状況・安否情報・避難所・給水所・物資支援状況等もっと報道して下さい！視聴率稼ぎの報道ではなく、伝えるべきことを伝えて下さい。本当にお願いします。#nhk
> #ntv #tvasahi #tbs #fujitv

We are lacking information about Ibaraki/Chiba/Tochigi/Nagano/Niigata. Please
report more about the damage situation, safety information, the evacuation
centers, supply support and so on. Please don’t just report what will get you
higher ratings, report what needs to be known. Please.

> 津波、原発も大事です。でもほとんど報道されてない被災地域もあるんだよ。茨城の状況とか千葉の断水とか全然聞かないのはどうして？

The tsunami and nuclear power plants are both important. But there are also
the devastated areas, which have hardly received any coverage. Why don’t we
hear anything about conditions in Ibaraki Prefecture and about the water
stoppage in Chiba?

> 千葉、茨城は被災地なのに、東北程に目を向けられてない。メディアもドキュメントだったり
> 助かったやったー的な報道、それからどの局も原発。それよりも現地の炊き出しの状況や空いてる避難所などの情報を流すべきなんじゃないだろうか。でも今のこの状況で、どうやったらこの意見は届く…？

Chiba and Ibaraki are both disaster zones but they’re not being given the same
level of attention as Tohoku. The media are showing on-site footage & rescues,
and every station is featuring the nuclear power plants. Shouldn’t they be
broadcasting information about the state of soup kitchens and about which
shelters are open? With things in the state they are, how can I tell them
this?

Some also raised their concerns about the blackout planned for March 14, which
would affect the disaster-hit areas.

Please remove Ibaraki from rolling blackouts. It is a quake-hit area. The
northern part of Ibaraki in particular is still in a critical situation, with
power/water outages and supply shortages. Please pass this on ASAP.

> 東京電力さん。銚子、旭市は被災地です。ライフイン全滅の地区もあります。停電する地域を考えて下さい。NHKさんも報道お願い致します。#nhk

Dear TEPCO, Choshi and Asahi are disaster-hit areas. Some districts don’t have
lifelines working. Think before you choose blackout areas. NHK, you too,
please cover this.

Minami-Sanriku town, where people are stuck and still unable to flee, is the
place I call home. I know this is selfish but I desperately want them to
prioritise the area and rescue them. But I would never say ignore Tochigi and
Ibaraki. These areas should be removed from the plan of rolling blackouts.
Better blackout the Tokyo’s 23 wards for 30 min each than blackout the quake-
hit areas.

As the major source of electricity for the [Kanto
region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region) was lost in the
earthquake and the production of electricity significantly decreased, [Tokyo
Electric Power Company
(TEPCO)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company) announced
that rolling blackouts would be implemented in the Kanto and surrounding
region in order to suppress electricity supply.  
After [much confusion](http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20110314dy04.htm),
at 17:00 on March 14, electricity was cut off in selected areas. TEPCO
[initially announced that the power outage would be carried out only in parts
of Ibaraki and
Shizuoka](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCDn1wXRdsBk6uhW1bxQktIGPYOQ?docId=CNG.5f260e64e119410610fba84308cdfd97.451).
But in fact, other areas in the Kanto regions, including those hit by the
earthquake and tsunami, such as
[Asahi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi,_Chiba), where 11 people died and a
few are still missing, were also included.

> 今、旭市の親戚宅。17時ちょうどから停電始まってます。 被災地なのに電気止められちゃうの？って感じ。 水道も復旧してないのに･･･(´･ω･｀)

At my relative’s in Asahi now. Blackout started at 17:00 sharp. I’m like,
disaster area gets power cut off? Water hasn’t even been restored yet…

> [@reyrey551](http://twitter.com/#!/reyrey551/status/47212878595506176)
> NHKだと茨城と静岡の一部って言ってたが今千葉テレビ見ると香取市は停電で旭市と銚子市も停電みたいだが

NHK said only in parts of Ibaraki and Shizuoka, but according to Chiba TV it
seems that there is a blackout in Katori, as well as in Asahi and Choshi.

> [@kabu_frog kabu](http://twitter.com/#!/kabu_frog/status/47221110676271105)
> 茨城県鹿嶋で停電してる！潮来市も神栖市もだ！ここは報道されてないけど被害結構あったから止めてくれ！

Power is out in Kashima, Ibaraki! And in Itako and Kamisu too! There’s not
much media coverage of these areas but there has been a lot of damage, so
please stop doing this!

> [@no9_halu](http://twitter.com/#!/no9_halu/status/47225758195789824)
> 【公式RT希望】都心を停電させないために、津波の被災地であり未だ余震の続く茨城県や千葉県の沿岸地域（鹿嶋や銚子など）が計画停電中。何か矛盾していませんか？

In order to avoid a power outage in the center of the capital, a planned
blackout is being carried out in the coastal areas of Ibaraki and Chiba
(including Kashima and Choshi), areas hit by the tsunami and where there are
still aftershocks. Don’t you see a contradiction here?

TEPCO later officially
[apologized](http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/tokyo-power-
outages-to-start-later-than-planned-trains-reduce-services) for including
disaster centers in the blackout areas, stating that it [had not taken into
consideration the disaster
situation](http://www.asahi.com/special/10005/TKY201103140446.html). Another
rolling power outage was implemented on March 15, but [the disaster areas were
excluded this
time](http://sankei.jp.msn.com/region/news/110315/chb11031514570002-n1.htm).
