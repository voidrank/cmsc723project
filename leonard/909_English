In June of 2009, [Global Voices
Advocacy](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/20/mauritania-
webmaster-of-taqadoumycom-arrested/) was the first to report that Mauritanian
editor Hanevy Ould Dahah, who runs leftist site
[_Taqadoumy_](http://www.taqadoumy.com), had been arrested over a comment left
on the site. Ould Dahah, sentenced to 6 months in prison, should have been
released on December 24, however, on December 26 it was
[reported](http://dekhnstan.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/my-first-post-hanevy-
ould-dahah/) by blogger Nasser Weddady on _Dekhnstan_ , that Ould Dahah was
still being held. In the blog's very first post, Weddady remarked:

> This is why I decided blogging. Hanevy’s case is not just another
> blogger/journalist thrown away for political reasons. His is one that will
> have profound implications for the country: if General Aziz doesn’t feel any
> push back for his treatment of a journalist, he is certainly going to assume
> that he is free to repress any dissenting voice without fear of any
> consequences. Let’s say that this is THE test case for the future of civil
> rights in the tiny, often forgotten, nation of Mauritania.

On the 28th, Weddady
[reported](http://dekhnstan.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/hanevy-starts-a-hunger-
strike/) that Ould Dahah had begun a hunger strike. On January 5, the
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)
[condemned](http://cpj.org/2010/01/prison-term-completed-mauritanian-editor-
still-jai.php) the Mauritanian authorities for holding Ould Dahah past his
release date, and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI)
[called on](http://www.anhri.net//en/reports/2010/pr0104.shtml) the
Mauritanian government to respect the law. To date, no mainstream media
sources have reported on the case.

To date, Ould Dahah is still being held. On January 14, Nasser Weddady of
_Dekhnstan_ [posted](http://dekhnstan.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/when-the-magic-
turns-on-the-magician/):

> Hanevy Ould Dahah should _in theory_ have his day at the supreme court today
> (Jan 14) after being suddenly summoned to appear before the highest court in
> the land. Except that the proceeding will be illegal. Make no mistake, the
> Mauritanian government did not suddenly discover that it erred in this case,
> it is merely trying to coverup its already highly illegal treatment of
> Hanevy. In fact, the authorities may convict him to another sentence!

Weddady also named the officials involved in Ould Dahah's detention, but then
stated, “Hanevy’s ordeal is sanctioned by the highest authorities in
Mauritania: General Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz. The system Mauritanians live under
is such that he, and he alone, has the power of life and death on anyone
foolish enough to cross him.”
