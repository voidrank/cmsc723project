Despite the strict laws against littering in Singapore, the number of
offenders still went up in recent years prompting the Singapore government to
intensify its [anti-litter
campaign](http://wildsingaporenews.blogspot.com/2010/06/singapores-worst-
litterbugs.html). A more aggressive [shame
campaign](http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/3803-spore-hopes-
shaming-litterbugs-will-help-keep-squeaky-clean-image) will be implemented and
“litter-free Ambassadors” will be recruited.

Tan Kin Lian believes Singapore should revert to being a [“fine”
society](http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2010/06/fine-society.html)

> Singapore used to be a “fine” society. There is a fine for littering and for
> jay-walking. This has been relaxed for the past one or two decades.
>
> The environmental agency is now taking action to enforce littering. It is
> time to take action to enforce other aspects of our law, such as jay-walking
> and cheating. We need to revert back to our fine and orderly society.

Rex is surprised that the government will spend [12 million
dollars](http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2010/06/fine-
society.html?showComment=1275870517336#c9091378419155707974) for the anti-
litter campaign

> I was so surprised today to read that the government will spent TWELVE
> MILLION DOLLARS on the campaign to enforce no-littering habits. TWELVE
> MILLION DOLLARS. Oh my god. The already filthy rich newspaper, topnotch
> media companies, are no doubt the main beneficiaries, carrying full page
> advertisements, creating commercial clips run on prime time TV

[Chee Ming](http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2010/06/fine-
society.html?showComment=1275885118753#c274230740728481980) writes that
foreign workers, which comprise 20 percent of Singapore’s population, should
be reminded as well about the campaign

> It's strange that we have to enforce law to deter littering when we have
> litter bin all around Singapore. In fact, I suspect Singapore is the country
> that has the highest proportion of rubbish bin to population.
>
> Since we were well-educated from young not to litter, I think the fine
> imposed on littering is targeted at Singaporeans who are less well-learned,
> or well-taught, or both. Oh, and don't forget the 20% of the population whom
> we called “foreign workers”.

[Uncle Sha](http://www.sha.tc/singapore/littering) wonders why the litter
issue is treated by the media as a headline news story

> For me personally the topic at-hand does not have any merit to be bumped as
> top headline.
>
> How about local issues such as disparity in high and low income earners, the
> growing number of homeless in Singapore, and such.
>
> I know that the NEA is trying to drum up the message of us not to litter in
> public, but I felt the majority of such litterbugs are actually our new
> Foreign Talent and Foreign Workers.

_Trial of tears_ suggests some measures to [humiliate the
litterbugs](http://zenmindsword.posterous.com/littering-in-singapore)

> a) …publish the address of litterers and legally allow the public to litter
> the litterer's home for a week.
>
> b) Don't just fine litterers. Instead make them wear a huge board around
> their necks and stand at busy areas proclaiming their anti-social act. Also
> publish their identities on Facebook for everyone to see.
>
> c) I personally like this one. Make them work in an incineration plant or
> food recycling plant for a week doing tasks that exposes them to the stench
> of rubbish. Let's see how they like the smell of what cleaners are exposed
> to. Better still send them to work in a plant that recycles human waste.
>
> d) Make litterers bear the cost of cleaning up the area they litter for one
> year. Yes, littering is not free. There is an actual monetary cost involved.

The anti-litter campaign has generated a debate on whether [foreign
workers](http://migrantworkerssingapore.blogspot.com/2010/06/foreigners-do-so-
in-areas-that-feel.html) should be blamed for the pollution problem in
Singapore. The discussion became more intense after the [freak
flood](http://singapore-lighthouse.blogspot.com/2010/06/freak-flood-again-now-
at-orchard-road.html) in Singapore last week with some netizens blaming
foreign workers for the trash accumulation in the city. Meanwhile, foreign
workers are
[reminding](http://singaporeitentrepreneur.blogspot.com/2010/01/litterbug-
issue-dont-you-think-its-your.html) Singaporeans that the locals should not
blame the influx of foreigners as the only reason why littering is getting
worse.
