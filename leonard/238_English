In the wake of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake which hit Japan, changing forever
the lives of so many people, popular writer [Keiya
Mizuno](http://www.mizunokeiya.com/) (水野敬也) decided to use words as a means to
react to the event and reflect on the meaning of life.  
In a post titled [The Fear of Magnitude 0

[personal blog](http://ameblo.jp/mizunokeiya/), the author of ironic books
such as _Yume wo Kanaeru Zoh_ highlights the importance of memory and the
value of remembering lessons learnt from such tragedies even after these may
have, for some, tended to sink back into oblivion.
