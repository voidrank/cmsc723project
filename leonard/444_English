In most recent emergencies, the new media proved to be a significant source of
first-hand information. Although the Domodedovo bombing wasn't much different
in this regard, the role of new media here was corroded by sophisticated
manipulations.

**Frustration with mass media coverage**

Russian media reports on an attack in Moscow metro in 2010 and recent blast in
Domodedovo International Airport raised a question if Russian traditional
media are capable to provide adequate coverage of this type of events. In
March 2010, bloggers already [expressed their
outrage](http://www.gzt.ru/topnews/accidents/-na-terakty-v-metro-telekanaly-
otreagirovali-/298777.html) [RUS] about the fact that most TV channels didn't
stop entertainment programs with breaking news broadcasting. The same scenario
repeated in Domodedovo.

Blogger _Netdogg_ [wrote](http://netdogg.livejournal.com/310563.html) [RUS]
that the quality journalism in Russia was eliminated and replaced by relaxing
PR. Famous blogger Alexey Navalny
[suggested](http://navalny.livejournal.com/545352.html) [RUS] that the event
symbolized the end of traditional media:

> Прямо сейчас мы наблюдаем окончательную смерть телевидения и традиционных
> СМИ как источника оперативной информации в кризисной ситуации.
> Информационные агентства, радио и тот же телек. Все цитируют сообщения из
> твиттера. Первый раз я об этом подумал, когда там транслировались “события
> на Манежной”, сейчас это стало очевидно. Первые полтора часа есть только
> твиттер.

Right now we are witnessing the final death of TV and traditional media as a
source of first-hand information in emergency situation. Information agencies,
radio and TV – they are all quoting information from Twitter. The first time
when I though about it was during the “events on Manezhnaya square,” but now
it's obvious. The first hour and a half there is only Twitter.

As [described by Alexey Sidorenko](../2011/01/24/russia-first-twitter-reports-
of-domodedovo-suicide-bombing/), Twitter and other social media platforms
provided a lot of first-hand information, photos and videos that were re-
published and broadcast later by traditional media. Blogger _Rokoto_
[conducted](http://rokoto.livejournal.com/62563.html) [RUS] detailed analysis
of media coverage of the Domodedovo attack and argued that with Twitter one
could get information as fast as president. “Slon” news portal made
comparative analysis and [wrote](http://slon.ru/articles/524254/) [RUS] that
“TV channels totally lost the first hour and a half when people found
information, photo and video on the Internet.”

But the role of social media should be evaluated not only in terms of their
impact on traditional media, but also its influenced on the content of the
coverage.

**The case of taxi drivers**

One of the major stories circulated on social media was an allegation that
taxi drivers [raised
prices](http://twitter.com/#%21/Xyligunka/status/29557080918593536) [RUS] for
a ride from the airport to Moscow. The information triggered not only angry
reaction in the blogosphere, but also an active bloggers’ response. Hashtags
#dmdhelp and #freetaxi were set up to organize help with transport and list of
phone numbers of social media users who are ready to give a free ride to
passengers were distributed online.

The first disproofs of this rumor
[appeared](http://twitter.com/hashenko73/status/29578862081867776) within the
first minutes but were silenced by the bloggers’ rage towards taxi drivers.

Few hours later, popular blogger Rustem Adagamov ( _drugoi_ ) [published under
a title “Civic solidarity”](http://drugoi.livejournal.com/3470693.html) [RUS]
a Reuters’ photo of three young ladies standing at the airport with hand-
written signs: “Free ride to metro.” But Bloggers stated that the women were
activists of the infamous Kremlin youth movement “Nashi.” Another well-known
blogger Anton Nossik [claimed](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/1970903.html)
[RUS] that the assistance to passengers was another PR action of the activists
who [already tried to use emergency situations for political
purposes](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/08/russia-bloggers-clash-
with-the-ruling-party/). Adagamov
[responded](http://twitter.com/#%21/adagamov/status/29634470323683329) [RUS]
by saying that any collective action made by a political group in Russia is
labeled as a window dressing and people miss the fact that actual assistance
from any person or a group is valuable. Others
[mentioned](http://twitter.com/kozlovsky/status/29657086937792514) [RUS] that
“Nashi” were not the only ones to offer help.

And still, the situation with the taxi drivers wasn't clear. One of the
drivers who published his phone online and went to Domodedovo
[wrote](http://twitter.com/otonosan/status/29625181852925952) [RUS] that the
only calls that he received were either from journalists or contained threats.
Ilya Varlamov went to Domodedovo and
[testified](http://zyalt.livejournal.com/348236.html) [RUS] that the highest
price was not more than usual $100. Besides, he reported, “almost immediately,
‘Aeroexpress’ ( _the train from Domodedovo to Moscow – G.V._ ) offered a free
ride to passengers.”

Ilya Barabanov, deputy editor of liberal magazine “The New Times”
[suggested](http://twitter.com/barabanch/status/29651843575451648) [RUS] that
“the taxi drivers’ case” was a plain political
[manipulation](http://twitter.com/barabanch/status/29656091872727041)[RUS] :

> Идея: перевести гнев с ментов и чекистов, которые прососали теракт, на
> таксистов – могла сработать. И твитили нашисты, политонлайны

The idea: transfer the anger from police and security agencies that failed to
stop the terrorist attack to the anger toward taxi drivers – it could work.
And those who twitted ( _information about the increased prices – G.V.)_ were
“Nashi” activists and Politonliners ( _propagandist social media aggregator –
G.V._ ).

Barabanov acknowledged that he was not able to find any significant first-hand
evidence to his claim. He
[explained](http://twitter.com/barabanch/status/29674385883271169) [RUS] why
the manipulation could be done easily, or one particular case could grow out
of its proportion:

> Журналисты-информационщики сегодня брали по максимуму и оперативно все и из
> соц.сетей. В такой запаре времени проверять нет.

News journalists took as much as possible and as fast as possible information
from social networks. In such a rush they didn't have a time to check ( _the
information – G.V._ )

**Unbalance between traditional and social media**

There is no proof that the story of taxi drivers was a political manipulation
from the start. The perceived picture could be explained by the nature of the
new media. The effect of the new media was so powerful because of the
information vacuum caused by both mainstream media editorial policy (to
minimize the coverage) and authorities’ information policy (to limit the
access of media to the scene of the attack). On the other hand, we could see
that social media (because of its personalized nature) tended to be dramatic
and easily spread rumors and unverified information.

As _Zyalt_ [concluded](http://zyalt.livejournal.com/348236.html) [RUS]:

> В блогах все обсуждают, как Твиттер заменяет СМИ. К сожалению, СМИ он не
> заменяет. […] СМИ просто не может дать в эфир сомнительную информацию,
> поэтому картинка там не такая яркая, как в блогах и Твиттере. Поэтому у
> многих создается ошибочное представление, что в СМИ недоговаривают всей
> правды, врут и умалчивают факты. Зато в Твиттере все пишут правду.

Everyone discusses now how Twitter replaced traditional mass media.
Unfortunately, it hasn't replaced it. […] Mass media just can not broadcast
information that raise some questions, therefore the picture is not so
colorful as it is in blogs and on Twitter. That is why many people have the
misleading impression that mass media doesn't tell all the truth and silence
some facts while everyone posts the truth on Twitter.

Coverage of the Domodedovo bombing not only revealed problems but also
provided solutions. First of all, social media has a certain level of self-
awareness. It not only covered the events, but also discussed the coverage.
Moreover, we can see that some bloggers (e.g. _Varlamov_ ) made attempts to
get more first-hand information on the spot.

But the self-accountability of social media can’t be sufficient for its
sustainability as a news source. According to Anton Nossik, it has to be
supported by traditional media:

> Мы не будем узнавать новости из Твиттера ни сегодня, ни через 10 лет.  
>  СМИ будут узнавать новости из соцсетей, и нам докладывать. На то они и СМИ.
> А Твиттер с Фейсбуком были, есть и останутся сырьём для их работы.

We will not get news from Twitter neither today, nor in 10 years. The mass
media will be getting news from social networks and will report it to us.
That's why they called mass media. And Twitter with Facebook will continue to
be a raw material for traditional media.

In Russia, the traditional media are not capable of fulfilling their duty as a
tool of information balance. Despite the fact that in the time of emergency
the demand for information is increasing, the Russian media, especially TV,
made artificial efforts to minimize its role trying to reduce the
psychological impact of the terrorist attack on the population. The idea that
[the media should stop to “make PR for terrorists by covering the
attacks”](http://30pin.livejournal.com/151636.html) [RUS] is popular not only
among Russian authorities, but also among media consumers. But minimizing the
coverage has quite opposite effects. It creates informational vacuum and
leaves more space for Internet-based rumors which, in turn, increases panic
and dramatization.

Plus, since the authorities limit the access of traditional journalists to the
scene of the attack, the major source of visual information is user-generated
content.

Not only traditional media, but also the authorities themselves did nothing to
avoid information vacuum. In a country where the president and many officials
use Twitter, one could expect that in the emergency situation these channels
will be used to provide credible information when it is especially important.
There is no doubt that any tweet that comes from official person with any
information about the situation would be re-tweeted hundreds of times and it
would provide some more certainty and balance.

While all government-Twitterers ignored this channel of information, the only
“official” Twitterer to realize this was @KermlinRussia, popular president's
fake account. Several minutes after the bombings, he ceased his ironic style
and started to post real, verified and needed information.

Anton Nossik [concluded](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/1971188.html) [RUS] on
a relatively optimistic note:

> Что же касается телевидения — оно умерло не тогда, когда его бригада
> опоздала на 2 часа в «Домодедово». Оно умерло, когда захотело за нас решать,
> что мы хотим смотреть: новости, сериал или «Большую стирку». В 2011 году
> такие решения принимает зритель.

Regarding TV – it hasn't died when the TV crew was two hours late to
Domodedovo. It died when they decided what we want to watch: news, soap operas
or “The Big Laundry” (popular yellow Russian talk show – G.V.). In 2011, this
decision will be made by the audience.

Aside from both old and new media, as well as authorities, the society, the
fourth important actor, had influenced the observed media effects. The media
problem is not only a matter of journalistic professionalism or the policy of
the authorities, but also the problem of the society. In an emotional post
_angry-ksen_ [described](http://angry-ksen.livejournal.com/71705.html) [RUS]
the atmosphere of apathy among the majority of her Moscow friends:

> Сегодня в Москве произошёл «очередной теракт». Это уже даже не новость. Это
> меньше, чем новость. Это – само собой, как сугробы зимой, отключенная вода
> летом, опаздывающие троллейбусы и стервозные продавщицы. Это не новость,
> потому что это нечто обыденное. Ну, взрыв. А у меня, между прочим, чайник
> кипит. Или мне, как говорится, чаю не пить? <…>Несколько человек
> посоветовали мне не смотреть новости, чтобы не портить себе настроение. Ещё
> несколько сказали, что новости всё равно не смотрят и посему настроение у
> них постоянно-стабильно великолепное.<…> Меньше умерло сегодня в Домодедово,
> чем нас уже давно неживых ходит по Москве.

Today “another terrorist attack” took place in Moscow. It is not even news. It
is less than news. That's something that is as common as snowdrifts in winter,
lack of hot water in summer, trolleybuses running late and rude cashers. It is
not new because it is a routine. Bombing, so what? And I have a kettle bowling
in my kitchen. Does the bombing mean I shouldn't have tea? <…> Several people
advised me today to avoid watching news in order not to spoil my mood. They
also said that they won't watch news anyway and therefore they are always in a
good mood. <…> There are less people who died today in Domodedovo than alive
dead walking on Moscow streets.
