It has been a busy week in Nicaragua. On October 19, the Supreme Court
overturned Article 147 of the National Constitution, which had prohibited
continuous presidential reelection. It stated that a president could not run
for consecutive reelection. The ruling opened a debate whether this was a
legal move by the the Supreme Court. The ruling also opened up the possibility
that current [President Daniel
Ortega](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ortega) from the Sandinista Party
(FSLN) could run for reelection after his term finishes in 2012.

Yesterday afternoon in Nicaragua, the Supreme Court of Justice, through the 6
persons that were appointed as judges of that Government institution, but in
reality they are militants of a political party, declared that a
Constitutional rule is not applicable because it opposes another
Constitutional rule, in other words, they declared the Constitution
unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court decision produced a minor event a few days later, when a
Supreme Court judge, Francisco Rosales (FSLN militant) [was being interviewed
by a local news tv channel [es]](http://www.youtube.com/v/waQBLS2hMdU), when
he was met by a group of young people who attacked him with eggs. In addition,
the United States Ambassador in Nicaragua, Robert Callahan, gave a speech
where he declared the Supreme Court decision [on reelection as inappropriate,
undiscussed, and biased towards one party
[es]](http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/politica/60473). As a result, protests
organized by students took place in front of the US Embassy in Managua.

There was also unrest about the actual budget the universities would receive.
By law, they must receive 6% of the National Budget, a budget that is itself
is being reduced. However, at the same time, there a proposal to create a new
governmental office called the National Council of Evaluation and
Accreditation (CNEA for its initials in Spanish). This office will take over
functions from the National Center of Universities, which approves all
universities in the country and distributes the 6% budget to the public
universities, including giving part of this budget percentage to private
universities.

The 6% Constitutional Percentage has been reducing to approximately 200
million cordobas (about 10 million dollars) and will continue to reduce. The
ones affected will be the students, especially those who do not live in
Managua. Is important to retake the fight for the 6%, there are many who
believe that having a Sandinista government will guarantee the 6%, but they
have forgotten the principles of struggle and have relaxed to follow the
government plan and not the needs of the students, which are or should be the
priority of UNEN (National Union of University Students).

Two accounts have come up from the first protest of October 29th. Gabriela

And the started throwing bottles and water bags, students started to demand
that the television Channel 2 (TV2) and UCA (Central American University)
leave the stage, and one of the bottles directly hit Edwin Castro
(Congressional deputy) while he was declaring the government's support to veto
the law creating the CNEA. You could see blood on his mouth…. most of the
bottles were directed to the cameraman of TV2, there were also some booing
towards Edwin Castro because he was one of the deputies that voted for the
CNEA and now he was here against the CNEA… Inconsistency!!!! Sweet and
comfortable inconsistency!!!

The student in the photo carried a sign reading “Assembly: CNU, UNEN and CNEA
doesn't represent me, We are students, not ignorant! We demand respect to
autonomy and a transparent use of the 6% budget”. Delni Ayala, President of
Humanities Faculty of UNAN accused her of damaging the CNU and asked the crowd
to repudiate her, which the crowd did with water balloons and other objects.

This shows that the Student Movement is divided because the official
association, UNEN, is pro-government, but not all of the students see it that
way. That was one of the reasons that Sandinista deputies were booed by the
crowd when UNEN and CNU leaders invited them up the stage, while its known
they voted for the CNEA law that takes over functions over CNU and 6% budget.

But the grade of hostility achieved its maximum expression one hour later
after the 6% protest. In front of the bust of Casimiro Sotelo, young
sindicalist and martyr who was murdered by the National Guard and who is a
symbol of resistance in our university, we came to protest “in the intimate”
for our scholarships, with some of our neighbors, students from the UNI
(university) and some others from UNAN (university). A group of masked people
– some say they were from the CPCs (Councils of Citizen Power), others from
the Sandinista Youth Association July 19 and even UNAN students – came down
the double cabin pick-up truck and starting to fire “morters” at close range!
At those of us that were protesting and at the university installations… The
result was nine injured, all from the Humanities and Communication Department
and damages to a construction site within UCA. All of this for refusing to
protest in front of the USA Embassy with the FNT (National Workers Front, a
Sandinista party satellite organization), in answer to the declarations of the
Embassador Callahan pronounced a day earlier, which were labeled as
“intrusive”.

The USA Embassy was vandalized [with wall paintings and minor destruction
[es]](http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/60501), and the police had to
fire tear-gas at the end of the afternoon to disperse [the crowd in front of
the building [es].](http://www.elpueblopresidente.com/imagenes.html?album&494)
This second protest was caused by the declarations of the USA Embassador, but
only Sandinista aligned groups supported this protest.

Later, [it was revealed by Twitter user Ojoz
[es]](http://twitter.com/ojoz/status/5267126232) that a crew from TV10 news
was attacked near UNAM, but there was no aparent reason for this attack.
