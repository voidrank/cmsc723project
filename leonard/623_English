Social media played a significant role during the unprecedented Russian
wildfires. The Russian blogosphere
[provided](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/01/russia-towns-and-
villages-on-fire-5/) [EN] hundreds of firsthand examples and exclusive
evidence of the disaster. It
[exposed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/06/russia-fires-rynda-and-
putin-create-internet-meme/) the lack of the government’s accountability and
transparency, bypassing the traditional, state-controlled media. It also
provided an instrument of social mobilization and mutual aid, thus replacing
the unaccountable government with social responsibility of Internet users (as
described [here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/03/russia-
crowdsourcing-assistance-for-victims-of-wildfires/) [EN] and
[here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/10/russia-russian-fires-ru-the-
first-ushahidi-experience/) [EN]).

There is one specific and sensitive issue, however, where social media played
an even more significant role: it was the bloggers who highlighted the sudden
death rate increase among Moscow residents in early August. Combined with
extreme temperatures and air pollution, the smog created the conditions that
proved unbearable for elderly people and those with heart illnesses and
asthma. As a result, numerous deaths were
[reported](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6751T820100809) [EN] by the
mainstream media.

Initially, government officials denied the increase in death rates. Then,
Andrei Seltsovsky, Moscow health department chief,
[broke](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6751T820100809) [RUS] weeks of
official silence: “The average death rate in the city normally is between 360
and 380 deaths per day. Today, we have around 700.”

Health minister Tatyana Golikova
[said](http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/09/dead1/) [RUS] that Seltsovsky's
statistics were misleading and couldn’t be considered as official. At the same
time, the media were [filled with
rumors](http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2010/08/09/3405918.shtml) [RUS] that
suggested that not only had the real number of deaths been concealed, but also
that Moscow health care professionals were forbidden to list heat or smog as
causes of death.

In the era of social media, however, death is something that is difficult to
conceal. On blogs, death becomes more public and personalized, as very often
bloggers write about their own lives. Not only ordinary bloggers discussed the
medical situation caused by the wildfires and heat, but medical workers and
doctors were blogging, too, sharing evidence for various “rumors.”

The first post to raise the issue of the increased death rate and to cause a
significant controversy was written by LJ user
[_mamako_](http://mamako.livejournal.com/) on Aug. 7. The blogger claimed to
work at the hospital and
[described](http://mamako.livejournal.com/704159.html) [RUS] the horror of
“overcrowded” morgues and extreme conditions in hospital rooms:

> […] В корпусе открыты все окна, задымление в коридорах, палатах,
> операционных, процедурных, перевязочных, туалетах и в большинстве
> ординаторских – такое же, как и на улице. В отделении реанимации окна
> закрыты, гари от этого не меньше, но разносится зловоние от гниющих при 40
> градусах повязок и испражнений.  
>  За прошедшие сутки в больнице умерло 17 человек. За позапрошлые – 16. К
> сегодняшнему утру за прошедшие сутки в морге больницы оказалось 65 трупов –
> наши плюс … из окрестных квартир. Трупы складывают в подвале стоя –
> холодильники уже заняты.  
>  Скорая пачками везет стариков с фактическим тепловым ударом, под страхом
> увольнения скорой запрещено выставлять диагноз “тепловой удар, перегрев” (
> потому что у нас – не жарко, у нас в городе – все в порядке).
>
> […]
>
> Такая же ситуация по всем московским больницам.  
>  Кроме, наверное – и к сожалению, – ЦКБ.  
>  P. S. До Кремля по прямой – от силы – 10 км. Только кого это интересует?

In our building, all the windows are open, smoke is in the hallways, in
operating and treatment rooms, in the bathrooms and in most of doctors’
lounges – same as outside. In the resuscitation department, windows are
closed, but it doesn't diminish the smoke, and it stinks of bandages rotting
in the 40-degree heat and of excrements.
