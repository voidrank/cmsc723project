Local government elections in Georgia, including a much anticipated vote to
elect the Mayor of Tbilisi, the former Soviet republic's capital, were held on
30 May and attracted huge interest from both the local and international
community. Considered another test of Georgia's fledgling democratization
process, both deployed and relied on online and social media technologies to
monitor the vote perhaps as never before during any other previous election
held in the country or, indeed, the region.

For about two months prior to the election, reports and monitoring on media
coverage, including the use of administrative resources by the incumbent
mayor, the candidate of the ruling National Movement party of the Georgian
president, were widely spread via email, websites and _Facebook_. The popular
social networking site also served as one of the main platforms for public
debate about the candidates and the local elections in general.

On election day itself, a media center set up by the _Georgian Young Lawyers
Association_ , _Transparency International Georgia_ , and the _International
Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED)_ ran press-conferences every
hour, using mailing lists and _Facebook_ to spread information and
announcements. Shortly before the vote, as well as during the election day
itself, a [website set up](http://cdi.org.ge/geo/main) by the _Civic
Development Institute_ allowed citizens to submit reports on violations via
text messages, phone calls or e-mails.

_Transparency International Georgia_ also deployed a [real-time online
system](http://elections.transparency.ge/) based on information pulled from
several observer organizations on a specially launched website,
_VoteGeorgia.Ge_. The initiative marked the first time such a mapping system
was known to be deployed for elections in the South Caucasus.

A day before the vote, the Georgian branch of the _Institute of War and Peace
Reporting (IWPR)_ also set up their own special coverage site,
[GeoElection.Ge](http://geoelection.ge) [GE] and hired several bloggers,
training them in election reporting before sending them out to different
precincts to monitor as well as spread information through their own online
networks. Some of those reports materialized over half an hour earlier than
news reported by professional journalists on the same website, as
[Dodka](http://dodka.ge) [GE], a blogger and coordinator of that section,
mentioned in her _Facebook_ status.

Others also recognized how important the extensive online coverage was.

Blogging was also used to inform readers of the mainstream media with
journalists from the leftist and critical [Liberali
magazine](http://liberali.ge) blogging from different precincts and political
party offices on election day, while
[Caucasusreports](http://caucasusreports.wordpress.com/), a news blog
contributed to by Georgian, Azerbaijani and Armenian students from the
_Caucasus School of Journalism and Media Management at GIPA_ in Tbilisi, ran
reports. In one post, for example, a Georgian journalist blogged about the
[lack of interest in the local elections from
many](http://charkvianina.blogspot.com/2010/05/voters-refusing-to-vote.html),
while another wrote about the [opposite attitude from first-time
voters](http://journalismania.blogspot.com/2010/05/people-born-
after-1991-independence.html).

The coverage also included reports from the Marneuli region, an area mainly
populated by ethnic Azeris, but also by ethnic Armenians and Georgians. Two
students [reported from the mainly ethnic Armenian-populated village of
Shahumian](http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&site=caucasusreports.wordpress.com&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsunshineann.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F05%2F30%2Felections-

Meanwhile, Ali Resh and a mixed group of Armenian and Azerbaijani students
reported on how the vote was conducted in mainly ethnic Azeri villages. This
included [videos showing an incident where multiple voting was
observed](http://eyesongeorgia.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/many-things-had-to-be-
donelocal-election-in-marneuligeorgia/). In the first video, election
commission members turn those having already voted away while journalists were
present until giving up in the second.

  

In Tbilisi, after results indicated that the current mayor, George Ugulava,
had been re-elected with 55 percent of the vote as compared to the runner-up,
main opposition candidate and former UN Ambassador Irakli Alasania who
received just 19%, bloggers naturally commented.
[Evolutsia.net](http://evolutsia.net/?p=1564) gave an in-depth analysis of the
results, considering that President Saakashvili's National Movement party had
“been rewarded for progress” while also noting that there is “a real market in
Georgia for a credible, moderate opposition.”

> Interestingly enough, Tbilisi, which gave majority votes to the opposition
> in the hotly-contested 2008 presidential elections, this time around swung
> back to the UNM, indicating that opposition-inclined voters were unconvinced
> and unenthusiastic about the current crop of opposition candidates.
>
> Instead, the elections might be taken as an indication that there is a
> considerable pool of support for an opposition, but not if it appears
> immature, endangers economic growth, or is willing to sacrifice Georgian
> sovereignty. In short, certain segments of the Georgian population could be
> persuaded by a centrist alternative to Saakashvili’s UNM.

_DAVID.GE 2.0 ბლოგი_ [GE] also summed up the vote in a [Post-election
Post](http://david.ge/the-rest/post-election-post/), comparing the average
voter to a consumer who has gotten used to wearing old, but relatively
comfortable shoes at the same time as seeing a TV commercial for a newer, more
attractive pair by another manufacturer. Meanwhile, the analogy continued, the
producer of their existing shoes promises a newer design based on customer
feedback.

You are faced with a choice: wait for the revolutionary pair of shoes, if they
ever get produced, or go and buy the new version of your old shoes, which at
least are not worse than the pair you have now, are available right now and,
moreover, promises you more comfort.
