An English literature professor from the little Mediterranean city of Tartous
and a Syrian-Canadian writer on a trip to her mother country exchange glances
at a cafe called Sea Breeze. That's how
_[Mariyah](http://mariyahsblog.wordpress.com/)_ and _[Abu
Fares](http://www.abufares.net/)_ chose to start their adventure, and their
readers’ new addiction.

> A low rumble in my stomach broke into my daydream as a waft of spices and
> seafood drifted enticingly by me. I felt as though I hadn’t eaten in days. I
> looked back through the window and spotted the waitress, resting casually
> near what appeared to be the kitchen door. She had been immersed in a book
> but as though she had a sixth sense, she caught my gaze within seconds of it
> falling on her. She smiled knowingly and approached my table.  
>  “Hungry?”  
>  “Oh, yes! Do you have a menu?”  
>  “Not here. But I’ll tell you what’s being made fresh today.”  
>  “Oh heaven.” I thought to myself and smiled back at her, enthusiastically
> awaiting her description of dinner.

The story starts out as simple as that. The two writers, who are switching
places every week, went from
[there](http://mariyahsblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/collaboration/). We learn
about Yasmina, Prof. Youssef's former student and the waitress at Sea Breeze,
and Yazan, the nonchalant chef, all to the backdrop of Tartous’ marvelous sea
side, and _Abu Fares_ ‘ and _Mariyah_ ‘s exquisite writing.

> When Yasmina was introducing herself my eyes were distracted by the other
> woman. With delicate fingers, she picked a small hot fish by the tail,
> dipped it slightly in a bowl of sauce, brought it close to her lips, blew on
> it to cool it down then swallowed it all, head, bones and tail like a true
> gourmet. She closed her eyes and swam in her own pool of ecstasy. Then… then
> with her other hand, she pulled at a lock of hair which went astray in front
> of her face and shepherded it to join the others behind her ear. It was
> precisely the way she pulled at her hair that made me utterly defenseless.

We are at [Part 16](http://mariyahsblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/sea-side-
