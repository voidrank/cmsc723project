**Are human rights related to motherhood reserved only for married women?
Philippine men and women are blogging about a new legislation related to a
pregnant woman's right to study and work.  
**

In Philippines, a landmark legislation on Women's Rights recently passed after
seven years of debates. It is the Republic Act 9710, also known as the Magna
Carta of Women. It states that womens’ rights are human rights, and their
rights need to be respected at home, at work and in school, also addressing
the subjects of planned parenthood, pregnancy, and pregnant women's rights.

One of the most discussed points in the Magna Carta has to do with the rights
an unmarried pregnant woman has to maintain her job and be able to stay in
school. This is the specific text:

> Expulsion and non-readmission of women faculty due to pregnancy outside of
> marriage shall be outlawed. No primary or secondary school shall turn out or
> refuse admission to a female student solely on account of her having
> contracted pregnancy outside of marriage during her term in school

The Magna Carta clearly states that it is unlawful to fire a pregnant woman
even if she is unwed, but the Catholic Bishop's Conference for the Philippines
(CBCP)[ is insisting on an exemption for women
](http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/220983/unwed-pregnant-and-kicked-out)who study
or work in Catholic schools: They believe they should have the right to fire
or expel unmarried women who are pregnant since it goes against the Catholic
Church's moral religious teachings.

To find out a bit more about the Magna Carta, here is a
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp7BeK-kz24) by the [National
Commission on the Role of Filipino Women](http://www.ncrfw.gov.ph/) where they
explain why the Magna Carta and all its provisions are important:

**Reactions to the Catholic church**

A Philippine blogger, [Lindy Lois
Gamolo](http://lindyloisgamolo.blogspot.com/2009/09/dealing-with-
trespassers.html) criticizes the Catholic church's position. Not only did they
try to boycott the Magna Carta for Women by threatening to excommunicate and
deny communion to the politicians who voted in favor, but now that it passed
the are insisting that they will not support any candidates who are in favor
of the Magna Carta because it doesn't include the addendum they wanted to add
to the text, exempting Catholic schools from following the law. She asks the
politicians to not give in to what she calls blackmail because:

> Let us remind them that they [politicians] are accountable to the sovereign
> Filipino people and not to the Catholic Church and not to the bishops.

However, there are some bloggers who do understand where the Church is coming
from to propose this exemption. Such is the case with one of the comments of a
blog post in [The Feed](http://www.spot.ph/2009/09/17/catholic-schools-want-
power-to-dismiss-unwed-mothers-or-employees/comment-page-4/#comments), where
[olive](http://www.spot.ph/2009/09/17/catholic-schools-want-power-to-dismiss-
unwed-mothers-or-employees/comment-page-4/#comment-9256) writes:

> i agree that if you get pregnant in highschool when studying in a catholic
> school, they should kick her out. why? it doesnt set a good example. imagine

> with a baby in her belly!?!?! its like in your face, sucker!

In fact, not all Catholic schools agree with this proposed exemption.
According to[ Rachel C. Barawid who writes for the Manila Bulletin Publishing
Corporation](http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/220983/unwed-pregnant-and-kicked-
out) there are some schools who believe that denying education to pregnant
women who are unmarried will cause greater harm than good, and she quotes the
Dean of Student Affairs of one of these schools who explains why they don't
expel students:

> If you expel students out of wedlock, it’s a double whammy for them. Now
> that they immediately become mothers, you immediately negate their chance of
> earning a college degree and therefore becoming a professional and providing
> for their child. Not only is she faced with the prospect of being a single
> mother, she is also facing the prospect of not getting a good job because
> she is not a college graduate and will not be able to provide well for her
> child,” she explains.

**Legalizing discrimination against pregnant women?**

Philippine bloggers are also discussing whether it is fair that the Catholic
church, on the basis of their religious teachings is trying to deny human
rights, like the one to hold a job or to receive education, to unwed pregnant
women but doesn't mention the unwed father. It seems to be the just the type
of discrimination against women that the Magna Carta is trying to correct.

[Bong C. Austero ](http://bongaustero.blogspot.com/2009/09/punishing-
unmarried-pregnant-women.html) insists that the Catholic church's proposal
ruling is pure discrimination against women and goes against Catholic
teachings of punishing the sin and not the sinner:

> It penalizes women simply for being women; for having been assigned the
> social responsibility of bearing life. Catholic schools do not punish with
> expulsion or dismissal male teachers who get their girlfriends pregnant when
> they are also just as responsible for the pregnancy.

In the [I am Nobe blog](http://iamnobe.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/i-am-an-unwed-
mother/), where the author humorously steps into a different set of shoes for
each post, it is the turn of the Unwed Mother

> Now you’re telling me that I can’t go to school? Or go to work? (insecure)
>
> I did not have this baby via asexual reproduction! If you should really do
> this to me, let those unwed fathers have a slice of the bitter cake too! And
> for crying out loud, stop giving God a bad name! (beyond hormonal)

[Joyce Talag](http://worldofwomanity.blogspot.com/2009/08/ra-9710-magna-carta-
of-women.html), a single mother herself and blogger, puts forth an argument
that illustrates why, even if the Catholic church penalized unwed fathers as
well, it wouldn't make things better for the mother. Since most single parents
are mothers, denying them of work opportunities or schooling while they are
pregnant will mean they won't be able to provide for themselves or the child:

> A case in point: the single parent. Being one actually means having to
> provide both the economic and nurturing needs of the child. What puts women
> instead of men at a disadvantage is the fact that they comprise most of the
> solo parent population. (Only the [US Single Parent
> Statistics](http://singleparents.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&sdn=singleparents&cdn=parenting&tm=201&f=00&su=p284.9.336.ip_p504.3.336.ip_&tt=11&bt=1&bts=1&zu=http%3A//www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-234.pdf)
> was found on the Internet. It says that “in 2006, 5 out of every 6 custodial
> parents were mothers.” The Philippines’ should not be any different.)

A Philippine law blogger, [Jun
Bautista,](http://philippinecommentary.blogspot.com/2009/09/religious-
exception.html#comment-8896534724107443010) points out that it is unlikely the
Catholic church will include the unwed fathers into the discussion, since the
laws under discussion discuss mainly women.

What this means is that this exception would have to stand on its own, as the
denying of education and work only to pregnant single women, going against
their human rights, and putting their lives at risk, since some even state,
this will morally backfire: if Catholic schools expel and fire pregnant unwed
students, would this push them into having abortions or a life of destitution?
A First District Representative, Janette Loreto-Garin,[ seems to think
so](http://www.thenewstoday.info/2009/03/13/single.mom.stigma.marks.bicam.talks.on.magna.carta.of.women.html).

So, what do you think? Does a religious organization have the right to decide
who they employ or accept as students, or do the rights of the pregnant woman
overrule these restrictions?
