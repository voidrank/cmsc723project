The film “Ajami” was the big winner at last night's Ophir Prizes and will
continue on to international audiences as Israel's foreign film nominee for
the 2010 Academy Awards.

“Ajami” is named for the eponymous Jaffa neighborhood where the story unfolds.
Written and directed by the Arab-Jewish team of Scandar Copti (a resident of
Ajami) and Yaron Shani, “Ajami's” complex storyline reflects a popular
narrative style in Israeli literature and film.

With recent accolades piling up from the Ophir Prize and the Cannes and
Jerusalem Film Festivals, “Ajami's” path is reminiscent of Israel's recent
Oscar nominees, “Beaufort” and “Waltz with Bashir.” To date, “Ajami” has been
the recipient of Ophir Prizes for Best Film, Best Directing, Best Script, Best
Editing, and Best Composition, as well as the Camera D'or- Special Mention at
the Cannes Film Festival, and the Wolgin Prize for best feature film at the
2009 Jerusalem Film Festival.

The movie's trailer is available via YouTube in Hebrew and Arabic with Hebrew
subtitles (no English available at this time). You can also learn more by
visiting its [Facebook fan page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/AJAMI-The-
Movie-2009/111118876031?ref=search&sid=558336523.3636414431..1).

Yudit of _OCCUPIED_ is intimately connected to the movie as she lives in the
neighborhood where the story occurs. She
[reflects](http://yuditilany.blogspot.com/2009/09/ajami-movie.html):

> It hits you in the face, Scandar Kopti's and Yaron Sheni's movie “Ajami”‘
> bluntly. It's overpowering. And yes, this is where i live. It's about “my”
> neighbourhood. Of course this is not going to be an objective film review. I
> know most, no, almost all of the actors, at least by face and some are very
> good friends. The cast has been trained, but they are not professional
> actors, just my neighbours, more or less playing themselves, situations they
> know, reacting naturally as they would have done were the story real. It
> could have been real.

“Ajami” is also the subtitle of Yudit's blog. She explains:

> Ajami, Agami or Adjami, or however you spell its name, it's home. In spite
> of all. The word “home” carries many associations. Mine is located in Jaffa
> (Yafo), once (meaning before 1948) “The Bride of the Sea”, now a slummy
> southern Tel Aviv suburb.

Carmia of _Kishkushim_ [describes](http://kishkushim.blogspot.com/2009/09/and-
winner-is-ajami.html) “Ajami” as:

> A gripping tale of all the _balagan_ [chaos] that goes on in Ajami:
> relations between Jewish and Arab neighbours, West Bankers and Israeli
> Arabs, Christians and Muslims, and everything in between.

Ayelet Dekel of _Midnight East_ chronicles her
[reactions](http://www.midnighteast.com/mag/?p=932) upon viewing the film at
the Jerusalem Film Festival.

> If I had been given a summary of the movie’s plot, I might not have been
> attracted to it, as its events belong to a genre I don’t particularly like.
> Yet Ajami is so much more than its plot, as people are so much more than a
> description of the circumstances of their birth and the events of their
> lives.

Dekel also gives us a peek into the real life of Ibrahim Frege, who plays
Malek, whom she met backstage after the film.

> 19 year old Frege said he had never thought of acting. While still in
> school, friends who participated in workshops of “Peace Child Israel” (an
> organization founded in 1988 by David Gordon and Yael Drouyannoff to teach
> coexistence using theater and the arts) invited him to come along just for
> fun. He participated in the theater workshop for a year, and then received a
> phone call asking him if he would like to be in the movie. He thinks they
> were looking for someone with an accent similar to that which might be heard
> in Nablus, his character’s hometown.

Finally, film critic Yair Raveh of the _Cinemascope_ blog
[postulates](http://cinemascopian.com/2009/09/26/ajami-wins-ophir-goes-to-the-
oscars/) whether “Ajami” could garner an Oscar nod.

> Could “Ajami” become the third Israeli film in three years to get a
> nomination for best foreign language Oscar (after “Beaufort” and “Waltz With
> Bashir”)? Regretfully, I have to say I doubt it. “Ajami” is an outstanding
> film, and in many ways a breakthrough in Israeli cinema, but it might be too
> realistic, gritty, true-to-life, and perhaps too confusing for the average
> Oscar voter. And it lacks the pre-awards buzz that “Waltz With Bashir” had
> last year, and “Lebanon” is getting right now. But, who knows.
