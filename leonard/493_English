A few days ago, a motion was tabled in the Malaysian Parliament to suspend
Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim for six months for linking Prime Minister
Najib Razak’s 1Malaysia concept to that of ‘One Israel’. Ibrahim had also
alleged that global public relations firm Apco Worldwide was behind both
campaigns.

On one hand, there are some who feel that the suspension of Anwar along with 3
other MPs (who were suspended as well after criticising the ‘parliamentary
disciplinary probe’) was unjustified.

Ghkok [said](http://malaysiakini.com/news/151029):

> This is the result of 53 years of one-party rule. It breeds arrogance and
> oppression. It is like a disease. There is no respect for members of
> parliament who are legitimately elected by the rakyat, and who have brought
> up a legitimate issue in Parliament (where it should be brought up).

Khoo Kay Peng [also
believes](http://khookaypeng.blogspot.com/2010/12/parliament-is-inflicted-by-
perak.html) that it was a decision that will not be beneficial for the
country:

> The motion to suspend opposition MPs Anwar Ibrahim, Karpal Singh, Sivarasah
> & Azmin Ali from parliament for six months is a prime example of abuse of
> parliamentary majority.
>
> The motion would be passed effortlessly by Barisan's brute majority in the
> parliament. The consequence is severe and unfortunate for our parliamentary
> democracy.
>
> The august house will now be inflicted by the Perak disease which has
> brought chaos to all sittings so far. Imagine what can a day long state
> assembly sitting can do to a healthy debate on important bills and budgetary
> decisions? Nothing.

However, there is also the sentiment that the Opposition (Pakatan Rakyat) is
no different from the Barisan Nasional Government, like the one Charles Hector
[shared](http://charleshector.blogspot.com/2010/12/pakatan-guiltybn-guilty-
suspension-from.html).

Blogger Biggum Dogmannsteinberg [shares the same
opinion](http://bigdogdotcom.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/pot-calling-the-kettle-
black/).

The Opposition had also marched to the Malaysian Human Rights Commission to
protest against the suspension, and plans to seek a judicial review over the
matter.
