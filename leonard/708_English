[![Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

was swift and secret. Kevin Rudd has been replaced as Prime Minister of
Australia by his deputy Julia Gillard. She is the nation’s first female PM.
News of the challenge broke on Wednesday night and Rudd stepped aside the
following morning. You can find some background to the dramatic decline in
Kevin’s popularity and his fall on my
[blog](http://laborview.blogspot.com/search/label/Kevin%20Rudd).

This post looks at other bloggers’ reactions to what has been called a
political assassination and worse by some commentators. These are the voices
of people who rarely post about politics or are not part of the regular
commentariat.

_Rorybaust_ in his ‘ramblings of a bemused individual’ was no fan of the PM
but was bitter about the way he was deposed:

> I felt for Kevin Rudd simply because he had been betrayed so publicly, so
> humiliated that no man deserves, not a man whose soul aim was to serve his,
> mine and your country. Kevin Rudd may had failed as a leader and maybe he
> should have stepped down but the actions to remove him are so devoid of
> respect for our most important job that I doubt the integrity of people that
> orchestrated this.

Like many others, he did not turn against the new leader but kept an open
mind:

> Julia Gillard may prove to be a good leader of our country, she may prove to
> be a successful Prime Minister in her own right, I just think this is an
> ugly stain on her tapestry.

> throwing-out-the-rubbish-leaves-sourer-taste/)

_Bill Kerr_ , at his self-titled blog, blamed the Australian Labor Party
backroom bosses for Rudd’s sudden end:

> There is little difference between ex PM Rudd and new PM Gillard. The main
> reason for the change is that the factional bosses of the Labour Party
> seized their chance to remove Rudd who had refused to play their game by
> ignoring them whilst relying on his direct electoral popularity (which faded
> once he renounced his climate change scheme).

Like the devout ex-PM, Cath Swan at _New Day_ , is an avowed Christian. She
expressed empathy for his extraordinary removal:

> For many reasons the shining glow of Kevin Rudd's climb to glory in 2007
> dulled significantly in 2010. The many supporters and political allies’ very
> quickly turned to administer the final blows to Kevin's demise. Relieved of
> duty by a woman must to any red-blooded, testosterone charged male be a
> humbling hit.
>
> It seems unfair, wrong and utterly humiliating for him.  
>  [The coup that was!!](http://cathyswan.blogspot.com/2010/06/coup-that-
> was.html)

As the title of his post indicates, Bushfire Bill at the _Political Sword_
seemed torn between support for Gillard and admiration for Rudd’s
contribution:

> Well, after a good night's sleep and a bit of a think, count me in on the
> Julia side.
>
> It seems Rudd isolated himself, and treated the caucus and the cabinet with
> seeming indifference.
>
> Why this is so, I don't know.
>
> Could this have been his personal nature?

After a lengthy analysis of Rudd’s strengths and weaknesses, he concluded:

> His mistake was to hold on too tightly and too long. I for one can forgive
> him easily and say to him, with love, “Kevin, job well done”. It is up to
> him now to forgive us.  
>  [thank you kevin](http://www.thepoliticalsword.com/post/2010/06/25/Thank-
> you-Kevin.aspx)

Peter at _Holties House_ , ‘All About Australia. The Land I Love’, summed up
what he saw as Rudd’s achievements:

> Just 31 months into his term as PM “Kevin 07” crashed from a popularity
> rating of 70% to a shattering 37%, even so his short term as PM has some
> memorable moments, he was the PM who apologized to the indigenous population
> for the stolen generations, he steered us through the World Financial Crisis
> without the nation slipping into recession, and he battled honorably for an
> Emissions Trading Scheme to help with the Climate Control problems.

‘ _Same Same_ is Australia's #1 gay and lesbian lifestyle website.’ They asked
a range of lesbians and gays to comment on the change of leadership.

Michael Rolik believed that:

> The Rudd Government began the process of delivering major reforms for gay
> and lesbian equality throughout their first term. We look forward to a
> Gillard Government continuing that process.

Tim Wilson was not so sure:

> The Rudd government was big on symbolism, but not on delivery. Gillard has
> to break that dynamic and stand up for what is right and then deliver on it.

M. ‘Lorenzo’ Warby, at _Thinking Out Aloud,_ blogs mostly abut books and films
not politics. The unprecedented events stirred his cyber pen:

> Now, as it happens, Julia periodically says things I agree with while I just
> found Kevin irritating, but that is not the point. The problem with Kevin
> Rudd as PM was simple: he is a domineering control freak and you cannot be a
> successful PM of a modern democracy if you are a domineering control freak.
> You have to be able to listen, to consider because modern societies are just
> too complex for a single individual or narrow clique to understand the
> ramifications of actions and policies. In particular, you have to be able to
> listen and consider if you are going to be at all persuasive.

Dr Marko Beljac's _Vile Maxim_ , ‘Ranting and Ravings Against Neoliberalism’
saw the Prime Minister’s defeat as a victory for the mining interests who
opposed his Resource Super Profits Tax proposal:

> The mining industry decided that it would destroy Rudd and destroy him they
> did. The change over has been fulsomely praised by all of Australia’s peak
> business bodies. The ascent of Julia Gillard comes with the promise that
> they will be “consulted” better, as if they have not hitherto been consulted
> enough already.

Alexis Ituarte, a final-year High School student, blogs at _Lex-icology_. He
echoed what many others felt when they saw Kevin Rudd’s emotional speech after
his downfall:

> I’m not sure where I stand in the land of politics or what I think of Rudd
> (or Gillard for that matter) but the most important thing that I took out of
> today was that Kevin is a person like the rest of us, with a conscience,
> with passion, and perhaps sometimes well-meaning.

_Rhiannon Hart_ usually writes about ‘young adult books and writing, fantasy,
dystopia, paranormal’. She was one of many who were excited about having the
first woman in the job:

> In Australia we are all still reeling from the news that K-Rudd (Prime
> Minister Kevin Rudd) was booted/stepped aside from the prime ministership
> yesterday morning (depending how you look at it), and into the helm stepped
> Julia Gillard … who is a woman! Our very first female PM, in fact.
>
> There's a lot of grumbling going on, but also a lot of celebrating. I for
> one think it's absolutely fantabulous that after a long history of Old White
> Men PMs we have a woman (and a ranga!) bringing a bit of diversity to the
> portraits that hang in Parliament House.

Finally Patricia who writes poems at
[POLYPOMES](http://polypomes.livejournal.com/) left this as part of a
[comment](http://cafewhispers.wordpress.com/2010/06/24/kevin-rudds-decline-
and-fall/#comment-1529) on one of my posts:

> I often write political ‘pomes’ tongue in cheek. I suspect what I wrote this

> We held our leader in high regard,  
>  Watched helpless as he was daily mauled

>  And dirty, with no holds barred.  
>  And finally when he lay bleeding,  
>  Victim of press gallery canard,  
>  Yes, we killed him because we knew  
>  He was near dead, so battle scarred

>  No choice but for the old praetorian guard

The first [opinion
poll](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/26/2937691.htm) after the
‘coup’ has shown a bounce for the government. My next post will look at the
blogosphere’s response to Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s first week in the hot
seat.
