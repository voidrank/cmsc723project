The mobilizations that started on May 15 in Spain have gradually evolved into
local meetings, gatherings and different kinds of initiatives all over the
country. Most activists are not focusing on the camps any more. Campers have
decided to leave the Madrid square “Puerta del Sol” on June 12, 2011. It
became the physical symbol of the people's unease with their political
representatives. Netizens are calling this shift “Sol se mueve” (Sol is
moving), and using the tag
[#solsemueve](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Solsemueve) on Twitter.

This does not mean that the movement has died. Assemblies and reunions co-
exist with specific actions, like the marches towards city councils on June 11
to protest against the investiture of politicians charged with corruption. In
Madrid, the capital city, a sit-in ended up with police charging against
demonstrators, which can be seen on the videos widely shared online, like this
one by journalist Juan Luis Sánchez of

Two days before, on June 9, people marched towards the Congress to protest
against the latest budget cuts that have left many people in precarious
economic situations and in an even more vulnerable position. This was widely
covered [by Spanish
media](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/06/11/madrid/1307782506.html) [es].
It was also the most commented topic through social media that day, mainly
through the
[#15mfrentealcongreso](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2315Mfrentealcongreso)
tag:

Some people also oppose the mobilizations and insist that the police evict
activists from public spaces:

> [DarkPlooKoon](https://twitter.com/DarkPlooKoon): Hay más policía que
> civiles y no pueden desalojar. ¿Que es esto señor Rubalcaba? ¡VERGONZOSO![
> #19J](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2319J)[
> #15MFRENTEALCONGRESO](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2315MFRENTEALCONGRESO)

[DarkPlooKoon](https://twitter.com/DarkPlooKoon): There are more policemen
than civilians and they can't evict them. What is this, Mr. Rubalcaba?
Shameful! [ #19J](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2319J)[

[Note: Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba is the Deputy Prime Minister]

The mobilizations show an increasingly wider gap between the people and the
government in Spain, which has become even more visible after three members of
the international hacktivist organization Anonymous were detained under
accusations of “piracy and hacking of official websites.” The police proudly
announced the detention through [an official communication [es]:  
](http://www.policia.es/prensa/20110610_2.html)

> La cúpula del grupo Anonymous ha sido desarticulada en nuestro país.

The leadership of Anonymous group in Spain has been dismantled in our country.

The pictures in which the Police shows the masks that the members of Anonymous
use to engage in allegedly criminal activity have been widely shared online:

Shared by Policía (Spanish National Police) on Twitter

The arrest has been widely covered [by international
media](http://www.europapress.es/portaltic/internet/noticia-detencion-
miembros-anonymous-impacta-prensa-internacional-20110610175659.html). It has
also led Spanish Internet users to make fun at the government's lack of
understanding of how the Internet works:

> @dbravo: Nada, un grupo de amigos que se reunen siempre en un mismo sitio.
> No digo más, que nos desarticulan.

@dbravo: Im meeting some friends at our usual spot, but I´ll say no more so we
are not dismantled.

Anonymous, just as most Spanish netizens, have fiercely opposed the passing of
the[ 2009 Sustainable Economy
Bill,](http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/PopUpCGI?CMD=VERLST&BASE=puw9&DOCS=1-1&DOCORDER=LIFO&QUERY=%28CDA20100929006114.CODI.%29#%28P%C3%A1gina1%29)
which allows the government to decide which sites should be blocked or have
their content removed, representing a big blow against net neutrality (please
read post [on Global Voices
Advocacy](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/10/spanish-
intellectual-property-law-global-netfreedom/)). It is another proof of the gap
between people and their political representatives, which has caused different
participatory initiatives to foment political awareness. Movements have also
grown in other countries, becoming more and more global, as seen in this video
