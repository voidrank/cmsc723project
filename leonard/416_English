Two separate demonstrations, held in Amman, Jordan, on Friday, February 4th,
ended peacefully. This week saw King Abdullah II dismissing Prime Minister
Samir Rifai, champion of economic liberalization, in favor of former Prime
Minister Maarouf Bakhit. Bakhit is of Jordanian origin and from a military
background. His appointment has been [interpreted](http://www.black-
iris.com/2011/02/02/thoughts-on-king-abdullahs-appointment-of-bakhit-as-
jordans-new-prime-minister/) as a display of the King's desire to consolidate
Jordan's loyalists and mollify those angry with rising food and energy costs.
Bakhit's appointment was not, however, met without
[complaint](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110202/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_jordan),
with Islamists in particular charging that Bakhit is not capable of carrying
out political reform.

After Bakhit's appointment, the King further attempted to stave off Islamist
criticism by [meeting
with](http://petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?lang=1&site_id=2&NewsID=20765&CatID=14)
Islamist opposition leaders. After these actions, two separate protests were
held the afternoon of Friday, February 4th. The first was held downtown, the
site of ongoing protests against (now former) PM Rifai. This week, the
protests were against the appointment of new PM Bakhit and in solidarity with
the Egyptian people.

At 12:30 pm Amman time, Mahmoud al-Hamawi
[reported](http://twitter.com/#!/Hamawii/status/33473594616971264) the events
of the protest minute-by-minute, tweeting a series of slogans being chanted
and displayed at the downtown protest:

> ما بدنا نغير حكومات … بدنا نغير سياسات Downtown , amman now AngryJordan
> #ReformJO

We don't want to change governments, we want to change politics

He continued for the next half hour,
[updating](http://twitter.com/#!/Hamawii/status/33474489970860032) every
couple of minutes with slogans both against the new prime minister and in
solidarity with Egypt. Around 1 pm, Tololy
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/tololy/status/33480793569492992) that pro-
regime demonstrators had appeared:

> Ten people carrying king's pictures clash with protesters in #Amman #JO
> #ReformJO #ArabProtest

But just ten minutes later, she
[updated](http://twitter.com/#!/tololy/status/33482801995190272):

> Police intervene to break up clash in #Amman but don't stop the protest #JO
> #ReformJO via @AmmanNet

Also at around 12:30, Samih Toukan [tweeted vague
information](http://twitter.com/#!/samihtoukan/status/33477625674473472) about
a demonstration in front of the Prime Minister's Office in Amman:

> Its raining in Amman but I can hear chants of people in demo in front of
> priministry not sure how big and what r they chanting #ReformJo

This protest started at the Prime Ministry before
[marching](http://ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleNO=79655) to the Egyptian
Embassy, located a short distance away. By 1:30, Ali Abu-Nimah
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/avinunu/status/33488111212175360):

> Estimate a couple thousand outside Egypt embassy in Amman despite heavy
> rain. Will post video later. #jan25

This number seems wildly inflated from [other independent
reports](http://bit.ly/g4kIMp). Thoraya
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/ThorayaER/status/33491873079230464) her
disappointment with the protest:

> #JO protest quite Islamic. Leader quite uncharismatic. Boring. Time to go
> home #NoJOReformhere

She [added](http://twitter.com/#!/ThorayaER/status/33495646405136385):

> Protest in front of #Egypt embassy in #JO seems very staged & scripted by
> authorities to ensure ‘acceptable’ msg #JOReform #Fail #BS

Despite minor clashes at the downtown protest, both demonstrations ended
peacefully, perhaps curtailed by rain throughout the capital.
