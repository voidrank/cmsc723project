In South Korea, the highly controversial [Four Major River
Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Major_Rivers_Project) has proven to
be a train-wreck. Despite strong public opposition, the current President [Lee
Myung-bak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak), has been pushing this
project since the start of his administration.

The Korean Board of Audit and Inspection released [a shocking
report](http://media.joinsmsn.com/article/424/10452424.html?ctg=-1) [ko] on
Jan 17, 2013 claiming that the government's nation-wide construction project
has proven to be a total mess. The current administration has been touting it
as a Korean version of the [New Deal
policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal), an American economic growth
strategy from the 1930s. They even pushed bills through the National Assembly
despite growing environmental concerns. The government has asserted that it
will [create new jobs and improve water quality.

However, mass [algae-
outbreaks](http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2957572)
have been reported in several rivers in 2012, which many believe somehow
correlate to the construction.

An unprecedented 22 trillion Korean Won (about 20 Billion USD) has been spent
and more is expected to be spent for maintenance work since 15 out of 16 water
reservoirs have proven to be defective. As warned by environmental groups, it
has had a detrimental effect on the environment; the [COD
index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_demand) (Chemical Oxygen
Demand) has increased by 9 percent and the algae level rose 1.9 percent.

Sadly once the damage has been done, it cannott be undone. Influential net
user [@kennedian3](https://twitter.com/kennedian3) lashed out at the report in
his series of tweets, blaming the concerned government departments and the
president for inflicting [irrevocable damage
](https://twitter.com/kennedian3/status/292074909394432000)[ko]:

> 4대강사업 단군 이래 최악의 국책사업이었다. 그 국토부 관료들과 정치인들, 학자 등 각 분야 추진 세력과 이명박대통령에게는 반드시 법적

He also [assailed the audit
board](https://twitter.com/kennedian3/status/292073631851360256) [ko] for not
releasing the report till now, just a month before the new president will be
sworn in. It has been reported that the audit board had already [finished
their second round of
auditing](http://joongang.joinsmsn.com/article/786/10460786.html?ctg=1000)
[ko] last September.

The opposition party and environmental groups now [strongly
demand](http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/570257.html) [ko]
the current administration and ruling party to take responsibility for this
catastrophe. [@wspark](https://twitter.com/wspark) from the opposition

The major conservative newspapers have also been blamed for being Lee's poster
boy during his term. [@mattayoon](https://twitter.com/mettayoon)

[@kyung0](https://twitter.com/kyung0)
[lamented](https://twitter.com/kyung0/status/292078526524444673) [ko] the sad
reality that despite the mess, no one from the power house will ever be fully
held accountable. President Lee will be [awarded the Grand Order of Mugunghwa,
](http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=050000&biid=2013011174278
)the highest decoration awarded by the Korean government when he retires:

The president-elect [Park Geun-hye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-
hye) [seems to distance
herself](http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/570257.html)
[ko] from this failed project, but one Twitterer
[warns](https://twitter.com/mettayoon/status/292071767667769345) [ko] that
Park, who is from the same conservative ruling party, cannot be totally free
from the liability and added it could be a scarlet letter haunting Park in the
future.
