Earlier this month clashes at the Katunayake Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in Sri
Lanka between protesting workers and police claimed life of an young worker
and injured [over 200 workers and
policemen](http://www.jdslanka.org/2011/05/over-100-hurt-in-sri-lanka-
workers.html). The FTZ workers were protesting against the Sri Lanka
government's proposed Private Pension Scheme.

Katunayake FTZ [manufactures around](  http://www.ft.lk/2011/06/10/govt-will-
consider-compensation-on-boi-recommendation/) 30% of export products, most are
involved in the garment industry, one of Sri Lanka’s top three foreign
exchange sources. After the clashes the FTZ remained closed for 2 days
resulting in huge loss.

free-trade-zone-no-police-in-sight/) some videos (by
[Vikalpa](http://www.youtube.com/user/vikalpasl)) of the protests on Thursday,
which occurred after the police killed 21 year old FTZ worker Roshan Chanaka.
Here is one:

Srilankan Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mahinda Balasuirya
[resigned](http://www.eelanatham.info/?p=771) after the incident and two
police officers who escalated the clash [were
arrested](http://www.groundreport.com/World/Two-Police-Officers-Who-Involved-
In-Clash-With-Fre/2939347). A presidential inquiry was initiated.

On the next day hundreds of Buddhist monks [came
out](http://blogs.geegain.com/post/14156/the-limits-of-the-mahinda-chintanaya-
ftz-workers-and-buddhist-monks-rise-up-against-government) for the first time
to protest against the killing outside the President’s house.

So what does this protest mean for Sri Lanka? _Rasika Jayakody_
[explains](http://groundviews.org/2011/06/03/people-are-not-a-flock-of-sheep-
the-murder-of-a-21-year-old-by-the-police/):

> This particular protest, done by Free Trade Zone workers in Katunayake, has
> given an unexpected shock therapy to the ‘big shots’ of the government who
> are intoxicated with power and high-handedness. It has sent them a clear-cut
> message about people’s agitation towards their snobbish political behavior.
