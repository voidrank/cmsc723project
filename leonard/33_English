Every Tuesday, a group of visually impaired photographers come together in
Manhattan, New York City. Some of the people attending are partially blind,
while others have suffered from visual degeneration at an early age, or they
were born blind. The name of the group is [Seeing with Photography
Collective](http://www.seeingwithphotography.com/swpc_home.html) (SWCP).

In a book titled [Shooting
Blind](http://www.seeingwithphotography.com/swpc_shooting_blind.html), Mark
Andres, the founder and head of this collective, explains that he has had many
roles in this organization. As a matter of fact, he has worked as music
arranger, guide, instructor, coworker, and sometimes as the main photographer
or assistant. This means that cooperation among the team members and the
volunteers commitment are the key of the group, for which light painting is
the most common technique.

We share some photographs by the members SWPC (all of them republished with
their permission), and a video by Steven Erra, one of the artists of the
collective. These images depict some of passions and interests of the
photographers. We hope you enjoy them!
