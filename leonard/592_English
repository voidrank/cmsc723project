As it was widely
[reported](http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/article/11/four_dead_as/),
a flood of red sludge hit villages in Western Hungary earlier this week. The
disaster caused by a spill of toxic material from an alumina plant reservoir
affected seven villages in the area: Tüskevár, Kolontár, Kisberzseny,
Somlóvásárhely, Apácatorna, Devecser, Somlójenő. (A zoomed-in map with the
reservoir is

According to a Saturday
[report](http://nol.hu//ajanlo/20101009-mar_het_halottja_van_a_katasztrofanak)
[HUN] of the Hungarian newspaper Népszabadság, the number of casualties is
seven, one person is still missing. Many of the inhabitants were burnt by the
toxic mud flowing through the village.

**In need of urgent help**

The Hungarian government started a [website](http://redsludge.bm.hu) with
information on the red sludge, the arrangements made and the situation in the
area. By Saturday, the inhabitants of Kolontár have been evacuated because of
the risk of a new spill. At an [on-site press conference](/?p=117#more-117),
the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán said: “[…] late last night cracks
appeared in the northern wall of the reservoir; it is assumed that there is a
danger of another failure. Experts have analysed the condition of the wall and
have determined that there is a real risk that the wall would collapse and
that the red sludge behind it would spill out. […]”

The press release also stated that some 750 people have been evacuated from
Kolontár because of the risk of another spill, law enforcement forces are
standing by in case the nearest settlement Devecser with its 6000 inhabitants
needs to be evacuated as well. Meanwhile, dams are being built to protect the
residents.

The officials have also set up a national bank account called the [Hungarian
Relief Fund](http://redsludge.bm.hu/?p=122). [George
Soros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros), a Hungarian-American
businessman, sent $1 million to the victims of the red sludge, and [George
Pataki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pataki), former governor of New
York of Hungarian descent, addressed every Hungarian in the world to help the
families in need.

The video below also includes information for those who would like to help the
victims. The footage was shot by a Hungarian television channel's crew right
after the flood hit the settlements: people were covered with the red sludge,
houses were blasted by the wave of the toxic spill.

Tamás also [reported](http://meszarostomi.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/por-
szennyezes/) [HUN] on Saturday's evacuation due to the mud drying and turning
into floating powder. This may also be toxic, so he had to wear a mask when
buying food.

He [wrote](http://meszarostomi.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/tovabbi-segitseget-
varunk/) [HUN] they still needed rubber boots, blankets, sleeping bags and
help with the cleaning.

A [Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=165104783503354&v=wall) [HUN] was
set up to collect information about what was missing from the settlements
affected; Magdi Novák's [blog](http://vorosiszap.blog.hu/) is doing the same.
