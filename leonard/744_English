The game began in the early part of 2009. Eastwood Tavern in Pretoria, South
Africa, erected a sign that read “World Cup 2010” along with banners that
included the flags of many football playing countries and the words “Twenty
Ten South Africa”. FIFA responded to what it termed ambush marketing by
lodging an application at the Pretoria High Court under section 15A of the
South African Merchandise Marks Act. FIFA obtained the judgment with costs
against Eastwood Tavern on the grounds that the pub infringed on its
registered trademarks World Cup 2010, South Africa 2010 and Twenty Ten South
Africa.

Roll forward to February 2010. Similar game but slightly different players –
this time FIFA and [Kulula](https://www.kulula.com/), a budget airline from
South Africa. The airline, who is not an official sponsor of the World Cup,
produced an advertisement in a local newspaper with the tag line “Unofficial
National Carrier of the You-Know-What”. This again sparked legal action by
FIFA, who objected to the fact that Kulula featured vuvuzelas and the South
African National flag.

[World Cup blog](http://www.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/fifa-
has-1-billion-in-reserve-funds-but-still-doesnt-appreciate-clever-
advertising.html) stated plainly:

> First of all, can I assume I’m not alone in finding that ad absolutely
> hilarious? Rather than straightforward trying to cash in on the World Cup in
> a cheap and nasty way, Kulula have instead made a clever and defiant gag at
> the expense of FIFA’s heavy-handed copyright and licensing laws.

Not to be outdone, Kulula went a step further with this ad:

South Africans lapped up every inch of the David and Goliath battle. In [Chris

He goes further:

The game did not end there. [Soccerway.com

frustration-in-safrica/)reported on 11 May 2010:

and
