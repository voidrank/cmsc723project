Since its launch in 1976 as a research project in rural Bangladesh, [the
Grameen Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank) has walked a long way
to become what it is now, a microfinance organization and community
development bank with affiliated ventures in many countries of the world. More
than three decades later and boosted by many awards including the Nobel Peace
Prize (jointly with its founder Dr. [Muhammad
Yunus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus) in 2006), it has expanded
into [a family of social
organizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_family_of_organizations).

Each year many volunteers and activists from the world come to visit the
Grameen organizations to learn how they work and gather first hand
experiences. This summer, eight students and faculty members from the Master
of Public Administration program of the Northern Kentucky University (NKU) in
Kentucky, USA are completing an internship in Bangladesh at Grameen Bank. They
have made numerous field visits and are recording their experiences in their
blogs using texts, pictures and videos.

_Beth_ , the MPA program editor shares her experiences in her blog “[They're
taking me to Bangladesh](http://bangladeshbeth.blogspot.com/)“. It was hard
for her to adapt to the rural infrastructure during field visits and [she
commented](http://bangladeshbeth.blogspot.com/2010/07/ive-adapted.html):

> Being in the country at the villages is so much different than the city. It
> is greener. The air is less polluted and it definitely is much quieter.

A number of students are also blogging about their experiences. _Mike_ posts
some videos in his blog _[‘Wait… this is how many miles
away?!?!?!!’](http://michaelwalther.wordpress.com/)_

[This
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnE7M4Z7TI&feature=player_embedded)
contains the first visit of the NKU team to Dhamrai, the center meeting, etc.:

_Brandi_ ventured to [learn more about
Bangladesh](http://theblistblog.com/2010/07/24/learning-more-about-about-
bangladesh/) and she was able to attend a Bangladeshi wedding. She is excited
about her visit to [Grameen Shikhka](http://www.grameen-
info.org/grameen/gshikkha/index.php) (Grameen Education) and writes her
experiences in two posts titled [“I can never forget how blessed I
am”](http://theblistblog.com/2010/07/25/i-can-never-forget-how-bless-i-am/)
and [“Grameen here, Grameen there, Grameen
everywhere”](http://theblistblog.com/2010/07/26/grameen-here-grameen-there-
grameen-everywhere/).

_Tim_ [elaborates about Grameen
Shikkha](http://timd2009.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/grameen-and-education/) and
how children are having their education besides working to earn livelihood:

> Yesterday and today we visited a school programs called Grameen Shikkha, a
> non-formal school program for slum children and initiative of Grameen which
> aim is to offer a basic education (English, Bangla, math skills, social
> sciences and the environment) so that when they grow older, their employment
> opportunities are enhanced. Odds are that without this program, these
> children would have no education opportunities. [..]
>
> School runs from 2pm to 5 pm. Outside of these hours, all of these children
> work. Most get up early to work (around 6 am) in whatever their family
> business is – mostly tailoring – in this neighborhood. After class, they
> return and work until at least 10 pm. The work because the family needs them
> to as those who live in the slums earn very little (anywhere from $4 – $11
> per day depending on what the children there told us their goods sold for)
> and need their kids to help. [..]
>
> These kids work six days a week with this schedule. I will never complain
> about my workload again…can you imagine being a child and not having the
> time to play?

_Lynne_ writes about her experiences in posts like [Grameen Fisheries, Danone
and Eye Care](http://sowestimeast.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/grameen-fisheries-
and-grameen-danone/) and [Poverty is Poverty and Smiles are
Smiles](http://sowestimeast.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/poverty-is-poverty-and-

hospitality](http://sowestimeast.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/bangladeshi-
hospitality/).

_[Tori Ames](http://toriames.wordpress.com/)_ posted a lot of pictures in her
posts, e.g. about [Grameen
Fisheries](http://toriames.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/grameen-fisheries/) and
[Social Business](http://toriames.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/social-business/),
[street children](http://toriames.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/street-children/)
and a [government primary
school](http://toriames.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/banbareia-government-primary-
school/). She writes:

> I really love Bangladesh and its beauty. I am sure you can tell that from my

_Brandi_ writes in her [last post](http://theblistblog.com/2010/08/03/going-
out-with-a-bang-in-bangladesh/):

> Today is our last day in Bangladesh and I can’t believe the trip is coming
> to an end. I’ve had such a wonderful time learning about Grameen Bank and
> the country as a whole. There is so much that I will miss about this country
> that I am hoping I have written enough, taken enough photos, and committed
> enough to memory to not let the things I love here escape me.
