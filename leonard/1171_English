Is it possible to change telephone companies and keep the same number? It is
an option available in the United States for several years, which is often the
benchmark for comparison in the Dominican Republic. Up until a few months ago,
it was seen with some disbelief among Dominicans, even though the official
sector has been pushing the project for number portability.

Things took a definitive turn when the [Dominican Institute of
Telecommunications [es]](http://www.indotel.gob.do/) (Indotel, for its
initials in Spanish) announced last April that the company that will manage
the number portability platform has been selected . This responsibility falls
to the Information Technology division of the Spanish consortium [El Corte
Inglés](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corte_Ingles), a decision that initially
caused skepticism, as noted by Joan Guerrero of the blog _Duarte 101 [es]_ :

> Desconozco la experencia y los criterios de selección que tuvo Indotel para
> seleccionar El Corte Inglés como futuro proveedor de este servicio en
> nuestro país. Haciendo un repaso rápido, este consorcio español tiene varias
> unidades de negocio y una de ellas es el aspecto de implementación de
> servicios como este. En España, esta empresa es que maneja la portabilidad
> numérica entre operadoras y de seguro, en varios países de la región
> latinoamericana. Tuve la oportunidad de preguntarle a Luis Rafael Pellerano,
> asesor legal de esta iniciativa, el por qué no se hizo la implementación de
> la portabilidad con una empresa local, que conocería el mercado mucho mejor.
> Tan sólo me dejó dicho que la selección de esta empresa valió por su
> presencia mundial; sin más detalles. Creo que esto deja mucho que desear.

I do not know how or the selection criteria used by Indotel to select El Corte
Inglés as the future provider of this service in our country. Making a quick
review, this Spanish consortium has several business divisions, one of which
implements services like these. In Spain, this company manages the numeric
portability service between operators and probably has presence in various
Latin American countries. I had the opportunity to ask Luis Rafael Pellerano,
legal adviser for this initiative, why they did not use a local company, which
knows the local market much better, to implement the portability project. He
just told me that the selection of this company was worth it because of its
global presence; without going into more details. I think this leaves much to
be desired.

Aside from this initial skepticism, some of which was generated because El
Corte Inglés is primarily known as department stores in Spain, the issue of
number portability was discussed on several blogs, always from the standpoint
of consumer: How much does the average Dominican know about the issue? What
implications will it have? At the moment there are great expectations for
improved service offered by telephone companies, as well as fair and open
competition.

Darío Martínez, a reader of _Duarte 101 [es]_sums it up:

> La portabilidad numérica, si sale como se espera (excelentemente bien), será
> lo más positivo que tendremos los dominicanos en materia de servicio
> telefónico. Las telefónicas estarán OBLIGADAS a brindar un servicio
> excepcional a nosotros, pues cambiarse de empresa será un trámite sencillo y
> barato. Las telefónicas han perdido su mayor elemento de retención de
> clientes: ¡Ya los números telefónicos NO son su propiedad!

Number portability, if it goes as expected (excellently), will be the most
positive thing that we Dominicans will have with telephone service. The phone
companies will be OBLIGATED to provide exceptional service to us, because
changing companies will be a simple and cheap process. The phone companies
have lost its largest elements for customer retention, now phone numbers are
NOT their property!

Will number portability fulfill expectations? In two weeks, starting on
September 30, the plan will take effect, and the phone companies have already
started with the allusive publicity, as has Indotel, with a simple, yet
effective radio and television campaign with the clear and simple message:
from now on, everything changes, except the number. Indotel has also used its
[Twitter account [es]](http://twitter.com/indotel) to countdown the days until
the measure takes effect, but also to answer questions about the changes.

On that date, the Dominican Republic will become the 3rd Latin American
country to implement number portability, with Mexico and Brazil as pioneers in
that area. Many believe that it will be a simple and painless process: for
only 80 pesos (approximately $2.20 USD), payable in 4 installments of 20 pesos
per month, the user is entitled to carry over his or her current number,
provided that he or she gives notice of the decision before canceling the
current contract.
