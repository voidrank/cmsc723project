_“Once upon a time my island was a tropical paradise. It is a tropical
paradise no more.”_

That is how Ursula Rakova described the state of her homeland during [a recent
panel discussion during Climate Week in New York
City](http://overbrookfoundation.blogspot.com/2009/09/women-from-across-globe-
lead-panel-on.html). She has been a vocal and tireless activist to raise
awareness and attract support to lead the relocation of the residents of the
[Cataret Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carteret_Islands) in Papua New
Guinea. These islands are gradually being flooded due to the rising sea
levels[ attributed to climate
change](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/03/29/1017206152551.html), and it
is predicted that the islands will be completely submerged by the year 2015.

Higher levels of seawater have destroyed crops and harmed supplies of drinking
water. As a result, as seen in this video produced by the [United Nations
University](http://vimeo.com/unu), the residents on the islands have been
going hungry.
