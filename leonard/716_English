At least 46 people were killed and an estimated hundreds remain missing since
Friday June 18, after torrential floods swept through the neighboring states
of Alagoas and Pernambuco, north-east Brazil, in the worst environmental
tragedy in the local population's memory. Dubbed the ‘northeastern tsunami,
the floods have been compared to similar catastrophes in Asia, such as the
2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

At least 180,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, with many finding
shelter in schools, churches or with family members. Most people have lost
everything they had and rely now solely on humanitarian help. The delay in the
arrival of aid means that people are going hungry and sick.

From Santana do Mundau, one of the most affected cities in Alagoas, a citizen
reporter recorded the moment the flood [took the
city](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OZIKVtE6i0) last Friday. YouTube user
[TheWelligton1](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheWelligton1) shot the video from
the roof of his house:

After having lost everything, [Teresa
Aragão](http://vivamaisviva.blogspot.com/2010/06/enchente-em-palmares-pe-
estou-viva.html)[pt] has published pictures of the destruction around her and
celebrates to be alive, safe and sound after the biggest catastrophe she has
seen in her city, Palmares (Pernambuco). She has been also using her own blog
to provide local news and coordinate donations for those in need [especially
those with disabilities](http://vivamaisviva.blogspot.com/2010/06/preciso-de-
donativos-para-pessoas.html):

It was the biggest catastrophe I have seen in my city, the biggest flooding
ever! Everyone in my family has lost everything. We have no clothes,
documents, medicine. Thank God, there were no deaths in the family. There is a
huge despair, it is a real chaos of mud and debris, cars upside down and under
water… a total wreckage.

According to [Gilvan Júnior](http://bezerrosagora.blogspot.com/2010/06/volume-
de-chuvas-em-alagoas-e.html), a month's worth of water was dumped on the
affected areas in less than a week – June is normally the wet season in
Brazil, but this volume of precipitation was not foreseen:

> Na capital alagoana, a expectativa era que chovesse 298,3 milímetros (mm)
> durante todo o mês, mas até ontem (22) foram registrados de 470,2 mm. Em
> Recife, choveu 456,7 mm até a manhã de hoje (23), enquanto eram esperados
> 388,9 mm em todo o mês.

In Maceió, capital of Alagoas, it was expected 298.3 millimeters (mm) of
rainfall throughout the month [of June], but 470.2 mm were recorded up to
yesterday [June 22]. In Recife, there were 456.7 mm of rainfall up to this
morning (23), while expected 388.9 mm of rainfall throughout the month.

Some small towns have been almost completely destroyed by the floods, while
entire communities by the banks of Mundau and Capibaribe rivers, in Alagoas
and Pernambuco respectively, were completely washed away. Collapsed bridges
and flooded roads left many towns cut off; there is no electricity, fresh
water or telephone services in most places affected. Lays [describes the
desolate picture in
Alagoas](http://dreamsandteamsbrasil.blogspot.com/2010/06/sos-alagoas.html)
[pt], including the [situation in
Branquinha](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/latin_america/10400010.stm), one
of the poorest cities in the country, that has suffered over 90% of
destruction and will need to be rebuilt in a different location:

> Em cidades como Branquinha e Quebrangulo não restou um só prédio público de
> pé. Não há postos de saúde, mercadinhos ou farmácias que possam dar uma
> ajuda emergencial à população. Essas cidades terão que ser reconstruídas por
> completo, visto que também nenhuma documentação restou nos cartórios de
> registro públicos.

Not even a single public building remained in cities like Branquinha and
Quebrangulo. There are no health posts, markets or pharmacies to give
emergency aid to the population. These cities will have to be rebuilt from
scratch, and even all documentation was lost in the public registry offices.

The blogosphere is devasted by the news of floods of this magnitude in an area
already wrecked by extreme poverty. However, it was the news that the main
cause of the disaster was not just the adverse weather conditions but the
environmental destruction that left many angry. [Alcides
Faria](http://alfaria.blogspot.com/2010/06/aldo-rabelo-e-o-desastre-de-
alagoas.html) [pt] has taken the opportunity to send a message to a local
politician who defended some controversial environment policies:

> Como todos sabem, o ocorrido em Alagoas também está relacionado ao
> desmatamento e à não proteção das microbacias. A vegetação marginal de
> córregos, lagoas e rios é essencial para conter o assoreamento e a crescida
> rápida do nível das águas.

As we all know, the problem in Alagoas is also related to deforestation and
the lack of [vegetation] protecting watersheds. The vegetation by the side of
lakes, streams and rivers are essential to stop landslides and refrain the
quick rise of river waters.

Many bloggers have published information on how to help. Solidarity networks
start to appear offline and online, such as [SOS
Alagoas](http://www.sosalagoas.al.org.br/), a website that uses OpenStreetMaps
to map the most affected areas and to provide information about donation
centres. Bloggers brace together in setting up an [emergency topic
blogging](http://www.aquinacozinha.com/2010/06/sospernambuco-urgente.html) to
raise awareness about ways to help.

[Décio Junior](http://paineldjrx.blogspot.com/2010/06/tragedia-no-
nordeste.html) [pt] says that the images reminds him of the Tsunami in
Indonesia and the earthquake in Haiti. While everyone is thinking about the
World Cup in South Africa, he tries to catch people's attention to more urgent
matters:

> Mas não há diferença para a mãe natureza, não há hiato, não há desigualdade.
> A tragédia pode acontecer para John ou pra João.  
>  E é uma pena ter que repetir esta retórica, mas preciso de alguma maneira
> contagiar todos os tocedores nesta corrente pelo Brasil.
>
> Vamos juntos, tudo é um só coração, um só povo irmão. Pra frente Brasil,
> salve seus filhos, salve seus irmãos.

For Mother nature, there is no difference, no hiatus, no inequality. The
tragedy may happen to João or to John. It is a shame to keep repeating this
discourse, but I need to find a way to encourage everyone to join this
solidarity network for Brazil.

Let's go together, we have just one heart, one brotherhood. Ahead, Brazil.
Save your sons, save your brothers.

After a few fairly dry days, the rainy weather that has plagued the area over
the last several days will not come to an end, at least for a while. According
to the National Weather Service, the rain forecast for the next days could
cause rivers and streams in the area to rise again, and make it difficult for
rescue teams to reach affected areas.

The areas affected are part of the northeastern Brazil, a region wracked by
extreme poverty and normally affected by extreme dry weather and drought.
Floods, however, have become a recurrent annual disaster: [in May
2009](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128059008), at
least 44 people were killed and 380,000 displaced in the same areas.
