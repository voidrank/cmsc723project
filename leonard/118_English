Following events in the Middle East and in India, where young people harnessed
the power of social media to achieve civic goals, Nepali youngsters concerned
about the country's political chaos are eagerly [embracing this
technology](http://bhumikasa.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/lex-limbu-on-the-
facebook-movement/).

On Saturday May 7, 2011, [hundreds
gathered](http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Facebook+brings+hundreds+to+streets&NewsID=287061)
at a public square in Kathmandu demanding that the constitution be drafted by
the May 28 deadline. This event was unique to Nepali activism and political
scene because social networking site
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/nepalunites#!/nepalunites?sk=photos) played
vital role in organizing and encouraging the participants.

Pradeep Kumar Singh at
[_NepaliBlogger_](http://nepaliblogger.com/events/youths-stand-up-to-bring-
change-in-nepal/2028/) said that this new approach towards activism and
organizing is certainly a path-breaking event for Nepal.

> I am not sure how many of you among nine thousands that responded to attend
> this (Come on Youth, Stand Up!) event on Facebook actually went for this
> event, but still this was definitely a huge one! Nepali Youths organized a
> peace rally in Kathmandu, today to pressurize the leaders to give full
> commitment to the constitution writing process and to aware every youth
> (sic) to raise voice against every misdeed of the leaders.

_[NepalUnites](http://nepalunites.com/) _organized the protest rally. Unlike
traditional brick and mortar groups which function offline through traditional
communication medium and have still not integrated social media into their
operation, NepalUnites is very active at Facebook,Twitter and YouTube. This
has helped them reach youth audience, in Nepal and also among non-resident
Nepali communities.

[_Lex Limbu_](http://www.lexlimbu.com/2011/05/london-stands-up-for-nepal.html
), a full time student who blogs mostly about culture and music, is organizing
a similar event in London along with Pradeep Kumar Singh. Under the banner of
[Nepal Unites London](http://nepalunites.com/), they are organizing a protest
meet on May 27 in front of the Nepali Embassy in London.

> If you at home wish to take part in this then please don't think twice and
> just come and attend the event. While you're at it, why not come with some
> home-made posters and banners with simple slogans and message's urging the
> government to ‘Act Up’ or ‘No Work, No Pay’.
>
> We love to complain about the situation in Nepal, blame our politicians and
> the political frame so I hope all those people who actively blame can take a
> break from blaming from home but join us – to be a bigger force, to unite
> and send the message back home. At the end, we shall hand over a letter to
> the embassy.

While these events are getting positive coverage in the Nepali and
international mainstream media, some are not amused. At
[_Mysansar_](http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2011/05/id/18880), a popular
Nepali blog, Deepak Aryal compared the youngsters who organized and
participated in the rally as “fraudsters”:

> आफूमात्र ठीक र राम्रो देख्‍दै सभ्यता, इमान्दारिता वा नैतिकता र सदाचारको ढोंग
> रचेर हामीहरूले अरूलाई गाली गर्न सक्छौं र गरिरहेका छौं, तर हामीले आफ्नो
> उत्तरदायित्व कति निभाएका छौं? हामी कति इमान्दार र कति ठीक छौं? त्यो कसले
> जाँच्ने हो? त्यसको वारेमा कसले फेसबुकमा आन्दोलन गरिदिने हो? माथिल्लो क्लासका
> मान्छेलाई फेसबुकमा अरूलाई गाली गर्न र सुझाव दिन फुर्सद छैन अनि तल्लो वर्गलाई
> त्यसमाथिको पहुँच छैन।

We believe that only we are correct and good, and we create illusion of
honesty and ethics to bad mouth others; but how many of our responsibilities
have we actually fulfilled? How honest and correct are we? Who is going to
judge that? Who is going to fight for that at Facebook? The upper class is
busy bad mouthing others and doling out advices at Facebook, but the lower
class has cannot access it.

Aryal views the Facebook revolt phenomena as part of class wars going on in
Nepali society. _C K Lal_ , a prominent columnist, echoed similar sentiments
through his column at [_My
Republica_](http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=31323).
His assertion that the protesting youth somehow mirrored Kathmandu's feared
gang members has raised many eyebrows.

> It was a motley crowd of about hundred to two hundred youngsters. Most of
> them were in trendy slacks and t-shirts. One demonstrator had made up his
> hairs to resemble the famed mane of late-lamented Satya Sai Baba (May his
> soul rest in peace) and apparently did not believe in shouting slogans.
> Cheerleaders of the rally appeared to be mostly UML-types: The kind who are
> protected and patronized by Chakre Milan and Dinesh Adhikari Chari, the
> Marxist-Leninist strongmen of Kathmandu valley.

Judging the vastly different reaction to the Facebook organized rally, it is
clear that a tussle inspired by cold war era views on class war, is underway
in Nepal. The dislike that Facebook is receiving from a section of Nepali
society is not just antagonism towards technology, it represents deeper
dissatisfaction towards the perceived class rift.
