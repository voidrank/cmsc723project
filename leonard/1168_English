screenshot-211x300.png)[_Bekhsoos_](http://www.bekhsoos.com/web/) is an online
magazine “covering topics related to (homo)sexuality in the Arab world”.
Founded by the Lebanese group [Meem](http://www.meemgroup.org/), a support
community for lesbians, bisexuals, queers, questioning women, and transgender
persons, _Bekhsoos_ was recently relaunched and will publish weekly from now
on.

“Bekhsoos” means “concerning…”, and is a
[reference](http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/4653-show-them-were-
not-zoo) to the changing topic of each issue. As well as news articles and
opinion pieces, _Bekhsoos_ includes poetry, fiction, and personal stories that
focus on queer and transgender identities in the Arab world. It also
[plans](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2009/09/lebanon-queer-
arab-magazine-relaunches-online.html) more investigative reports.

_Nadz_ , one of the editors, explains the [relaunch](
http://www.bekhsoos.com/web/2009/08/the-evolution-of-us/):

> This is the new Bekhsoos. We’re back after almost a whole year of no
> publishing (the last issue we put out was in December 2008). So what’s
> different? For one thing, we’ve decided to publish weekly. […] Bekhsoos.com
> started out as a replacement for a “real” print magazine. We knew we
> probably couldn’t manage printing a magazine because we’d need lots of money
> to purchase a publishing license, do the printing, and it wouldn’t fit too
> well with Meem’s underground nature. At the time (exactly 2 years ago),
> Bekhsoos online was a replacement. Today, and with the way information
> sharing has evolved, it is clear to me that Bekhsoos actually belongs
> online. That’s where young [LGBT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT)s in
> Lebanon are looking for information, connections, and support. So it’s up to
> us to provide the information quickly, accurately, and consistently.

_Nadz_ continues:

> The age of “wow, gay groups in Lebanon, that alone is impressive” is over.
> It’s not impressive anymore. Now is the time for us to become engaged with
> our own societies, to think analytically, to advance politically, to
> understand the truth about oppression, to create, to research, to be
> proactive, to write, to write, to write! The LGBT community has always had a
> strong online presence – way before people were calling it “ICT [information
> and communication technologies] 4 social change” and “social networking.”
> That’s because we had no other choice. So we built websites and chatrooms on
> [mIRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC). Then we became bloggers. Then we
> came out on MySpace and started groups and causes on Facebook. Then we
> started a [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/meemgroup). Now,
> we’re tweeting. And guess what? The world is now moving into our side of the
> playground. And when media moves online, they’re coming to where we are
> strong and numerous and unafraid. They’re coming to where the younger
> generations are. And no, of course, this side is not the best because it
> leaves out the older generations, it leaves out the people who can’t afford
> internet or computers, it leaves out my mother. But they are on the course
> to getting there. It’s getting more affordable, more Arabicized, and more
> widespread. The Middle East is adding [500,000 internet users a
> month](http://www.digitalproductionme.com/article-1708-middle_east_adds_500000_internet_users_a_month/).
> That’s 6 million a year. If the queer community is everywhere online, then
> the internet users are bound to bump into us somewhere. They’re bound to
> listen to what we have to say.

A recent _Bekhsoos_ article was called “[5 Reasons Health Care for Lesbians in
Lebanon is at Stake](http://www.bekhsoos.com/web/2009/09/5-reasons-health-
care-for-lesbians-and-bisexual-women-in-lebanon-is-at-stake/)”:

> Lesbians and bisexual women are alienated from the health care system in
> Lebanon. Barriers to medical care that lesbians face can cause poorer mental
> and physical health. […] Heterosexism and homophobia are endemic in Lebanon.
> “Coming Out” to your physician, even though essential, might be challenging.
> […] Lack of any adequate training of health care providers about lesbian
> health issues. The absence of formal education about homosexuality in
> medical school and residency training leads to an alarming lack of
> understanding of health issues relevant to homosexuals. Misconceptions and
> dogmas about homosexuality are prevalent in Lebanon. […] Some physicians
> still believe homosexuality is a mental disorder even 15 years after the
> World Health Organization has removed homosexuality from its list of mental
> illnesses.
