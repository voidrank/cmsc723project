For many, the news that Bolivian President Evo Morales would name ex-Miss
Bolivia [Jessica Jordan, 25,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jordan) as
the[ Movement Towards Socialism
(MAS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Socialism_%28Bolivia%29)
party candidate for governor of the Department of Bení seemed like a late Day
of the Innocents (Bolivia's version of April Fools Day) joke. However, when
the announcement became official in a live televised press conference, the
reaction became immediate on Twitter, as well as the reaction to those
reactions. After the dust settled, bloggers also began to provide their
thoughts about the matter.

Initial opinions on Twitter were ones of disbelief that a former beauty queen
would be nominated to participate in the elections in such a high-ranking
position. Diego Arrázola (@darrazola)

Not even for council member JESSICA JORDAN, but for GOVERNOR! What is
happening? Is it still Day of the Innocents?

It is hilarious about Jessica Jordan….there aren't more people in Beni? No
more young people with dreams? What a shame..

There were similar messages of disbelief, and many referred to the fact that
Jordan was the former Miss Bolivia. However, others thought that it was not
fair for people to react in this manner. Patricia (@arquitecta)

What is the matter with you all? You think it is normal when someone ugly
takes power, but when the candidate is beautiful, you complain…it is machismo!

[criticizes those that have already written off the
candidate](http://ecopold.blogspot.com/2010/01/jessica-jordan-mi-

Then there are those who forget their own positions regarding gender equality,
who say that surely the girl is beautiful, but it is unlikely that her head is
useful for something other than fixing her hair. Seeing the quality of
governors that Beni has had so far, I doubt that one can criticize the
beautiful Jessica Jordan for that matter. I am sure that she will show
aptitude on the matters that she will deal with, I've always thought that
beauty and intelligence are not incompatible at all.

One of the major questions that this nomination raises is “What's in it for
MAS?” [Beni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beni_Department) is a department in
the Bolivian Orient that has traditionally been under the control of the
opposition. Placing a nationally-known figure, who has not been a party member
or active in politics is seemingly attracting the attention of the entire
country and could turn the tide in that part of the country. Hugo Miranda of
_Angel Caido [es]_ [adds his
thoughts](http://angelcaido666x.blogspot.com/2010/01/jessica-jordan-burton-

This is worth commenting, maybe it is obvious that the MAS is using public
figures in the Departments where it does not dominate, in order to win the
Governorships and Mayorships, in this way to have total control over all of
Bolivia.

Maybe for some, Jessica is being used for those ends by the all-powerful Evo
Morales.

The doubt remains, and I think that Jessica deserves all this because she
loves Bolivia very much.

The strategy seems to be working as some bloggers who have been apolitical, or
even in opposition to the MAS party are starting to support Jordan. However,
some are making it clear that their support is going to the candidate, and not
the political party. Even those people who are not eligible to vote in the
Department are expressing their desire to help the candidate. It still remains
to be seen whether the strategy will work in the elections scheduled for April
4, 2010.

Miranda, who has not been a supporter of the MAS party, writes that the one
candidate that [he will support is Jordan to the extent that he will include
free campaign advertising on his
sites](http://twitter.com/angelcaido666x/statuses/7497160177). Durán

I think that the election in Beni will be the most interesting of all of the
April elections. In addition, from this platform (his blog) I announce that I
am willing to travel to the beautiful lands of (Beni) to help out in the
campaign.
