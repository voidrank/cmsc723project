On November 9th, Mexicans welcomed the afternoon filled with images: [Google
Street View](http://maps.google.com.mx), the service that takes high-quality
photographs at the street level for major cities of the world, was released
for Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, and other 5 Mexican cities. At the
same time, some of those cities were updated with important informational
layers, such as public transport routes, as well as locations for hospitals,
movie theatres, and museums.

Early this year several users recognized Google’s car, equipped with camera
that takes 360° horizontal and 290° vertical panoramic photos. Mexico is the
first Latin American country to have its streets digitally mapped, which
nowadays includes many cities of United States and Canada, as well as
countries from Europe, Asia, and Oceania.

Street View in Google Maps México

Mexicans showed mostly positive reactions to the service, although some
expressed natural concerns for their privacy. User hekma [expressed on Twitter
[es]](http://twitter.com/hekma/statuses/5665888472):

> Mi jefe vio Google street View en Mexico y comenzo a tener panico… demasiado
> diria yo…

My boss saw Google street View on Mexico and started to panic… too much I
would say…

Another common first reaction to the service is to look for someone's house or
office. [Twitter user Rafaesp
[es]](http://twitter.com/rafaesp/statuses/5630516600) did this and found his
mother in front of his house:

> Orales, en la foto de mi casa de Google Street View Mexico, sale mi madre
> recibiendo una notificacion para mi del IEDF… .

Wow, the picture of my house in Google Street View Mexico shows my mother
receiving a notification for me from the Electoral Institute of the Federal
District… .

Twitter user avomx [considers
[es]](http://twitter.com/avomx/statuses/5593203951) that the images of Street
View unintentionally make a social commentary:

> Muy buena herramienta, pero como que se ven feitas las paredes grafiteadas y
> las calles llenas de baches ¬_¬

Very good tool, but streets seem ugly with the graffiti on walls and filled
with potholes ¬_¬

User mexico_df [also perceived a contrast
[es]](http://twitter.com/mexico_df/statuses/5592705624) of the living
conditions of the Mexicans:

> Con google maps Mexico view street puedes ver algunos contrastes de nuestra
> ciudad casas de cartón y residencias inimaginables. Interesante

With google maps Mexico view street you can see some contrasts in our city
cardboard dwellings (sic) and unthinkable residences. Interesting

Few days after its release, users were already developing useful projects with
one of the most frequent uses of Google Street View: virtual tours. The
blogger that is known as Juan Crouset [provides historical details of the city
of Monterrey in his posts [es]](http://juancrouset.blogspot.com/), and [has
taken Street View to guide his readers
[es]](http://juancrouset.blogspot.com/2009/11/un-paseo-virtual-por-
monterrey.html) through old constructions. This makes an interesting contrast
with his regular contributions that usually are supported with historical
documents and photographs. A sample of his work:

[Street] Juan Alvarez with Guadalupe Victoria, Industrial neighborhood. Very
close to the bus station. A house with American influences, probably
constructed for workers of some nearby business. Much of the constructions
that were originally covered with aluminum ceilings are in very good
conditions due to the properties of metal ceilings to avoid humidity
filtering, albeit the abandonment of some of them.

Several newspapers have already made coverage of the service, including
collections of images that show [urban decay in Mexico City
