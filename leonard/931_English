In Valladolid, Spain, Film-making is taught to children without them having to
use a camera. Following are some of the videos showcasing the process and
final results of these workshops.

[The Asociación Espacio Rojo](http://vimeo.com/espaciorojo) (Red Space
Asociation) is the one organizing the workshops, and this is how they
introduce their vision:

> Actualmente, Estamos realizando el Taller ‘Mi primera película’ que es un
> taller práctico de cine sin cámara. Este taller presenta la forma de hacer
> cine, películas sin cámaras usando técnicas y soporte cinematográfico como
> medio de expresión.

Currently, the “My First Movie” workshop is taking place, a practical film-
making workshop without using cameras. This workshop shows the process of
making movies on film without using cameras, using different techniques and
projectors as a means of expression.

[Following is a video](http://vimeo.com/7308756) with the children's first
movies:

In the latest workshop, which took place on December 27th, the kids painted on
16 mm film: then all their strips, were spliced together. In [this

machines used to splice their film:

In this [next video](http://vimeo.com/8366446), in addition to the process,
