The push by multinational corporations and foreign governments in recent years
to obtain fertile land in African countries such as Ethiopia, [Madagascar
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/21/madgascar-kenya-question-widsom-
of-foreign-land-deals/)and Tanzania has spurred debate over whether the move
will lead to development or is simply a “land grab” that further threatens the
continent's food security.

**Land rush**

There has been growing interest by foreign investors to buy or lease large
areas of arable land in sub-Saharan Africa, either to grow food for their own
countries or to export it for profit. The [land rush has been
triggered](http://www.alternet.org/world/145970/billionaires_and_mega-
corporations_behind_immense_land_grab_in_africa), says an article in South
Africa's _Mail & Guardian_, by worldwide food shortages and food security
concerns that followed oil price rises in 2008, water shortages and the
European Union’s insistence that 10 percent of all transport fuel come from
plant-based biofuels by 2015. Others say [population growth](http://mid-east-
today.blogspot.com/2009/12/arab-countries-outsourcing-foreign-farm.html) is
also a factor.

Investors say these acquisitions will fuel development, but opponents call the
move a “land grab” that will threaten Africa's own food security and
livelihood. Stacy Feldman, writing for _SolveClimate News_ , [elaborates on
the situation](http://solveclimatenews.com/news/20090521/biofuels-watch-
african-land-grab-deals-questioned):

> Researchers revealed that foreign companies are buying or leasing vast
> chunks of land in Africa and elsewhere for their own use. In fact, up to 50
> million acres have been sold off or soon will be. That's equivalent to about
> 25 percent of all the farmland in Europe. Much of that land is being bought

In Ethiopia, farmland is being bought or leased on an immense scale. The
country has approved 815 foreign-financed agricultural projects since 2007 and
land is being leased for approximately $1 per year for 2.5 acres, according to
the _Mail & Guardian_. The country [gave out 600,000
hectares](http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/ak241e/ak241e00.htm) (1.48 million
acres) to foreign entities between 2004 and early 2009, according to a report
by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Meanwhile, Ethiopia remains one of the hungriest countries in the world.
Earlier this year the Ethiopian government said some [2.8 million
people](http://reliefweb.int/node/387995) are in need of emergency food aid in
2011. Forty-one percent of the population is
[undernourished](http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/data/country/profile.aspx?loc=81).
This paradox has [angered some
Ethiopians](http://www.mitmitaye.com/2009/10/mitmita-girls-meles-
mercenary.html), including the women behind the blog _Mitmita_ , who compare
Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, to a goat:

> Look at Prime Minister trying to convince everyone that he isn’t a land
> hording communist—it's a land giveaway! Are you a foreigner? Do you have
> cash? Well Melesocracy has a stimulus plan for you! The Mitmita Girls are
> quite familiar with a few project finance deals ourselves; from what we
> understand, in these intricate transactions, Third World governments in
> collaboration with First World financiers orchestrate what are tantamount to
> beads for Manhattan deals where like the Native Americans, ordinary
> Ethiopians are bilked out of inheriting our land because a man with an
> uncanny resemblance to a goat has sold it to the Chinese.

**Hi-tech stimulus?**

But proponents of these land deals, including the Ethiopian government, say it
will bring capital, technology, agricultural knowledge, infrastructure and
lots of jobs to impoverished rural areas where subsistence farmers use low-
tech tools. One government official, reported Fred de Sam Lazaro in a piece
for _PBS Newshour_ that was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting, says that Ethiopia has an abundance of land and [barely five
percent of it](http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/ethiopia-hunger-and-
abundance) is being cultivated by the country's farmers.

Berhanu Kebede, Ethiopia's ambassador to the United Kingdom, said last month
in _The Guardian_ that the country [must significantly develop mechanized
agriculture](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-
matters/2011/apr/04/ethiopia-land-deals-food-self-sufficiency) to reach the
development goals unveiled in Ethiopia's [latest development
plan](http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/08/13/is-ethiopias-development-
plan-too-ambitious/), which aims for an average economic growth of 14.9
percent over a five-year period. A doubling of agricultural output, the plan
says, will fuel that growth, and so the government has put aside 3 million
hectares (7.4 million acres) of land to be leased. The government says the
country may not even need food aid within five years.

The blog _Govindan Online_ , written by an former Indian diplomat, calls these
land investments [a welcome
development](http://kgovindan.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/world-population-and-
food-grain-production/):

> Bringing in large areas of land under cultivation and building
> infrastructure will generate large scale employment even if these sectors
> are completely mechanized. Since land utilization in these continents is
> very low, compared to other continents, there is not going to be any
> ecological problems. It is also to be remembered that some European
> countries including Russia have sold/leased out land to foreigners with a
> view to increase local food grain production.

**Speaking out against “land grabs”**

Many farmers, land rights advocates, various
[reports](http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/?q=node/view/526) and non-
governmental organizations disagree. They call the situation a “land grab”
that may lead to environmental destruction, displacement of small, local
landholders, worker and resource exploitation, loss of livelihoods and food
insecurity. Some say it's a [new form of
colonialism](http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/32023).

Many bloggers have also spoken out against the land grabs. Devinder Sharma, an
Indian food and trade policy analyst blogging on _Ground Reality_ , calls
these foreign investors “[food pirates](http://devinder-
sharma.blogspot.com/2009/06/food-pirates-indian-firms-buying-farm.html).”
Woldegb, commenting on Kebede's piece in _The Guardian_ , says it is [very
unrealistic to believe](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-
matters/2011/apr/04/ethiopia-land-deals-food-self-
sufficiency?commentpage=1#comment-10303566) that foreign investors can improve
food security, and Nyikaw Ochalla, posting on _Anyuak Media_ , [refutes many
of Kebede's claims](http://www.anyuakmedia.com/com_11_4_11.html).

Blog _The Africanist_ says the deals will [likely lead to
violence](http://www.africanist.org/2009/07/05/land-grab-in-the-21st-century/)
and questions the logic of providing food aid to countries that are exporting
food. Nabeeha Kazi Hutchins, blogging on _The Hunger and Undernutrition Blog_
, points out that little has been mandated to [protect the land and the
interests of local communities](http://www.hunger-
undernutrition.org/blog/2009/11/the-great-ethiopian-land-grab.html) and Ellen
Albritton, blogging on _CMH 365: Public Health and Social Justice_ ,
[questions the
ethics](http://publichealthsocialjustice.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-big-
land-grab-in-ethiopia-who-is-benefiting) of benefiting from food grown in
Ethiopia while Ethiopians starve.

RAH, commenting on a post on the blog _Brown Condor_ , says there are [four
questions](http://browncondor.com/events/2010/08/27/move-over-china-here-
comes-india-taking-land-in-ethiopia/) that should first be answered:

> Number One: Will this adversely affect Ethiopian farmers in any major way?  
>  Number Two: Will these foreign countries/companies abuse and or harm the
> land in any way?  
>  Number Three: Will this drastically cut the water supply to downstream
> nations that depend on water from the Nile?  
>  Number Four: Will all of this NEW REVENUE truly benefit the people of
> Ethiopia or just mainly the government?

The FAO says [little is still
understood](http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/KHII-7SE4R4?OpenDocument)
about the impact of these international land deals. In response, the
organization is drawing up a code of conduct to bring equitable shares for all
parties in these deals. Perhaps such a code will help offset what the blog
_Yene Ethiopia_ believes is the government's [shortsightedness in approving
such land deals](http://myethiopia.wordpress.com/2010/01/15/eprdf-continues-
its-self-serving-disastrous-policies/):

> The Ethiopian government makes it seem as if 50 or 100 years from now
> everything will be as it were before the lease. After producing under highly
> mechanized, intensive farming, the land will no longer be productive. The
> sizes being given away are not benign. Is there a plan beyond selling the
