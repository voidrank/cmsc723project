As Haiti slowly treads on the path to recovery and rebuilding, there is a
sense of renewed concern for the countries children-especially the orphans.
Various news agencies have been reporting on child traffickers targeting
vulnerable children in the country, including this report at
_[CNN](http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/25/evening-buzz-protecting-haitis-
children/)_.

The orphan debate has a lot of US connections because [the arrested church
group was
American](http://www.hiphopmusic.com/best_of_youtube/2010/02/haitian_child_believed_she_was_going_on_brief_vacation_news.html)
and a lot of the orphans were destined for USA if adoptions continued. On the
US blogosphere, the opinion on the missionaries seems to be divided, and the
attitude of the US Department of State is also being questioned.

At the legal blog [_Right Juris_](http://law.rightpundits.com/?p=1208),
blogger _Ryan_ questions the State Department's handling of the situation. In
the light of facts that have emerged-that 22 out of 33 “orphans” the
missionaries were trying to get to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic have
living parents, and the group did not have necessary permission and
documentation to take the children out of country; the State Department has
decided to take the “hands off” approach.

Brazen attempt of the missionaries to go through their mission, without ever
seeking necessary permission in the United States or in Haiti has raised
doubts.

_Paul Shepard_ at the blog [_Black Spin_
](http://www.bvblackspin.com/2010/02/02/arrested-baptist-missionaries-may-
face-u-s-trial/)says that the missionaries have a tough road ahead.

_Te-Ping Chen_ at
[_Change.org_](http://globalhealth.change.org/blog/view/when_charity_in_haiti_kills_children),
questions the children focused relief effort in Haiti. In her thought
provoking post titled “When ‘Charity’ in Haiti Kills Children”, Chen examines
the effect the missionaries’ arrest is having on volunteers who want to travel
to Haiti to help.

_Chen_ joins a growing list of people, including some very well known names,
who are asking whether is it an act of kindness to remove Haiti's children
from the country in search of better life. [_Washington
Post_](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/02/08/AR2010020802729.html?hpid=opinionsbox1)
columnist Eugene Robinson has criticized the missionaries for the brash
attempt, saying that “True charity would have been to help those families care
for their children — not to put them in a bus and drive them away. “

_Marc Herman_ at a previous post in [Global
Voices](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/11/haiti-why-all-the-stories-
about-orphans/) noted that surprisingly the voice of Haitian themselves has
been muted on the orphans issue. He also highlights a sudden rise of interest
on Haitian children after the earthquake.

Late Wednesday evening, a Haitian judge ruled that 8 of the 10 [missionaries
be release
immediately](http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/02/17/haiti.border.arrests/index.html).
They will soon be flown back to the United States, leaving behind Laura Silsby
and Charisa Coulter. Sisby is the group's leader.

The already fractured public opinion in the blogosphere is sure to get more
intense over the surprise release of the 8 missionaries. There will also be
speculation over why 2 missionaries-Laura Silsby and Charisa Coulter are still
being held, beyond the official explanation that the judge wants to
investigate why the pair had traveled to Haiti before the devastating
earthquake last month. It seems that Haiti's children will once again be on
the spotlight.
