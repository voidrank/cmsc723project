At first, everyone thought it was a joke or just one more Twitter rumor. Soon,
netizens realised it was true and the shock made everyone act even more
hysterical with their funny tweets that Jordan and Morocco's requests to join
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have been welcomed and will be discussed.

The news of having Jordan in the GCC did not steal the spotlight because they
share borders, but to actually include Morocco, which is located on the other
side of the Arab World, prompted a lot of humor and questions.

The GCC is a political entity, set up in 1981, which brings together Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

The hash tag #GCC went on fire after the news of Morocco and Jordan requesting
to join the GCC.

UAE columnist and tweep Sultan AlQassemi (@SultanAlQassemi) was one of the
very first to tweet the news. He
[wrote](http://twitter.com/#!/SultanAlQassemi/status/68018910011731968):

> Now the Gulf Cooperation Council states have borders with Israel, Palestine
> & Syria.

Then, AlQassemi
[added](http://twitter.com/#!/SultanAlQassemi/status/68014311540391936):

> Basically the GCC is turning into a club for Arab monarchies. #Morocco
> #Jordan

Muna Abu Sulayman (@MunaAbuSulayman), a well known Saudi anchor who works for
_MBC_ broadcasting company,
[noted](http://twitter.com/#!/MunaAbuSulayman/status/68036147456118784):

> New GCC is about ensuring no one has power except Old GCC… Big lesson to

Another Saudi woman, Hatoon Al-Fasi, a famous woman rights activist and PhD
holder also tweeted her reaction to the news of having Morocco and Jordan as
members of the GCC, and her point of view was repeated in different ways by
several tweeps also. Al-Fasi (@HatoonALFASSI)
[wrote](http://twitter.com/#!/HatoonALFASSI/status/68024026202771456):

> GCC is transferring into the Council of Monarchies, Jordan and Morocco are

Ebtihal Mubarak (@EbtihalMubarak), a Saudi activist and Journalist based in
New York City, agreed with Al-Fasi in her
[tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/EbtihalMubarak/status/68044651973709824) saying:

> Is the new #GCC is a desperate attempt from rich Gulf states to protect the

Kuwaiti lawyer and political activist Obaid Al-Wasmi (@Dr_alwasmi)also
criticized the news
[writing](http://twitter.com/#!/Dr_alwasmi/status/68035257168957440) [ar]:

> الترحيب يإنضمام الأردن و المغرب لمنظمة مجلس التعاون يستوجب تغيير نظامها

Welcoming Jordan and Morocco to GCC should come with changing GCC legal system
from an international organization to an association for Royal Families,
because that is actually the real aim.

Young Saudi tweep Aalia Al-Faigh (@Aalia_F) touched another string in the case
[saying](http://twitter.com/#!/Aalia_F/status/68043646708092930):
