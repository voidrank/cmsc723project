San Francisco-based physician and [blogger](http://www.docgurley.com/) Dr. Jan
Gurley has visited Haiti twice since the January 12 earthquake to volunteer
her services. Her [second visit](http://www.docgurley.com/2010/11/04/haiti-
storms-cholera-and-you-time-to-thank-your-toilet/) coincided with the [cholera
outbreak](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/11/haiti-in-
the-time-of-cholera/) that has claimed hundreds of lives and caused thousands
more to be hospitalised since the first case appeared on October 19, 2010.
“Cholera is a lethal infection of hurricane proportions,”
[writes](http://www.docgurley.com/2010/11/04/haiti-storms-cholera-and-you-
time-to-thank-your-toilet/) Doc Gurley (as she's known in the blogosphere):

> You can die in as little as 3 hours, with your entire body’s amount of fluid

Doc Gurley looked around online for an instructional video on [oral
rehydration
therapy](http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/pharmacopoeia/ors/en/)
(ORT) that she could leave with her Haitian colleagues and patients. A
knowledge of ORT basics could save lives, as most deaths from cholera are in
fact caused by dehydration. Doc Gurley reminds her readers that even in Haiti,
video can be an effective tool for spreading information: “People there have
cell phones and texts, and everyone has an email address. Aid workers have
smart phones that can show videos, and people there, just like here, love to
gather ’round and watch the tiny screen.”

When her online searches yielded nothing but a single Hausa-language video and
a handful of others covertly advertising Gatorade-style electrolyte drinks,
Doc Gurley got a few friends together and made the video below. It's mostly
wordless, making it suitable for use in any country, and depicts how to make
oral rehydration salts “using only things that a person living in a sheet city
would have”, including PET water bottles and bottle caps:

> 4 caps sugar, 1 cap salt, 500ml clean water = life
