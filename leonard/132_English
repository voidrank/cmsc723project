Following the appalling confirmation that [virginity tests
](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/05/30/egypt.virginity.tests/index.html)were
conducted for female protesters who were detained during the Egyptian
revolution, rage took over not only Egyptian females but also males who
couldn't believe that those who fought for dignity and freedom had been
attacked in such a humiliating way.

When the [testimonies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCe1km7UFM) came out in
March 2011, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) denied the action.
However, the general who lately admitted that virginity test were conducted
justified that the female detainees were not ‘normal’ Egyptian girls, and that
SCAF conducted the tests to avoid sexual harassment accusations.

This video, from _Tahrir Diaries_ , features a testimony from one of the girls
tested:

The claim that the position taken to avoid sexual harassment accusations by
sexually and emotionally harassing peaceful female protesters was actually met
by a tornado of rage and disdain.

Confirming the fact that violating a woman's privacy is an act of harassment

In a [post that addresses the roots of sexual harassment in
Egypt](http://idindeed.blogspot.com/2011/06/hymen-obsession-inequality-
harassment.html?spref=tw), Ayman Ashour elaborates the objective of the
virginity tests from his point of view:

Hymens have always been a debatable subject in Egypt..the accusations and
action taken is not only a slap in the face of the Egyptian people's better
half, but also a setback for two of the revolution's principles – dignity and
freedom.
