On January 18 Global Voices will [launch the Technology for Transparency
Network](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2009/12/28/rising-voices-
launches-the-transparency-and-technology-network/), a collaborative research
mapping of internet projects that promote greater transparency, government
accountability, and civic engagement. This is the first in a series of posts
that will explore related issues through the eyes of bloggers worldwide. To
kick things off we look at how bloggers responded to [International Anti-
Corruption Day](http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/events/anti_corruption/), which
was signed into law in 2003 at the [United Nations Convention against
Corruption](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html) and takes
place every year on December 9th.

On _Space for Transparency_ , the official blog of [Transparency
International](http://www.transparency.org/), Georg Neumann looks back at the
state of anti-corruption activism for 2009:

> Increasingly, anti-corruption activists have been [in the line of
> attack](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2009/on_the_frontlines).
> Journalists writing on corruption in politics and society such as Sri
> Lanka’s Lasantha Wickramatunga earlier this year have given their lives.
> Activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina,
> [Burundi](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7993550.stm),
> [Guatemala](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/world/americas/22guatemala.html)
> or Zimbabwe [have faced threats or were being
> silenced](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2009/on_the_frontlines).
> Anti-Corruption Day stands for a day to remember, recognise and honour these
> brave and fearless people, who went to prison or lost their lives believing
> that through fighting corruption they will make the world a better place.

Neumann also notes that 2009 saw [the passing of a flawed review
mechanism](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2009/2009_11_13_review_mechanism_flawed)
which doesn't require member states to seek input from independent NGO's based
in their countries. In a five-minute YouTube video Peter Eigen, the founder of
Transparency International, describes the important role of civil society in
fighting corruption and improving governance:

But it wasn't all bad news in 2009, writes Neumann. There are now [40 Advocacy
and Legal Advice Centers](http://www.transparency.org/alac) worldwide
providing legal advice to victims of corruption. Also, online [social media
has proven itself a powerful tool in promoting transparency and fighting
against
corruption](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2009/your_say_on_corruption).
In India, for example, J. N. Jayashree started a
[wiki](http://fightcorruption.wikidot.com/) to [protect her husband whose
safety was threatened](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/world/asia/02iht-
india.1.6443659.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=India%20whistleblower&st=cse) as a result
of his whistle-blowing activities. In Morocco an anonymous anti-corruption
activist [has begun posting videos to YouTube of police officers accepting
bribes](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1212915920071114).

On Global Voices a number of posts commemorated Anti-Corruption Day last
month. Bhumika Ghimire
[notes](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/09/corruption-impeding-
development-in-nepal/) that Nepal was
[ranked](http://www.nepalnews.com/main/index.php/news-
archive/2-political/2459-nepal-ranks-143rd-in-anti-corruption-scale.htm) by
Transparency International as one of the world's most corrupt countries.
Linking to other Nepalese bloggers, Bhumika's article shows how corruption in
Nepal affects [the economy](http://www.groundreport.com/World/Oil-price-goes-
up-in-Nepal/2911979), [governance](http://drdulal.blogspot.com/2009/11/crime-
corruption-edging-out-politics.html), [public
works](http://www.youtube.com/v/HteZP1ucPMI&hl=en_US&fs=1&), and [even
marriage](http://krishnabhusalkawasoti.blogspot.com/2009/11/corruption-in-
nepal-root-prevalance-and.html).

In Brazil [violence broke out on Anti-Corruption Day between police and
protesters](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/12/brazil-police-violence-
on-national-anti-corruption-day/):

> Protesters have been demanding the impeachment of the Governor of the
> Federal District, Jose Roberto Arruda, and his deputy, Paulo Octavio, in
> addition to a thorough investigation into all parties cited in the bribery
> scandal that led to a police operation codenamed Pandora Box. According to
> the investigation, Governor Arruda is the possible head of a R$ 600,000
> (approximately $340,000) per month bribery scheme that has benefited allies
> among district members of parliament, businessmen and government officials.

But there is also reason for optimism in Brazil when it comes to transparency
and open governance, as Paula Goés explained a week before Anti-Corruption
Day:

> The first Transparência [Transparency] Hackday, “two days for hacking into
> Brazilian politics”, was launched in São Paulo at the beginning of October,
> and the last camp took place this week, [on December 1st and 2nd, in the
> capital Brasília](http://blog.esfera.mobi/thackday-brasilia/) [pt].
> Organized by journalists [Daniela Silva](http://twitter.com/danielabsilva)
> and [Pedro Markun](http://blog.markun.com.br/) [both pt], the event has free
> entry and is an opportunity for software developers, journalists and
> researchers to gather together to find ways to “scrape” data from official
> websites and create applications that bring transparency and participation
> to the political processes.

Global Voices editors also point readers to a number of posts around the
blogosphere related to transparency, corruption, and government
accountability. Peter Marton looks at the [harmful role of corruption in
rebuilding
Afghanistan](http://statefailure.blogspot.com/2009/11/corruptioncorruptioncorruptioncorruptio.html).
In Ukraine, meanwhile, Petro
[congratulates](http://petrosjotter.blogspot.com/2009/12/kabul-did-it-why-
cant-kyiv.html) the residents of Kabul for sentencing their mayor to four
years of prison for corruption and imagines how quickly Kyiv's prisons would
fill up if the same laws were enforced in his country. Writing in
Registan.net, Alexander Visotzky looks at the [corruption charges against
Mukhtar Dzhakishev](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2719309520090527) for
the illegal sale of Uranium and
[concludes](http://www.registan.net/index.php/2009/12/24/the-plot-sickens/),
“The fight against corruption in Kazakhstan is apparently much more of a
political game than an attempt to root out corruption.” Writing from Japan,
Scilla Alecci [points to](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/09/japan-
worst-corruption-cases-of-2009/) Transparency International's [Ten Worst
Corruption Cases of 2009 in
Japan](http://www.ti-j.org/corrupt/09/10worstcorruptionsof2009.pdf). Finally,
writing from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, “Gil the Jenius” [asks for
tougher punishments against public officials convicted of
corruption](http://gilthejenius.blogspot.com/2010/01/dollar-per-day.html).

Looking back on anti-corruption activism in 2009 we see that an entrenched
culture of corruption is still pervasive worldwide. But we also see a growing
online discussion about what can be done to curb corruption, promote
transparency, and increase civic engagement. In future posts we'll look more
specifically at online discussions and internet-based projects to promote
transparency and fight against corruption in Nigeria and China.
