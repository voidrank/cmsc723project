Moldova’s capital [Chisinau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chişinău) is set to
witness another democratic exercise this Sunday, June 19, when the second and
final round of the local election will decide whether the city will have a
[liberal](http://www.dorinchirtoaca.md/) or a
[communist](http://dodon.md/main) mayor.

A group of bloggers has launched the [+1 Vote](http://plus1vot.com/about.html)
online campaign to mobilize young people to go out and vote, regardless of
their choice.

The bloggers are planning to do a mobilization dance on Sunday in Chisinau's
National Square. They have a
[tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWhtcU4-xAM&feature=youtu.be), they have
the [moves](http://voxreport.md/2011/06/15/%C8%99ocant-exclusiv-chiaramu-
inva%C8%9Bam-pa%C8%99ii-de-dans-1-vot-vezi-aici-video/) and with their bodies
they will dance and write +1 Vote. To make sure it goes well, on Thursday,
June 16, they held a rehearsal and were joined by many young people, including
a newlywed couple ([photo](http://plus1vot.com/foto.html) and
[video](http://plus1vot.com/video.html)).

Bloggers have launched +1 Vote, an online mobilisation campaign

Launched on June 15, the +1 Vote campaign has seen a number of Facebook users
change their profile photos to the [+1 Vote
logo](http://plus1vot.com/index.html) and the campaign's [Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=130531467027351) has already
gathered more than 300 potential attendees.

The campaign has been [largely featured](http://jurnal.md/ro/news/repeti-ia-
generala-a-dansului-1-vot-foto-video-206649/) in the [mainstream
media](http://www.inprofunzime.md/stiri/politic/1-la-vot-repetitie-generala-
in-pman-pentru-alegerile-locale-din.html) and has generated lively discussions
in the blogosphere.

Katya Poclitari
[addresses](http://vox.publika.md/social/1-repetitie-33871.html) [ro] her
fellow citizens:

> Each of us matters. Each vote matters and that +1 Vote will be the decisive
> one and will bring the change to us living in Chisinau – the people of this
> beautiful, rich and, hopefully, happy country.
>
> PS: THE MOST IMPORTANT, before or after the +1 Vote dance, do not forget to
> go and vote.

Though the organisers have declared the campaign to be neutral, the blue
colour used in the logo is the electoral colour of the liberal party. Eugeniu
Luchianiuc [does not
agree](http://luchianiuc.com/blog/2011/06/14/daca-e-%E2%80%9Dplus-
unu%E2%80%9D-atunci-%E2%80%9D1%E2%80%9D-sa-fie/) [ro] to this and has made his
own +1 Vote logo: red (communist party) and blue (liberal party), in order to
be truly neutral:

> I promote the idea that you have to go and vote. The choice is yours, that
> is why there are choices.

Nata Albot [is going to join](http://voxreport.md/2011/06/15/1-la-vot/) [ro]
the +1 Vote campaign and here is why:

> It is of interest to me, first of all because I will continue living in
> Chisinau; it interests me as an experiment to test the power of the internet
> and most of all because it harms no one.

“Let’s do it, CHIŞINĂU,” [writes](http://voxreport.md/2011/06/15/lets-do-it-
chisinau/) [ro] Andrei Fornea:

> I believe in us more than never. Come on, mobilization!

Vadim Zgherea [is taking part](http://voxreport.md/2011/06/14/1-pentru-
chisinau/) [ro] in the campaign, even though he has not yet reached the voting
age:

> I do not vote, I do not yet have the right age. I do not intend to justify
> myself, I just want to make a gesture. I want to encourage people to VOTE.

Alexandru Gurdila has reached the age allowing him to vote, but he [chooses
not to vote](http://voxreport.md/2011/06/13/1-1-tu-decizi/) [ro]. Still, he
has joined the campaign:

> I know that I have made a fuss about not voting for the mayor. I will keep
> not voting. But this does not mean that you have to be like me.

Anna Antonoff has [made her choice](http://vox.publika.md/politica/moldova-
iar-alege-33231.html) [ro]:

> I am going to vote!!!  
>  Are you?
