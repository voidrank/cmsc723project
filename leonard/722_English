Kazuo Ohno, legendary performer and one of the founding fathers of _Butoh_ ,
passed away on June 1st at the age of 103. A quote from his bio provided by
the [Kazuo Ohno Dance
Studio](http://www.kazuoohnodancestudio.com/english/kazuo/):

> When he dances, he vitalizes himself. An ordinary old man becomes a somebody
> who gives power to others. People love to encounter Kazuo because of that.
> He lives long, he moves people deeply. Kazuo Ohno is an artist who has
> enlarged human potential.

[Butoh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butoh) is an avant-garde dance form that
originated in post WWII Japan, characterized by white body paint and
conceptual, tortured movements.

This is a clip from “[Beauty and
Power](http://www.kazuoohnodancestudio.com/japanese/product/p10001.html)”
called “Admiring La Argentina”. Directed by fellow Butoh founder [Tatsumi
Hijikata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsumi_Hijikata) and premiered in
1977, the piece is a tribute to the Spanish dancer Antonia Mercé (known as “La
Argentina”), whom Ohno saw on stage in 1929 when he was 22.

Many reflected on the times they had seen Ohno perform and how it impacted
them. Michiko Murayama at the [True Colors
blog](http://aakaaza.blogspot.com/2010/06/blog-post_06.html), on the first
time she saw La Argentina, several decades ago:

>
> 観客との見えないエネルギーの交換を、確信犯的に遊ぶがごとき完璧に自由な魂と肉体を目の当たりにして，痛快で笑いをこらえきれませんでした。深刻さなどとは縁遠く、果てしなく、宇宙へひろがり一体化する肉体と魂がとても自由に感じられたのでした。  
>  美しくて、滑稽で、純で、潔くて、愛に溢れている、その存在。
>
> 当時新しいダンスの地平を求めて仲間と作品作りに日夜没頭していた日々…変化を求める時に、人はどうしても怖れや不安が出てきて当たり前なのですね。
> そんな時この舞台に遭遇した私たちは、限りない勇気とエネルギーをもらい、意気揚々と劇場を後にしたのを覚えています。

He had a completely liberated soul and body on hand to exchange unseen energy
with the audience, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Watching him play
so masterfully with the interaction was absolutely glorious. The fusion of
body and soul seemed to stretch endlessly to space, untouched by any kind of
seriousness, and it felt so free.
