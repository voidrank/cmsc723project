showcasing the stories of victims of the violence in Eastern Congo coordinated
and launched by [Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières
(MSF)](http://doctorswithoutborders.org/  "Doctors Without Borders").

[Xeni Jardin of Boing Boing ](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/02/doctors-
without-bord.html)asked Pete Masters of MSF for some more information on the
project and then posted his reply:

A year ago [we wrote about the
project](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/15/dr-congo-video-call-for-
action/) “Condition: Critical” and their call for action:

> A campaign by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) to raise
> awareness on the stark state of the DRC will start on November 20th. The
> Condition:Critical project will collect voices from the war in Eastern DRC,
> starting off with a documentary to be published on the launch date. The

> born and raised during the war, who perceives his future as a bleak path
> leading only unto death.

This is the same story that begins this next video telling the story of the
war in the Congo and how it is affecting the people who live there. It also
tells of the work MSF are doing in the area, trying to save as many people as
they possibly can:

The [following story](http://blip.tv/file/2901590) has the pictures drawn by a
former child soldier who tells of how he was kidnapped as a child and forced
to commit terrible acts:

[Francoise ](http://blip.tv/file/2888852)was locked in her home when it was
set on fire. She was gravely burned and lost both children due to that event:
one died inside the burning house, the other in the hospital. Even through her
physical pain, she confesses that the hardest pain to deal with is the one in
her heart.

[Bahati ](http://www.vimeo.com/7869398)tells how he saw his wife, mother,
father and brothers die in the war and then he fled to a refugee camp, where
they are still afraid due to the insecurity there. Since he is alone, he has
to work to eat, and he teaches anyone who asks him how to be a lumberjack, so
they don't starve to death, and hoping they in turn will also help anyone else
in need.

[Mishoka's](http://www.vimeo.com/7868563) brother was killed, and he was left
to flee with his own family as well as his brother's widow and young daughter.
He fled with all his village, carrying only a mat and a blanket, and now has
to provide for all his extended family in a war situation.

You can [visit Condition: Critical and leave a message of
support](http://www.condition-critical.org/map/) to the People of Eastern
Congo by clicking on the map filled with green squares and leaving your own.
MSF will then share some of the messages with the people in Eastern Congo. To
