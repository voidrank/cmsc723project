More than 50 people were killed after tropical storm “Ondoy” (International
Name: Ketsana) battered Metro Manila and nearby provinces. The storm triggered
the [worst flooding in the country](http://ph.politicalarena.com/presidential-
elections/news/51-dead-280-000-displaced-by-ondoy) in the past 40 years
displacing 280,000 people in Manila and five other provinces, with more than
41,000 people in 92 evacuation centers. As of this writing, [1.2 million
residents](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090927-227141/12M-still-
without-power) are still without power supply in the urban capital of the
Philippines.

Social media sites were maximized not just to share information about the
storm but also to report rescue efforts and emergency cases in disaster-struck
areas. Joey Alarilla [observes](http://joeyalarilla.com/filipinos-turn-to-
twitter-as-storm-ondoy-floods-metro-manila/) how the internet was used by
Filipino netizens as the storm hits Metro Manila

The Rescue Info Hub Central features a [spreadsheet
document](http://spreadsheets.google.com/lv?key=tohu9kthNU6anlf21Low08g&toomany=true)
that has a list of addresses of flood victims who need to be rescued. A google
map page was also created to monitor the flooded areas in Metro Manila and to
direct authorities to villages where flood victims need assistance.

Filipinos also used Twitter and [Plurk](http://www.plurk.com/psearch#q=ondoy)
to monitor updates about the storm, In fact,
[“Ondoy”](http://twitter.com/#search?q=Ondoy%20OR%20%23ondoy) and
[“NDCC”](http://twitter.com/#search?q=NDCC) (the government’s National
Disaster Coordinating Council) became top-trending topics on Twitter last
Saturday. A sample of Twitter posts:
