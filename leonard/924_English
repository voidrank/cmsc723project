Bloggers discuss what the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan,
which [came into force](http://eng.gazeta.kz/art.asp?aid=141615) on January 1,
2010, would give Kazakhstan. A trade bloc of three countries is viewed by the
governments as the first step towards deeper integration into the Eurasian
Economic Union.

Some experts believe this is the right decision for the Kazakh authorities,
especially in view of looming Chinese economic influence. Skeptics say the
protectionism in favor of Russian goods and services would raise prices for
the more competitive goods and services from the third countries. Many see
this step as a death sentence to the local manufacturers, while others say
there are no serious manufacturing businesses to kill here.

_Grunge Amir_
[considers](http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/872882/post116618981/) the
Customs Union as a conspiracy against Kazakhstan [ru]:

> Kazakhstan is sold out to Russia – it's a fact. 82 per cent of the customs
> tariffs will remain unchanged in Russia, 75 per cent of the tariffs stay the
> same in Belarus, and only 45 per cent will be kept unamended in Kazakhstan.

_Megakhuimyak_ [is more
optimistic](http://megakhuimyak.livejournal.com/759701.html) [ru]:

> There is one detail in the Customs Union – Kazakhstan has got the lowest
> taxes among three countries. So, it is quite possible that part of the
> businesses will move here, especially from Belarus.

_Thousand-Pa_ [notes](http://thousand-pa.livejournal.com/599276.html) the
first signs of discord within the Union [ru]:

> How do you like that? The newborn Customs Union is already showing the
> symptoms of self-destruction. Russia to Belarus – “No money, no oil”.
> Belarus to Russia – “No oil, no transit of natural gas”. There was so much
> ado about this Union…

Meanwhile, _Epolet_ reads official statistics and
[notes](http://epolet.livejournal.com/165059.html) [ru]:

> Propaganda says that average salary in Kazakhstan has grown 535,5 times

But, _torrnado_ [adds](http://www.torrnado.us/?p=1623), some people take much
more from this curve than the others [ru]:

> The fortune of only one former Kazakhstani official makes up nearly 3 per
> cent of the country's GDP. Oligarchs with the “Soviet” roots occupy the
> leading positions in the top 300 most wealthy Swiss citizens. Victor
> Khrapunov, former mayor of Almaty currently living in Geneva, is also there
> with the fortune amounted to 300-400 million francs.

Needless to say, this person has never had any business and spent all his life
on public service.
