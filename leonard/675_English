Last week [Friends of the Earth Europe](http://www.foeeurope.org/) and
Mozambican NGO [Justiça Ambiental](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Justica-
Ambiental/128707627163380?v=info) [Environmental Justice, pt] **** furiously
denounced an accord between Brazil, the European Union and Mozambique to
promote biofuels production in Mozambique.

The agreement would increase technical cooperation to promote biofuel
production in Mozambique. Currently Mozambican sugarcane ethanol imports to
the EU would be subject to very low tariffs in comparison with Brazilian
ethanol, which the EU will continue to tax.

Brazilian companies would profit from increased emphasis on the sector and
assistance, as some are looking to expand their operations in Mozambique.
[According to _Reporter
Brasil_](http://www.reporterbrasil.org.br/agrocombustiveis/exibe.php?id=111)
[pt] at the end of last year, at least two major Brazilian companies had land
use agreements to expand sugarcane production in Mozambique, and were looking
for financing to actually produce ethanol in the country.

Officials are saying that African production would have to meet European
environmental standards and undergo feasibility studies.

Yet even some of the first ethanol projects in Mozambique have been fraught
with social and environmental concerns (see recent [Global Voices coverage of
one case](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/06/mozambique-demise-of-a-
massive-biofuels-project/)). Justiça Ambiental said in a [press release last
week](http://www.foeeurope.org/press/2010/Jul14_EU_Brazil_biofuels_deal_land_grabbing_charter.html)

> The expansion of biofuels in our country is transforming natural forest and
> vegetation into fuel crops, is taking away fertile farmland from communities
> growing food, and creating poor working conditions and conflicts with local
> people over land ownership. We want real investment in agriculture that
> allows us to produce food and not fuel for foreign cars.

In response [the government news service
AIM](http://allafrica.com/stories/201007161071.html) called Friends of the
Earth's statement “woefully ignorant”, also attacked JA, saying there is no
evidence to suggest that biofuels production has hurt food production.

Yet in addition to Friends of the Earth's own report (“[The Jatropha
Trap](http://www.foei.org/en/resources/publications/pdfs-members/2010/the-
jatropha-trap-the-realities-of-farming-jatropha-in-mozambique)“), another
study from International Institute of Economics and Development in the UK
(“[Biofuels, land access and rural livelihoods in
Mozambique](http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=12563IIED)“) has urged
caution in recent weeks in relation to biofuels expansion in Mozambique.

The trilateral agreement is just one indicator of the strength of what
Brazilian commentators have called President Lula's “ethanol diplomacy”.
[Leandro Freitas Couto writes](http://mundorama.net/2010/07/16/a-diplomacia-
do-etanol-por-leandro-freitas-couto/) [pt]

> Na recente visita do presidente Lula a seis países africanos (Cabo Verde,
> Guiné Equatorial, Quênia, Tanzânia e África do Sul) os biocombustíveis, o
> etanol mais especificamente, tiveram destaque na agenda. […] O Brasil também
> já dispõe de um acordo com os Estados Unidos sobre o tema, assinado ainda

In his recent visit to six African countries (Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea,
Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa) President Lula, biofuels, specifically
ethanol, were high on the agenda. […] Brazil already has an accord with the
United States in the area, signed during the Bush government. It foresees
triangular technical cooperation, along the lines of the accord just signed
between the European Union and Mozambique […]

Thus ethanol diplomacy has been consolidated in the last moments of foreign
policy practice of President Lula. The gradual, but unstoppable, substitution
of fossil fuels and the growing attention to climate issues will only
strengthen this agenda in the future, which will help strengthen the presence
of Brazil on the world stage […] With this scenario, whatever the electoral
results this October, the continuity of this line of foreign policy is
guaranteed for coming years.

Brazilian activists like the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) Alagoas have
denounced this form of “diplomacy” during recent years. In a 2009 visit to
Maputo for a conference on agrofuels (the word used to avoid the positive
connotations of “bio”), [CPT Alagoas
said](http://cptalagoas.blogspot.com/2009/09/agrocombustiveis-global-que-tipo-
de.html) [pt]

Historically, sugarcane ethanol activity in Brazil has generated profound
disrespect for human rights and has caused grave environmental damage. In
recent years, the indiscriminate expansion of sugarcane production for ethanol
– with the objective of fulfilling expectations of the international market –
has broadening the super-exploitation of sugarcane wage laborers and has
increased the amount of work analogous to slavery. […]

Positioning Brazil as a key country in the production of renewable energy is
to make a superficial or results-oriented reading, it is to erase the recent
past and to create a false impression that all of the impacts (economic,
social and environmental) were overcome and that the ethanol produced in
Brazil is a clean fuel. [..]

We cannot permit this model of exploitation to be exported to Africa, nor to
any other country in the world.

The Mozambican blogsphere has yet to comment at any length on the trilateral
accord. Yet the issue of ethanol has received some comment in the past,
including from NGOs and social movements. The National Farmers Union (União
Nacional de Camponeses, UNAC) recently posted an interview, [Ismael Ossemane,
says](http://www.unac.org.mz/spip.php?article44) [pt]

> Agora com o etanol e os agrocombustíveis começa uma maior busca por terra em
> Moçambique e a tendência é esta força por em prova a lei de terras. Então
> nos encontramos nesta situação: ainda há terras para os camponeses por causa
> do estágio de desenvolvimento do país, mas através da forma como começam a
> entrar as empresas, percebemos que, se hoje lutamos para defender a terra
> que temos, em breve começaremos a lutar para ter terra.

Now with ethanol and agrofuels, a greater demand for land in Mozambique
commences and the trend is that this is testing the Land Law. So we find
ourselves in this situation: there is still land for small farmers due to the
stage of development in the country, but with the way companies are starting
to come in, we can see that if today we are fighting to defend the land we
have, soon we will begin to fight to have land at all.

It bears stating that the ethanol in question appears to be for the export
market and likely will not solve Mozambique's own dependence on imported oil.
In fact, the announcement of this accord came as gasoline retailers were
threatening to raise prices and potentially fuel unrest in Maputo like that
seen in February 2008 ([see Global Voices
coverage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/02/06/mozambique-a-riot-
organized-through-sms-and-reported-by-bloggers/).)
