Syria is the latest country to join the wave of erupting protests across the
Middle East. While previous calls for protests on 5 February failed, a renewed
call to take to the streets on 15 March managed to bring several hundred
people to the streets in multiple cities including the capital, Damascus, and
Aleppo. While the numbers might be small, this constitutes a very important
precedent in Syria where anti-government protests are unheard of, and any sign
of dissent is squashed with an iron fist.

On 16 March, around 150 [protested in front of the Ministry of
Interior](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/17/syria-protests-for-
release-of-political-prisoners-38-detained/) demanding the release of
prisoners of conscience, whose families also took part in the protests. The
protesters were violently dispersed and around 38 people were
[arrested](http://www.rttnews.com/Content/MarketSensitiveNews.aspx?Id=1577425&SM=1).

The caption reads: '15 March 2011. Free Syria. 48 years of injustice and
dictatorship.’

Today, [larger protests have occurred](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-
east-12791738) across the country. The largest thus far occurred in Dara'a,
100Km(60 Miles) south of the capital Damascus. Deadly force has been used
against protesters and reports say that 6 people have been and around 50 are
injured.

Syrian blogger @Okbah
[reports](https://twitter.com/okbah/status/48803686994030592) on Twitter:

> مصدر دكتور في مستشفى درعا يؤكد لمحمد العبد الله وصول ستة قتلى للمستشفى
> وخمسين جريحا. والصور قريبا[#Syria](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Syria
> "#Syria") [#Daraa](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Daraa "#Daraa")

A doctor in Dara'a Hospital confirms to Mohammad Al Abdallah that six people
have arrived dead and 50 wounded. Photos soon.

The following video shows the protest in Dara'a, in which people are chanting
“The protector is the thief.”  

@Okbah [adds](https://twitter.com/okbah/status/48790690112610306):

> عشائر درعا تهدد بحرق كل مقار الأمن والجيش في المدينة ان لم يحاسب الرئيس قتلة
> أبنائها اليوم [#Syria](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Syria "#Syria")

The tribes in Dara'a threaten to burn all the headquarters of the army and
security forces in the city if the president doesn't hold accountable those
who killed the their sons today.

A Syrian activist who goes by the nickname Malath Aumran
[confirms](https://twitter.com/MalathAumran/status/48795459799621632)
destruction is already in process:

From the US, Syrian activist Ammar Abdulhamid
[said](https://twitter.com/#!/Tharwacolamus/status/48736845747589120):

The video below shows fire engines being used to spray protesters with water:

A [Syrian Revolution](https://www.facebook.com/Syrian.Revolution) page on
Facebook is reporting that several helicopters have been spotted in the skies
of Dara'a, and according to them the city is under security lock down and
thousands of army forces are deployed. Also according to the page, 6 security
forces cars have been burned, and the authorities are trying to hide the
bodies of those who were killed in the crackdown.

This image shows a helicopter landing at Daraa's municipal stadium

It's common practice for the security and army forces also to break into
hospitals and force doctors to forge the cause of death on death certificates
to make the documents say that those who were killed died in traffic
accidents.

We will continue reporting on this story as updates become available.
