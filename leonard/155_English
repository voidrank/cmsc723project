After the release of Justin Bieber's silver screen debut, ‘[Never Say
Never](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Never_%28Justin_Bieber_song%29)‘,
a movie/documentary of his trials and tribulations, his ‘Beliebers’ here in
Brunei have attempted in full force to get his attention because Brunei is not
one of his concert stopovers in Southeast Asia.

News of his sold out concerts in neighboring cities, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur
and Jakarta, spurred his fans in Brunei to create the
[#Bruneineedsbeiber](http://twitter.com/#!/search/bruneineedsbieber) hashtag
and local fans flooded the hashtag #Brunei every minute to get
[@justinbieber](http://twitter.com/#!/justinbieber)‘s attention.

‘Brunei Beliebers’ even opened a [twitition](http://twitition.com/jtl4g) to
help get the Canadian star to come to Brunei. To date they have 366
signatures.

Local blogger @marul69 of
[_geekinwhite.com_](http://www.geekinwhite.com/post/4555976467/justin-bieber-
never-say-never-all-this-while) was never a ‘belieber’ and ‘is still not a
bieber fan’ but after watching ‘Never Say Never’, he mentioned,

> After watching this movie, I have to admit his success is no fluke, not
> manufactured or because of his looks entirely. He has real talent from a
> very young age. The type of talent one is born with.
>
> I’m in no way Bieber-ized. His songs are catchy no doubt, but it’s nothing I
> wanna listen to daily. All I am saying is that I respect his determination,
> his never say never attitude, the hard work he has put into it and the
> sacrifies he had made to be where he is. And when you’re 16 years old and
> you sold out Madison Square Garden in 22 minutes, that is just sick!

Brunei's twitter celebrity
[@BruneiTweet](http://twitter.com/#!/search/bruneitweet) sent out [his first
tweet ](http://projekbrunei.com/my-first-tweet-to-jb.html)to [@justinbieber
](http://twitter.com/#!/justinbieber)after watching ‘Never Say Never’ film and
mentioned that he watched it for social media researching purposes.

Another local blogger
[@Bruneiankidsays](http://twitter.com/#!/search/bruneiankidsays) in his blog
[‘memoirs of a Bruneian
Kid’](http://bruneiankidsays.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/brunei-engulfed-in-the-
bieberfever/) has nothing but praises for the 17 year old.

> think he’s a gifted singer no matter what the future lies for him. There’s
> just something about him

Some ‘Brunei Beliebers’ has even gone to the extent of making
[videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V2u9ZTnWfc) and
[posting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMkESImCpzM) it on YouTube to
convince Bieber to come to Brunei. Meanwhile, local talent Aziz Harun,
[@jambul212 ](http://twitter.com/#!/search/jambul212)
[records](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6ha57yQ_Q) his version of Bieber
hit song, ‘Baby.’

But after all these attempts, ‘Brunei Beliebers’ are still frustrated because
[@justinbieber](http://twitter.com/#!/justinbieber) has yet to reply to any of
the tweets from Brunei.
