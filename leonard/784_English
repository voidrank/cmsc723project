Soon after the final vote was cast in the April 4th municipal and departmental
elections and the official results began pouring in, many bloggers started to
provide their analysis and interpretation of the results. On that day,
Bolivians would set out to elect local mayors and members of the city council
in 327 municipalities, as well as governors and departmental assembly members
in the 9 departments.

After winning re-election in December 2009, President Evo Morales and his
party [Movement Towards
Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Socialism_%28Bolivia%29)
(MAS for its initials in Spanish) sought to consolidate power by maintaining
those regions in which they traditionally had strong support, but also to [put
forth “invited” candidates](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/10/bolivia-
ex-beauty-queen-named-candidate-for-governor-of-beni/) in opposition regions
that may provide them with different results from previous losses.

Mario Durán of the blog _Palabras Libres [es]_ notes that the MAS won 6 of 9
governor seats, but only the mayorship of 2 of the 9 departmental capitals.
This he notes, [leaves the victory with a “taste of
ash.”](http://bolivianueva.blogspot.com/2010/04/bolivia-una-victoria-con-
sabor-ceniza.html) Duran's brother, Jaime, [also chimes in with some questions
and answers about the
results](http://ecopold.blogspot.com/2010/04/domingo-4-de-abril-que-
paso.html):

What do these results mean? Can we talk about a defeat for the MAS?

As always, there is not only one answer for these questions. It is a defeat
because they did not meet expectations. To lose 3 mayorships in the West
(traditionally strong support for MAS) is not good news. It is not a defeat
because at the mid-level (departmental governments) they are under control of
the blue party (MAS) and at that level the autonomies are constructed. Even
though it must be noted that in the departments in which the hydrocarbon
wealth can be found, they are not under the control of the government party.
This will create problems and will soon be seen.

Blogger Pablo Andrés Rivero of _Purple Fire [es]_ [writes
that](http://payodreamer.blogspot.com/2010/04/la-sole-chapeton-deconstruyendo-
un.html), “it is clear that the MAS-IPSP is the outright winner, but… there
are many ‘buts'”

One of these “buts” took place in the city of La Paz, which is also the seat
of government and where the MAS has enjoyed considerable support. However, its
mayoral candidate Elizabeth Salguero, who had been leading in the polls, was
defeated by Luis Revilla from the party Without Fear Movement (MSM for its
initials in Spanish). It was this result that attracted the most attention in
the Bolivian blogosphere, as many bloggers provided their thoughts on why the
MAS lost in La Paz and what this means for the party and its party chief for
the future.

[Juan del Granado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Del_Granado), who founded
the MSM, had been mayor of La Paz for a decade before deciding not to run for
a 3rd term in the 2010 elections. As a former human-rights lawyer, del Granado
had successfully prosecuted the first Latin American dictator in the courts
when he placed [Luis García
Meza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Garc%C3%ADa_Meza_Tejada) behind bars
in the mid 1990s.

During his 2nd term in office, the MSM became allies with the MAS party.
However, for the 2010 elections, the MSM chose to put forth its own candidate,
rather than support Salguero in the municipal elections. This led to a war of
words from President Morales and many of his supporters, which included
threats of placing del Granado into the Chonchocoro maximum security prison
and warnings that the central government would not work with elected leaders
from opposition party. This rhetoric was something which the bloggers and
evidently the voters noted, as Revilla was elected. Some voters like [Alberto
Canedo (@betocomics)](http://twitpic.com/1d89nb) captured the image of their
vote for Revilla in [this Twitpic photo](http://twitpic.com/1d89nb), as well
as [Patricio Javier Vera (@patojv)](http://twitpic.com/1d82xd):

Daniela Otero of the blog _Dejando Huella [es]_
[writes](http://damasyescuderos.blogspot.com/2010/04/el-costo-de-las-malas-
decisiones.html):

The dirty war set upon the Without Fear Movement, one of the most important
allies in the process of change in the Occident, was interpreted by the
citizenry as a succession of acts of disloyalty and arbitrariness.

Blogger and political scientist Miguel Centellas of _Pronto*_ [adds that there
was a bit of hypocrisy in these
accusations](http://www.mcentellas.com/archives/2010/04/a-very-preliminary-
view-of-early-bolivian-election-projections-4.html):

Richard Sánchez of the digital magazine _La Mala Palabra [es]_ was especially
tough on the MAS and clearly stated his intention to not vote for Salguero,
and encouraged his readers to refrain from casting a ballot for the MAS
candidate. He writes the following, 3 days prior to the elections, [why people
should not vote for the
MAS](http://revistalamalapalabra.blogspot.com/2010/04/por-que-no-votar-por-el-
mas-en-la-paz.html):

> Porque ese empleado a quien le dimos pega en Palacio por segunda vez, ahora
> amenaza. Se da el lujo de amenazar diciendo que no trabajará con alcaldes o
> gobernadores que ganen y que no sean del MAS. ¿No se da cuenta que es
> presidente de TODOS los bolivianos, le guste o no? Un embajador gringo
> también nos amenazó hace tiempo para que no votemos por Evo y todos votamos
> por Evo. Ahora Evo cae en las mismas amenazas. LMP y ninguno tiene ni debe
> ser amenazado. NO VOTES POR EL MAS CARAJO.

Because that employee (President Morales) who we placed in the Palace for the
second time, is now giving threats. He gives himself the luxury of giving
threats saying that he will not work with mayors or governors who win and who
are not from the MAS. Does he not realize that he is the President of ALL
Bolivians, whether he likes it or not? A U.S. ambassador also warned us awhile
ago (1997) to not vote for Evo and then we all voted for Evo. Now Evo is
falling into giving the same threats. LMP (La Mala Palabra) and no one else
should be threatened. DON'T VOTE FOR MAS, DAMMIT.

Even though del Granado did not participate in the local elections as a
candidate, many have been calling him one of the day's winners, partly due to
the errors committed by Morales and the MAS party. Otero [summarizes this
[es]](http://damasyescuderos.blogspot.com/2010/04/el-costo-de-las-malas-
decisiones.html):

> Quizá, la lección más importante de estas elecciones es que los errores
> políticos siempre pasan altas facturas y que los que se cometieron en el
> caso específico de La Paz sólo contribuyeron al surgimiento de una nueva
> fuerza política nacional: el Movimiento Sin Miedo.

Maybe, the most important lesson in these elections is that the political
errors always come with consequences and those that committed these errors in
La Paz cause the rise of a new national political force: the Without Fear
Movement.

Jaime Durán, writes that at the head of this new political force is del
Granado, and it is [a different kind of opposition
[es]](http://ecopold.blogspot.com/2010/04/domingo-4-de-abril-que-paso.html),
because it is also an left-wing opposition, as opposed to the traditional
right-wing opposition to the MAS. Victories by the MSM also were recorded in
the city of Oruro, another traditional MAS stronghold, and strong finishes in
other parts of the country.

At the victory press conference appearing with the mayor-elect Revilla, MSM
supporters greeted del Granado with calls for him to run for President in
2014. Despite the springboard to the national scene based on these results,
del Granado said that “2014 is still very far away.”
