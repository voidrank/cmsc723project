The majority of trending discussions this week in Poland evolves around last
Saturday's crash of the Polish plane in Russia. [One of the most popular
discussions](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-naszej-
klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) [PL] on _Wykop_ , a Polish bookmarking engine, is
the new gifting option that _Nasza-Klasa_ social network has introduced: black
ribbons.

A screenshot example, [originally posted on
Yfrog](http://yfrog.com/6h51469916j), has had nearly 80,000 views already:

"Congratulations to Nasza-Klasa on their ambitions"

_Nasza-Klasa_ has also created an [account](http://nasza-
klasa.pl/#informacje_o_katastrofie_w_smolensku) dedicated to updates related
to the tragedy [PL]:

![channelnk](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

"Information about the catastrophe in Smolensk"

Both actions have generated various reactions from the public. Most reactions
are negative.

_Mazaq_ ‘s [reaction](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-
naszej-klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) is harsh [PL]:

> Police should take care of this and close this foolish portal.

_TomaszMazowiecki_ [refers](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-
lotnicza-naszej-klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) to the commercial nature of these
changes [PL]:

> Just to earn money, regardless of the means, […] no matter how… just to earn
> money, a big chunk of it.

_Szykago_ also [criticises](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-
lotnicza-naszej-klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) the idea [PL]:

> I saw it earlier. Administrators of _nasza-klasa_ have gone too far. And
> those presents with a black ribbon – a disgrace. Just to earn money on
> something that can be described as a national tragedy. I hope they will pay
> for it. It's simply a joke.

_GrubyKociol_ [states](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-
naszej-klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) [PL]:

> Administrators went too far, but users are not any better. A MILLION of
> ribbons, candles. Why the f*** do you need it all? You want to show the
> world how sad you are? Pathetic.

Some, like _dulek_ , do not mind the idea of a news updates page, still
[disliking](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-naszej-klasie-
gratulujemy-ambicji/) the new presents [PL]:

> Well those presents are stupid, but the idea of a news channel itself, as
> for me, is ok…

_Ryu_ , however, is one of the few who
[welcomes](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-naszej-klasie-
gratulujemy-ambicji/) the idea of black ribbons [PL]:

> I used to laugh at those black ribbons all the time, but today somehow….For
> god's sake, we put some kind of a band on our arm, if we cannot simply wear
> black, so why would we not mark our profiles with something on the Internet?
> Internet is (more or less) our second life in a way, so it must be normal
> that we want to express the same as we do in real life.

When _Nasza-Klasa_ took on board the criticism a day later and gave up on the
black ribbon presents, _Maras2003_
[noted](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-naszej-klasie-
gratulujemy-ambicji/) [PL]:

> NK has now changed their approach – one cannot add presents to the profile,
> but the whole profile works like RSS feed with the newest updates on
> catastrophe. Bravo! Could you not do this from the very beginning though?!

_Ag__ [points out](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-lotnicza-naszej-
klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) [PL]:

> There is a Facebook profile named “Smolensk catastrophe – all information.”
> As far as I understand, it's a way to provide updates to people, but somehow
> it feels stupid to click ‘become a fan’ :/

_Kukaszd_ [sums it all up](http://www.wykop.pl/link/344224/katastrofa-
lotnicza-naszej-klasie-gratulujemy-ambicji/) [PL]:

> I think that everyone should express their feelings, including sadness,
> individually. Somehow we seem to perceive commercialism as bad, and
> nonetheless we all support it. It would be ideal if everyone acted
> selflessly.
