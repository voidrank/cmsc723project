Fiji Water has left Fiji – at least for now.

In a brief, but pointed quarrel with Fiji's government, the US-based premium
water distributor that makes up 20 percent of Fiji’s exports has decided to
cease operations here and cancel outstanding development projects. On Monday,
November 29, the company laid-off nearly 400 people at its bottling plant in
the mostly rural Ra Province in Western Viti Levu, Fiji’s largest island. A
reporter for the Fiji Times
[estimates](http://fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=160924) the closure could
affect 4,000 people.

The public skirmish [started](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/11/20/fiji-
what-does-government-want-from-fiji-water/) on November 18 with the
deportation of Fiji Water's local representative, whom the government later
[claimed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/11/26/fiji-government-explains-
deportation-of-fiji-water-boss/) interfered in the country’s internal affairs.
Then on November 26, Fiji’s government
[released](http://www.fijilive.com/news/2010/11/29/28950.Fijilive) its 2011
budget, announcing a new Water Resources Tax, which increases the .11 cent per
liter levy to 15 cents per liter for any company extracting more than 3.5
million liters per month. The company called the tax
“[discriminatory](http://www.fijiwater.com/blog/2010/11/29/discriminatory-tax-
forces-shutdown-of-fiji-water-factory/)” and “untenable” because it singles
out Fiji Water. Per the new code, those companies not hitting 3.5 million
liter montly quota will continue paying .11 cents per liter. Presently Fiji
Water presently pays 1/3 of a cent per liter, according to [news
reports](http://www.fijilive.com/news/2010/11/29/28950.Fijilive).

This is not the first time the two parties disagreed over taxes. The company,
founded in 1996, was given 12 years of tax free status. When that ended in
2008, Fiji's government tried to levy a 15 cent per liter tax on all water
bottlers. Fiji Water, along with local bottlers, fought against the tax and
the company temporarily shut down its bottling plant. The government
eventually backed off the plan.

If Fiji Water does in fact shut down its operations, it will be the second
international corporation to leave FIji in 2010. In June, the government
[decreed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/03/has-rupert-murdoch-
declared-war-on-fiji/) that 90 percent of media outlets must be held in local
hands, forcing Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to disinvest from the country's
largest and oldest newspaper, the Fiji Times.

Monday's news became a battle of statements to the press. John Cochran,
President and COO of FIJI Water began:

> We consider the Government's current action as a taking of our business, and
> one that sends a clear and unmistakable message to businesses operating in
> Fiji or looking to invest there: the country is increasingly unstable, and
> is becoming a very risky place in which to invest.

He did, however, hold out support for finding a solution with the government.

In a statement, Fiji’s Frank Bainimarama countered:

> The Prime Minister said that “as usual Fiji Water has adopted tactics that
> demonstrate that Fiji Water does not care about Fiji or Fijians. They have
> made statements about supposed instability in Fiji and know it is not true,
> yet do so because they simply do not want to pay the new taxes.”
>
> …The Prime Minister said that if Fiji Water is no longer interested in Fiji
> then the Fijian Government, following cancellation of the leases, “will call
> for international tenders from credible and reputable private sector
> companies to extract this valuable resource.”

Crosbie Walsh, writing in _Fiji: The Way it is, Was and Can Be_
[worries](http://crosbiew.blogspot.com/2010/11/tale-of-two-statements-fiji-
water-and.html) about the path the two parties are taking:

> The news that Fiji Water will withdrawn from Fiji is more than a
> disappointment. It is a major blow to the workers in Ra province and the
> Fiji economy.
>
> I am encouraged by their comment that they are “willing to work through the
> Water Resource Tax issue with the government as it would be their preference
> to keep operating in the country” but find their comment on Fiji being “an
> increasingly unstable country” extraordinary.
>
> At this stage it would appear the company and the Government are both
> calling each other's bluff. Not always a wise move when so much is at stake
> for both parties.

Another comment from the blog had an
