More than dozen veterans of Georgia's wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia began
a hunger strike on December 27 demanding that the government address their
social problems and restore their medical discounts. Camping out in front of a
monument to fallen soldiers on Tbilisi's Heroes Square, the ex-soldiers said
that they would anyway leave on 6 January, the date of the Georgian Orthodox
Christmas Eve.

_Tamada Tales_ , a _EurasiaNet_ blog, [outlined their
demands](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/62655).

However, on 3 January, dozens of police officers broke up the strike just
hours after protesters allege the presidential escort passed them by. Without
proper warning, some veterans were arrested and excessive force was used. In
particular, an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) punched Eka
Matiashvili, an opposition party activist who was there to lend her support to
the protesters.

Although Georgian TV had aired footage of a protest from Moscow the same day,
there was little to no coverage of the Tbilisi incident. And with no official
acknowledgement from the government, parliament members said that they didn't
even know it had occurred. Instead, images were spread immediately online with
videos were uploaded to _Youtube_ and shared on _Facebook_. Many were
outraged.
