The silent caravan of the #marchanacional (national march) left Coajumulco
early on Friday morning, May 6, to continue on its way to El Zócalo in
downtown Mexico City.

_Jesus Robles Maloof_ has been blogging about the march, and he updated his
[blog](https://roblesmaloof.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/marcha-nacional-dia-2/)
[es] with reports on the second day. He reminds readers that a lot of the
people participating are parents, siblings and other family members that lost
a loved one during these 4 years and are still waiting to receive justice:

> Los rostros de Benjamín LeBaron y Luis Widmar, asesinados en Chihuahua, se
> podían observar en una enorme manta y ni que decir de los rostros sonrientes
> de Bety Cariño y Jiry Jaakkola, defensores de derechos humanos asesinados en
> San Juan Copala Oaxaca. En cierto sentido, quienes fueron abatidos marcharon
> con nosotros. Hablamos de sus vidas, escribimos sobre ellos. Los lloramos en
> ocasiones.

The faces of Benjamin LeBaron and Luis Widmar, killed in Chihuahua, could be
seen in a huge blanket and not to mention the smiling faces of Bety Cariño and
Jiry Jaakkola, human rights defenders killed in San Juan Copala, Oaxaca. In a
way, all those killed marched with us. We talk about their lives, we write
about them. We cried about them sometimes.

At 14:19 the march entered Mexico City and protesters were recieved by the
people of the town of Topilejo in Tlalpan on the southern part of the city,
where they spent the night. Journalist _Kristen Bricker_ wrote some reflexions
[about that day in her
blog](http://mywordismyweapon.blogspot.com/2011/05/reflections-on-mexicos-
national-anti.html):

> This march, more than anything, is a march against impunity. In some cases,
> police kidnapped and disappeared the victims. In another case, organized
> crime snatches little girls from a community and traffics them. In other
> cases, victims were killed in armed robberies. The perpetrators vary:
> organized crime, unorganized crime, or the government.

Twitter users were still very active the second day, showing support and
distributing information. However, Twitter [accounts
sabotaging](https://twitter.com/#!/EZLNoficial) #marchanacional started
spreading arguments against it, similar to the words used by the government:
“Why isn't this protests aimed at the narco?”

__ Supporters of #marchanacional gave a simple answer: they don’t represent
us. Twitter users quickly reported all of these accounts and at least one was
suspended for spam.

After [insisting that the government's
actions](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/06/mexico-day-1-of-peaceful-
protest-against-drug-war-violence/) are in the right direction, Felipe
Calderón expressed respect for #marchanacional [a day after
](http://www.proceso.com.mx/rv/modHome/detalleExclusiva/90993 )[es]:

> Es sensible a los ciudadanos y a su exigencia de tener un México sin
> violencia, por lo que las acciones de las fuerzas de seguridad están
> encaminadas a proteger a los ciudadanos y lograr el objetivo de tener un
> México de paz y justicia.

[The government] is sensitive to the citizens and their demand for a Mexico
without violence, because the actions of the security forces are directed to
protect citizens and achieve the goal of having a Mexico of peace and justice.

However reality shows that violence can be found everywhere in Mexico. On
Friday the human rights organization NoDHo
[denounced](http://nodho.org/?p=576) [es] the attempted kidnap ( _levantón_ )
of a woman that was on the Immigrant Caravan on the way to to join
#marchanacional. _Americas MexicoBlog_ [reports:](
http://americasmexico.blogspot.com/2011/05/migrants-attacked-en-route-to-
peace.html)

> A migrants’ caravan of 60 persons en route to join the March for Peace with

The Immigrant Caravan got to Puebla safely and joined the #marchanacional
caravan in the National University in Mexico City on Saturday.

#marchanacional has also started getting more international attention; on

Here is a video of the protest entering Mexico D.F and some footage of their
