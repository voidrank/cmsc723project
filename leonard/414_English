Category 5 mega [Cyclone
Yasi](http://water.thinkaboutit.eu/think5/post/cyclone_yasi_terror_not_crying_wolf/)
struck the North Queensland coast late on Wednesday 2 February 2011.
Reflecting recent disasters around the world, both new and old Australian
media have played complementary roles during the crisis.

_Facebook_ , _Twitter_ and the blogosphere were not just major sources of
information and support for the community, they were readily embraced by the
mainstream media, particularly television, and both the print and online
versions of daily newspapers.

_Facebook_ has been a focal point, of course. Many new groups or pages have
sprung up. Typical was [Cyclone Yasi
Update](http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/pages/Cyclone-Yasi-
Update/105722036172382?v=wall), which has over 90,000 Likes. Their message at
8 am drew 37 comments with 330 people liking it. Thanks to Garrett Wells and
team:

> More good news, because Yasi slowed down before it hit the coast, it hit on
> a falling tide, not a rising tide, and the storm surge that was possible did
> not eventuate and many areas that were expecting innundation were not
> affected by any surge….Garrett

Online magazine _New Matilda_ followed one indigenous community with a series
of updates:

> Yesterday we reported that the mostly Indigenous community of Palm Island,
> off the coast of Townsville, was unprepared for the approaching tropical
> cyclone.
>
> We spoke to residents on the island who told us they feared for their lives
> and questioned why the entire island hadn’t been evacuated. They said much
> of the housing on the island was not built to withstand a storm of Yasi’s
> strength.
>
> Thankfully the island was not as badly hit by the cyclone as expected.
> Queensland police have told us that all residents are okay, although power
> has been cut and the phone lines are down.

As usual group blog _Larvatus Prodeo_ has been active. This little gem is
worth a visit:

> The mainstream media coverage of natural disasters tends to filter local,
> lived experience through a narrow set of affective categories. This is
> largely because mass media rely on moral narratives: the evil of the
> cyclone/flood/fire, the goodness of the state in the aftermath, the evil of
> looters etc. These narratives makes for much more compelling viewing, but
> they’re often patronizing, self-serving and gloss over the multiplicity of
> connections between people, their belonging and the stuff of society: roads,
> electricity networks. Little wonder Bob Katter yesterday complained of media
> terrorizing residents with fear mongering.

Twitter tag [#duckhand](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23duckhand) has been
almost as popular as [#tcyasi](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23tcyasi).

A couple of tweets:

_mediahunter_ Craig Wilson has a poor opinion of mainstream television current
affairs shows:

> The misery of North Queenslanders has been compounded by arrival of crews
> from A Current Affair & TodayTonight. #TCYasi

_GuidoTresoldi_ enjoyed the gallows humour:

> I would like to propose that #tcyasi #duckhand be nominated for Australian
> of the Year.

Meanwhile _The Age_ , Melbourne's daily newspaper, is typical of old media who
have been running live blogs:

> As Cyclone Yasi stormed towards the Queensland Coast, we tracked the news
> from the ground, the web and around the world.  
>  [Cyclone Yasi live blog –
> Wednesday](http://www.theage.com.au/environment/weather/cyclone-yasi-live-
> blog--wednesday-20110202-1acsz.html)

As well as regular news updates _The Age_ has a ‘Twitter Conversation’, a feed
of several popular tags.

Television stations have relied heavily on _Twitter_ , _Youtube_ and social
media such as _Facebook_ for much of their content especially stories, videos
and photos. That’s beyond the scope of this post as is the wider blogosphere.
