Protests in Gabon have failed to make a dent in the international news cycle
as all eyes are still turned towards the Egyptian crisis. Mohamed Keita of the
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) was wondering if “[fake news wasn't
drawing real censorship]( http://cpj.org/blog/2011/02/in-gabon-fake-news-
draws-real-censorship.php)” in Gabon, as he discussed the closing of the first
private Gabonese TV channel, TV+.

According to Keita, the overreaction by the Ali Bongo's government is a sign
of a deeper concern: what was considered ridiculous by Ali Bongo and his
partisans before seems to have created subtantial political turmoil in this
little West African nation.  
The rhetorical strategy of Bongo's camp seems to consist of the total denial
of the opposition party, National Union.

[Sekou Oumar Doumbia](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000557953339),
a Bongo partisan, writes on Ali Bongo's [Facebook
page](http://www.facebook.com/alibongoondimba):

> Continuez de travailler et laissez les ridicules rêver.

Keep on working and let the ridiculous people dream on.

Nevertheless, the situation appears more complicated. In the last five days,
the country has witnessed civil unrest. But
[IQ4New](http://www.iq4news.com/)s, a columnist style magazine website
dedicated to African related issues,
[noticed](http://www.iq4news.com/iq4news/gabon-forgotten-protesters) that
protests in Gabon “have gone largely unnoticed by the media because of the
focus on Egypt”.

**Mass Protests in Libreville and the UNDP Building Attack**

Thanks to locally based activists, there has a been some coverage of protests;
they have also been advertised through different social networks.

Last Saturday 29 January, 2011, a demonstration was organised at Carrefour Rio
in Libreville, Gabon's capital city. More than 2,000 of opposition leader Mba
Obame's partisans went to protest against Ali Bongo's government and faced
public security forces.

Demonstration, Carrefour Rio in Libreville, 29 January, 2011

This demonstration was followed by violent clashes between Mba Obame's
partisans and Ali Bongo's Police forces, who were trapped by groups of
demonstrators in slums near the place where the demonstration started.

The same day, military forces were ordained to attack the United Nations
Program for Development (UNDP) building in Libreville, where Mba Obame and his
Government sought asylum. Camarade, a Gabonese activist, posted on his

**Wave of Arrests**

A dozen of executives and sympathisers of the National Union (NU) main
opposition party, have been arrested during the last five days.
[Koaci.com](http://koaci.com/) published a press release by President of NU:

> A 5 heures du matin plusieurs compatriotes ont été arrêtés, brutalisés et
> transférés au camp Aïssa (caserne du Bataillon des parachutistes gabonais),
> puis au camp de gendarmerie de Gros-Bouquet, avant d’être finalement gardés
> à vue, à partir du 28 janvier, dans les sous-sols de la Direction générale
> des Recherches de la Gendarmerie Nationale et ce, au mépris de la loi qui
> interdit toute garde à vue au-delà de 72h.”

At 5 am several comrades were arrested, brutalised, and transferred to the
Aïssa camp ( Barrack of the Gabonese Paratroopers’ battalion), then to the
Gros-Bouquet police station's camp, before being placed in custody, from 28
January, in the cellar of the Research General Direction of the National
Gendarmerie. Doing this they violated the law which forbids holding suspects
for more than 72 hours custody.

The opposition party's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bruno Ben Moubamba,
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/BBMoubamba/status/33130904327036928) this
morning about the kidnapping of the son of a Gabonese MP, Alexis Bengone:

> Organized Repression & Brutality in Gabon. Former Prime minister’ Son
> kidnapped by hooded men.
> [#revogab](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23revogab
> "#revogab")[#egypt](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23egypt "#egypt")
> [#tunisia](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23tunisia "#tunisia")
> [#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23civ2010 "#civ2010")

Some assume that his arrest is related to his online activism. He manages the
[Gabao Res Publica](http://gabao2009.ning.com/) social network and may have
tried to inspire youth uprisings with his
[article](http://gabao2009.ning.com/profiles/blogs/gabon-une-generation-en-
quete), ‘Gabon: A generation in quest of democratic sense’.
