floods

In less than a week, earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons have struck several
different countries in Oceania, East and Southeast Asia.

Previous Global Voices posts have kept us informed about what is going on at
ground level in [Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Vietnam with Typhoon
Ketsana (Ondoy](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/02/typhoon-ketsana-
batters-southeast-asia/)) and about the series of strong earthquakes in
Indonesia ([1](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/02/indonesia-post-quake-
death-toll-worsens/) and
[2](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/30/indonesia-strong-earthquake-hit-
west-sumatra/)) just a day after the Samoa Earthquake which triggered a
tsunami.

Through video uploading platforms, citizens who are experiencing these natural
disasters and their aftermath have shared their video clips, so that people
from other regions can identify the extent of the damages.

YouTube's CitizenTube blog have written a couple of posts regarding these
events. This first one has a playlist of clips of the [Samoa Earthquake and
Tsunami aftermath](http://www.citizentube.com/2009/09/tsunami-slams-american-
samoa.html):

And this other post has several videos of the [aftermath of the Sumatran
earthquake](http://www.citizentube.com/2009/10/padang-earthquake-
aftermath.html).

[This one has families](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4FB1TJcDt4) outside
their homes, running to grab railings in case there's an aftershock:

[This other](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7LMX7zyui8) shows a street view
of what seems to be a shopping center with extensive damage and an area on
fire:

This [next video ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqAdaiCZBQ4)regards Typhoon
(Ketsana) Ondoy, which hit the Philippines. In it you can see the extensive
flooding, and the cameraman writes this in his description:

> I just got back from the river's edge 5 minutes ago. A 10-15 feet height
> differential between the Marikina River and the embankment has now been
> reduced to the point that water is splashing against the high-rises of
> Eastwood, Metro Manila. A security guard for this sealed off area approaches
> me and covers me with his umbrella while I snap pictures from my phone.
> “Where are the police or firemen?” I asked. He first points at a speck in
> the middle of the river 300-400 meters out to my right. “That was a woman
> with her 2 year old infant clinging on to her. She passed through here in
> the middle of the river – waving at us for help. There was nothing we could
> do – she had passed though within 5 seconds. We've been seeing other people
> washed away.” We watched helplessly at the 20+ people 200 meters away that
> are now sitting on top of their corrugated roof-tops as the river rages
> beneath them on their submerged homes… waiting for emergency personnel yet
> to come.

[This video,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo3ZwOz7C2k) also about the
flooding, shows a different face to the emergency, in the rapidly rising
waters, a group of children can be seen playing and enjoying themselves:

It seems that humor has become one of the ways to cope with natural disasters
for Filipinos. [For example, in this blog post a message by Gwendolyn So is
reposted](http://royalflare.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/advice-from-an-
experienced-flood-victim/), where she tells of her 10+ years experiencing
flooding in her home at least once a year, you can see that even in the midst
of trying to rescue furniture, goods and family, there is a space for having
fun:

> 5\. You can have fun in the midst of disaster so I took out our cameras and
> starting taking pictures. It was to make everyone have a good laugh as we
> surveyed the chaos around us, the cockroaches and rats swimming by, the
> black inky spots of oily stuff occasionally floating around.

At the end, she puts things in perspective:

> It is easy to go insane after this kind of calamity, to despair of the
> material things we lost (especially the cars), but please be thankful you
> got away with your life and that of your family and loved ones
