The past week was marked by violent storm in many Brazilian states. Seven
people died in the southern Brazilian states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande
do Sul, while four people died in a São Paulo slum after a mudslide swept into
a slum last Tuesday. Thousands of people have been made homeless across the
country. The photos below have been taken in different places of the country
and shared under Creative Commons licenses on Flickr.

On September 8th, at 10:30 in the morning, 70% of the rain expected for the
whole month had fallen in São Paulo, as reported by flicker user
[gd365](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gd365/). This is said to be the most
rainy winter since 1943. As a result, there were traffic jams and cut off
phone services and electricity in some neighbourhoods of Latin America's
biggest metropolis.

Later on the day, in another part of the city, Flicker user
[ManoelNetto](http://www.flickr.com/photos/manoelnetto/) described the scene
unfolding in front of him as “The Apocalypse”.
