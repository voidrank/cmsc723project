Nominations open today (December 29, 2009) for the [Breaking Borders
Award](http://breakingborders.net/), a new prize created by
[Google](http://www.google.com) and [Global
Voices](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org) to honor outstanding web projects
initiated by individuals or groups that demonstrate courage, energy and
resourcefulness in using the Internet to promote freedom of expression. The
award is also supported by [Thomson Reuters](http://thomsonreuters.com/).

The Breaking Borders Award builds upon the values expressed in the [Global
Voices Manifesto](https://globalvoicesonline.org/about/gv-manifesto/), the
document co-written on a wiki in 2004 to articulate the guiding principles of
the organization and community that would come to be known as Global Voices.
The Manifesto opens with the words:

> “We believe in free speech: in protecting the right to speak — and the right
> to listen. We believe in universal access to the tools of speech.
>
> To that end, we seek to enable everyone who wants to speak to have the means
> to speak — and everyone who wants to hear that speech, the means to listen
> to it.”

The Breaking Borders Award also complements the work of [Global Voices
Advocacy](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org), which was formed in
February 2007 to bring focus to the organization's freedom of expression-
related activities.

The Breaking Borders Award is open to people of all nationalities. Winners
will be selected by a panel of experts in the field of freedom of expression.
A cash prize of $10,000 will be awarded in each of three areas:

1\. **Advocacy** , given to an activist or group that has used online tools to
promote free expression or encourage political change

2\. **Technology** , given to an individual or group that has created an
important tool that enables free expression and expands access to information

3\. **Policy** , given to a policy maker, government official or NGO leader
who has made a notable contribution in the field

Nominations for the Breaking Borders Award can be submitted at
[http://www.breakingborders.net](http://breakingborders.net/) and close on
February 15, 2010.
