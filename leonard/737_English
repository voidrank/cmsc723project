In the days following the [Israel Defense Forces
raid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid) on the [Mavi
Marmara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Mavi_Marmara) that left nine dead and
numerous others wounded, the world has seen an outpouring of support for Gaza.
Several countries, including [Turkey](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-
defense/turkey-recalls-envoy-over-gaza-flotilla-deaths-accuses-israel-of-
state-terrorism-1.293186),
[Ecuador](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898523,00.html), and
[South
Africa](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD9G3PN403),
have recalled their ambassadors to Israel, while [still
others](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704490204575279222111875404.html?mod=googlenews_wsj)
have called for investigations of the events by a neutral party.
[Nicaragua](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898523,00.html) went a
step further, cutting off diplomatic ties with Israel.

At the same time, demonstrations have been taking place around the globe. From
Stockholm to São Paulo, activists and concerned citizens have taken to the
streets to protest the violence and Israel's continuing blockade of Gaza.

In nearby Beirut, protesters [were
seen](http://thisisbeirut.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/gaza-flotilla-protest-in-
downtown-beirut/) carrying Turkish flags in support of the Mavi Marmara.

In London, rapper and poet [Lowkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowkey) was
at the lead of one demonstration, chanting “we are sick of it!” with other
demonstrators. One blogger, _Have a Good Time_ ,
[writes](http://amapofthecountry.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/wish-i-could-take-
your-tears-and-replace-them-with-laughterlong-live-palestine-long-
live%C2%A0gaza/) of Lowkey's appearance:

> Lowkey starts by reminding his British audience of their complicity in the
> Israeli attack on the Flotilla and the Israeli siege on Gaza. “We were there
> through our taxes: our taxes were in the bullets that were fired into our
> friends and our brothers and our sisters…our taxes were there, our Balfour
> Declaration was there.” But Lowkey transitions from this depressing reminder
> of complicity to a vision of solidarity. “When they drop white phosphorous
> bombs on Gaza, they drop white phosphorous bombs on us…we must express our
> solidarity with those people, because they are us.” We are not only the
> Freedom Flotilla: we are Gaza. In addition to knowing that we cause harm to
> befall Gaza, we also feel that harm as if it affects us.

The protest was recorded on video:

Global Voices author Raphael Tsavkko Garcia snapped photos of a protest in São
Paulo, Brazil, which he [posted on his

The protest itself was brief, lasting about an hour, but the speeches were
energetic and passionate. Cries of “Israel Genocidal”, “Israel Nazi” and “Free
Palestine” were constant and we also distribute pamphlets among many
passersby. These, Moreover, in general supported us, waving, commenting that
it was an absurd situation of the Palestinians and repudiating Israel and
their criminal actions.  
[…]  
It was a small act but full of meaning. At least a few people showed their
displeasure, their outrage and made it clear that they will not tolerate
further attacks.

Finally, Israel was not immune from criticism by its own citizens. In Tel
Aviv, demonstrators held signs protesting the occupation. According to [the
photographer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dan_halutz/4663831834/), one of the
protesters was detained, as was a counter-protester.
