against Uzbek people and traditions. This fact caused indignation among local
and foreign journalists, photographers and Internet users.

At the moment, more than 600 people from various countries signed the online

Many bloggers condemn authoritarian actions of the state bodies. _Kinobomj_
[is much more outspoken](http://kinobomj.livejournal.com/16243.html "is
commenting") (ru):

Blogger _[mulioshka](http://mulioshka.livejournal.com "mulioshka ")_[
](http://mulioshka.livejournal.com "mulioshka ")thinks that Umida's problems
can be related to the issue of ethnic minorities in Uzbekistan – a topic,
which the authorities always tries to avoid discussing. She

Many believe that the main reason for prosecution of photographer Umida
Akhmedova is her active civil position. _Albatrossdoc_ [writes
](http://albatrossdoc.livejournal.com/32789.html?thread=389909 "writes ")(ru)
that Umida Akhmedova and her husband Oleg Karpov (director of Tashkent Film
Museum) were way too active for Uzbekistan – making films, photos and showing
social topical movies in the Film Museum.

_Albatrossdoc_ guesses that there could be people, who didn’t like it. The
Museum has been closed for the last three months and no official explanation
was given.

Having a look at Umida’s pictures one can see that she makes photos of the
ordinary Uzbek people. Many of them live in poverty – and many are in
desperate poverty. Blogger _[kambodjaa](http://kambodjaa.livejournal.com
"kambodjaa  ")_[ ](http://kambodjaa.livejournal.com "kambodjaa  ")says [this
was the main reason for
persecution](http://dadakinder.livejournal.com/1150534.html "the main reason
for persecution") of the photographer (ru):

> Great photos. But on some of them one can see what exactly is the most
> disturbing thing for the patriarchal-authoritarian society. It is clear why
> they charge her.
