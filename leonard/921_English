As a result of [the catastrophic 7.0 earthquake that hit the ~~island~~
country this evening](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N12208897.htm)
(January 12), “Haiti” is currently a trending topic on Twitter. Among the mass
of retweets of mainstream media reports and tweets sending prayers and good
wishes to the Caribbean ~~island~~ nation, have been eyewitness reports from
musician and hotelier [Richard
Morse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Auguste_Morse), who tweets as
@[RAMHaiti](http://twitter.com/RAMhaiti/). Morse posted his [initial
tweet](http://twitter.com/RAMhaiti/status/7687163421) around 6:00pm Haiti
time, reporting that:

> were ok at the oloffson [the hotel he runs] ..internet is on !! no phones !
> hope all are okay..alot of big building in PAP [Port-au-Prince, Haiti's
> capital city] are down !

A series of tweets sent an hour later reported:

> [Just about all the lights are out in Port au Prince.. people still
> screaming but the noise is dying as darkness
> sets.](http://twitter.com/RAMhaiti/status/7687506699)

> [lot's of rumors about which buildings were toppled..The Castel Haiti behind
> the Oloffson is a pile of rubble..it was 8 stories

Later, Morse [re-tweeted](http://twitter.com/isabelleMORSE/status/7689054957)
@isabelleMORSE, who reported “ [much destruction on Grand Rue (Ave Dessalines)
Daniel Morel's ok. Police Sta, Cathedral, Downtown teleco, Church St Anne all
destroyed](http://twitter.com/isabelleMORSE/status/7689054957)“.  
  
Just after 7:30pm Haiti time, Morse wrote that:

> [Phones are starting to work..got a call from some one who's house fell in,
> child is hurt but ok. .](http://twitter.com/RAMhaiti/status/7689482279)[A

>
> [people are needing medical supplies..food, housing; I don't know water
> situation;](http://twitter.com/RAMhaiti/status/7689726639)

Then, around 7:45pm:

> [another aftershock..people are screaming and freaking out down towards the
> stadium..much singing and praying in large
> numbers](http://twitter.com/RAMhaiti/status/7690007843)

And at around 8:40pm Haiti time:

> [another aftershock..a little longer..much screaming downtown..this is going
> to be a long night](another aftershock..a little longer..much screaming
> downtown..this is going to be a long night)
