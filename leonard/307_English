2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-

Three design-related projects have emerged out of the destruction of the
earthquake and tsunami that hit the northeast coast of Japan last Friday 11
March, 2011.

The creators of the
[#prayforjapan](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23prayforjapan)
initiative that encourages well-wishers across the world to send messages of
support via microblogging site Twitter and make online donations, have made a
[number of logos](https://sites.google.com/site/prayforjapan311/) available in
multiple sizes for print, animated banners, and social media icons.

Pray for Japan donation box logo

This project is being led by blogger and advertising expert Naoyuki Sato,
better known as Satonao. He
[explains](http://www.satonao.com/archives/2011/03/55.html) [jp] how the
project began after he received a
[tweet](http://twitter.com/hossib/status/46517308537057280) by Mikihiko
Sawahata ([@hossib](http://twitter.com/hossib)), the owner of a Japanese
restaurant Bissoh in Beaune, France:

> さとなおさん、店で義援金を募集したいのですが募金箱のデザインをして下さる方はいらっしゃいませんか？
> PDFファイルにして上げていただければ全世界でDLして印刷し、色々な場所におけます。

Satonao, I’d like to raise money at my restaurant and I was wondering if you
knew of anyone who would be able to design a donation box for me. If it can be
uploaded on the Internet as a PDF file, it can be downloaded, printed and used
across the world.

> すぐに友人の石川淳哉さん（@junyaishikawa）にツイッターで相談し、「すぐ動こう」となり、あっという間に超多忙なデザイナー森本千絵さん（@morimotochie）にアプローチ。快諾をいただいて約１日、こんなデザインのマークが完成した。想いが詰まっていて、温かいいいマークだと思う。松永有子さん（@ebiita）、押井猛さん（@gatyaping2）のご協力も得て出来上がった。

I immediately contacted my friend Junya Ishikawa (@junyaishikawa) over
Twitter. We decided that we should “act immediately”, and we approached the
extremely busy designer Chie Morimoto (@morimotochie) who readily agreed to
the request. After only a day, the logo was completed. I think it’s a deep-
felt and heart-warming symbol. The help of Yuko Matsunaga (@ebiita) and
Takeshi Oshii (@gatyaping2) was also important in making this happen.

The project is also calling on people to provide localized versions at
[@prayjp](http://twitter.com/prayjp).

[#setsudencopy](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23setsudencopy) is the
hashtag being used for a crowd-sourced project to create graphic posters with
the message to conserve electricity. The upbeat site explains its mission in
this way:

>
> いまTwitter#setsudencopyで温かい節電コピーが生まれている。人が人を思う気持ちに感動だ。Twitterの中だけに留めておくのはMOTTAINAI!
>
> そこで！  
>  節電コピーのポスターを募集するぜ。印刷して、街中に貼ってくれ。（もちろん許可は取るんだよ。）  
>
> 「アタシ家にプリンターなんて無いもの！」って子！なんと、セブンイレブンで印刷できちゃうんだぜ。各ポスターの下にある「ネットプリント」の番号をコピー機に入力するだけ！
>
> 「俺もポスターつくった！」って人は、下の [節電ポスターを投稿する] ボタンをクリック！インターネット歴1年未満の子は、メールで送ってね！

Heart-warming taglines appealing for energy saving are coming into the world
on Twitter with the hash-tag #setsudencopy. It was inspired by the concern
people have shown for each other. It’s a shame to keep this just to Twitter!

That’s why we’re asking for energy saving POSTERS! Print them, and cover the
walls of your city (well, don’t forget to ask for permission ok?) You don’t
have a printer? No problem. Did you know Seven-Eleven has printers? You just
have to enter the “net print” number at the bottom of each poster into the
photocopier at the store!

If you’ve made a poster, then click on “post this energy saving poster”! If
you’re new to the Internet, just send it to us by email!

Graphics are being submitted to the project's [Tumblr
blog](http://setsuden.tumblr.com/), with the first one posted on March 12,
2011.

The images are available to the public:

> このサイトにあるポスターはデザイナーたちの心意気によって、パブリックドメインドメインになっている。つまり、誰に許可を取ることなく、印刷、編集、転載など、自由かつ無制限に使っていいんだ。これらのポスターが少しでも早く、たくさんの人の行動に結びつくことを願っている。

All the posters in this website are provided in the public domain thanks to
the understanding of our designers. In other words, you can print, edit and
reproduce those posters without any limits and without having to ask for
anyone’s permission. We sincerely hope these posters will lead many people to
act fast.

Art contribution by Takehiko Inoue.

GEISAI is a gigantic art/design event founded by contemporary artist [Takashi
Murakami](http://www.takashimurakami.com/) in 2001. The 15th installment was
to be held on March 13, 2011, at the [Tokyo Big
Sight](http://www.bigsight.jp/english/) convention center.

In a statement announcing the cancellation, Murakami made a
[suggestion](http://ameblo.jp/geisai-net/entry-10830268183.html):

> With the theme of providing encouragement to the victims and those who have
> despaired in the quake's aftermath, will you join me in uploading artwork to
> Twitter's affiliated image posting sites?
>
> As an art festival, GEISAI should be on the front lines of this movement and
> it is with that in mind that we have selected the theme below and ask
> everyone to begin submitting their images!
>
> The hashtag will be
> [#newday_GEISAI](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23newday_GEISAI)
>
> Tomorrow will always arrive.
>
> The sun will always rise again.
>
> A new day,
>
> This is our theme.
