The New Year is here, and with it has come new problems for the Bhutanese.

Starting this month the Bhutanese government has put into “serious practice”
its draconian “[Tobacco Control
Act,”](http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=17494)
which was enacted on June 1, 2009. According to this act, any citizen in
defiance can be charged with a fourth degree felony that can fetch a prison
term of 5 – 9 years.

Although this should be more of a hindrance to smokers and businessmen, even
citizens who don’t smoke are beginning to question the number of bans
infringing on their privacy and freedom, and the misplaced emphasis on
cigarettes rather than alcohol and drugs. _Truth_ , a commenter on _Tshering
Tobgay's_ blogpost titled “[Parliament passes Tobacco Control
Bill](http://www.tsheringtobgay.com/legislature/2010/parliament-passes-
tobacco-control-bill.html)” says:

Just yesterday [BusinessBhutan

“Authorities will raid
[drayangs](http://tandinpem.blogspot.com/2009/10/drayang-culture.html) &
discotheques today evening to ensure the compliance to the new tobacco control
rules” . Nothing unfamiliar. In [2005, Bhutanese
legislators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smoking_bans) had banned
sales of all tobacco products ostentatiously [becoming the first nation in the
world](http://www.slate.com/id/2112449/) to take smoking bans way further than
the rest. Bhutanese officials seemed to welcome and gloat in [international
media coverage](http://www.slate.com/id/2112449/fr/rss/) for having done so.
At that time authorities even burned stashes of tobacco products worth
millions of Ngultrums legitimately purchased.

Kuensel reported that according to the new Act, a Bhutanese above 18 years of
age is allowed to import 200 sticks of cigarettes or 30 pieces of cigars, or
150g of other tobacco products a month.

They will be charged 200 percent sales tax and customs duty for tobacco
products originating from countries other than India and 100 percent on those
from India.

When the items are declared at Customs, the person will be issued a receipt
reflecting the details of his import and his identity. The receipt will be
valid for a month from date of issue and the person will have to have the
receipt of him at the time of smoking – in case he is asked by the law to
produce validity.

Which leaves you wondering about the logistics of how this can be implemented.
The ban on smoking and cigarette sales that arose in 2005 became largely
ineffective, for reasons that it was an ill-thought and impractical process,
which in turn became something of an embarrassment in the end rather than
something to be proud of when people were still found puffing away to glory.

And how popular is this Act? While it does have health benefits, voices on
online forums point out the fallacy of such a law.

Under the thread “Tobacco and Receipts” on
[Bhutantimes.com](https://www.bhutantimes.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4573&forum=10),
an online forum where Bhutanese give vent to their feelings on issues mostly
under pseudonyms, this was the discussion:

_Kokariko_ said:

_Raksha_ dared the govt:

While _Number_Uno_ said:

But _Drupkinley_ thought of more dire consequences:

And Migyel questioned the reasoning for this law:

But where this is a will there is a way. _Blankslate_ said:

> Create a black-market and give gangs a way to finance themselves… Nice going

Although black markets always exist for banned products, what need to create
an extreme one for Tobacco products?

In the end
[Chhoeki](http://www.tsheringtobgay.com/legislature/2010/parliament-passes-
tobacco-control-bill.html) had a simple suggestion which might have been the
way to go:

> What the Government really needs to do is:  
>  1\. prohibit smoking in public designated areas and ACTUALLY enforce this
> rule.  
>  2\. place high tax on import/sale of tobacco products rather than make it
> illegal to sell them. This would increase the price of tobacco products, and
> I am certain that the demand would actually go down. The government would
> also be able to generate additional revenue.
