In the aftermath of the devastating Haiti earthquake, women and girls are
still facing gender violence, as some of them not only experience rape, but
then have to face an absent judicial system and less than adequate medical
care.

Women in Haitian Relief
Camps_](http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/07/28/rape-a-part-of-daily-life-

for Justice and Democracy in Haiti ([IJDH](http://ijdh.org))and
[Madre](http://www.madre.org/index.php?s=4&news=473)‘s [Report on
Rape](http://ijdh.org/archives/13661) in the Internally Displaced Persons
(IDP) Camps as the source of terrifying statistics on gender violence.

Many women and girls have lost their support network as well as fathers,
brothers and husbands or boyfriends who might've been able to protect them. So
being in cramped quarters in the camps really cuts down on their privacy, many
have to shower in public and sleep next to strangers or in locations where
they are vulnerable to attacks. Once the attacks take place, many of the cases
being gang rapes, they have yet to face more ordeals: most have no way to
receive medical aid from female practitioners and the justice system is almost
non-existent, leaving them to deal with corruption in the police and
revictimization from authorities in addition to the stigma from being attacked
and the knowledge that their attackers are still at large. Ulysse writes:

> Women’s access to jus­tice has been even worse. Women who reported rapes–and

The IJDH, Partners in Health and New Media Advocacy Program released a [video
a few months ago with testimonies from the
victims](http://vimeo.com/11091051). The footage was recorded by Sandy
Berkowitz and edited by Harriet Hirshorn.

Even though women struggle to return to normalcy, it is unlikely their
situation will improve as the temporary camps seem to be [turning into
permanent accomodations. Back in January,

interviewed Dr. Franck
Geneus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_t7v5hy3Sc&feature=channel) who
coordinates CARE's health program in Haiti and asked him about the reasons why
there is higher risk of rape in these camps, and he mentioned the
characteristics that make the IDP camps a fertile ground for attacks: the lack
of electricity that makes camps absolutely dark at night, badly organized
camps and non-segregated bathing facilities and latrines so that males and
females have their own.

Janet Meyers, Gender Advisor from CARE also [put in her own 2 cents regarding
how the camps would be established to make women safer in the earthquake
aftermath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RysTVdhcoIw&feature=related),
pointing out many of the same issues last February. I wonder how many of these
issues remain unresolved and if, as these camps turn into more permanent
facilities, it will just pave the way for more assaults to take place.
