On Feb. 26, some 40 people attended a debate titled “Islam as a threat – again
in fashion?”, held at the [Center for Culture and Debate “Red
House”](http://www.redhouse-sofia.org/) in the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia.
Speakers included Saleh Breh, a psychologist at the University of Damascus,
Vladimir Chukov, a specialist in Islam, and Nidal Hlayf, a student in film
directing.

Approximately [1 million Muslims live in
Bulgaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Bulgaria) (whose total
population is about 8 million people). Many people have an idea about Islam,
because there has been a Muslim population in the country for centuries. But
there are political parties that create problems between Christians and
Muslims: in recent years nationalism has become stronger and more aggressive,
and some people believe that Islam is dangerous. This is why [a debate like
the one that took place in Sofia](http://www.redhouse-
sofia.org/Event.aspx?id=4752) (BUL) is important for the society. Its purpose
was to discuss whether Islam presents a danger for Europe. Among others,
members of the nationalist [Bulgarian National Movement
party](http://www.vmro.bg/) attended the debate; according to BNM, Islam is
dangerous and is an instrument of Turkish interests. (Here is a link to
Vladimir Chukov's article on the [“Bulgarian Ethnic
Model.”](http://crcs0.tripod.com/lgivl.html)

A post on the debate appeared on _Muslims and American Cinema_
(<http://muslim-cinema.blogspot.com>), a Bulgarian-language blog on
stereotypical portrayal of Muslims in the movies, administered by Hlayf Nidal,
who has written a doctoral thesis in film directing in Sofia. Below are
excerpts from [this post](http://muslim-cinema.blogspot.com/2010/02/blog-
post.html) (BUL):

> Professor Chukov outlined the two main types of immigration patterns –

There are some [comments to my blog
post](http://ruslantrad.wordpress.com/2010/02/24/red-house-debate-for-
islam/#comments) (BUL) for this event. One reader wrote about Islamism and
terrorism in other Balkan states:

> Around us [Bulgaria], it is better not to forget Bosnia and Kosovo, which
> are copies of those ideas in the Balkans.

The situation in Kosovo is important for Bulgaria because many people fear
that what happened there and in Bosnia could happen in Bulgaria, too.
