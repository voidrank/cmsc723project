Ali Hili, the leader of an Iraqi lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)
group, has been told his asylum application will not be prioritized by the UK
government, even though the [UN High Commissioner for Refugees recommends
“favourable consideration” for such “at risk”groups of
people](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30702&Cr=iraq&Cr1).

Hili's application, which has been outstanding for for three years, prevents
him from travelling and therefore, his supporters say, inhibits his efforts to
raise the profile of [Iraqi LGBT](http://iraqilgbtuk.blogspot.com), a London-
based group which started campaigning in 2003.

“Hili has received many requests to speak about the situation in Iraq
internationally, including from US-based groups such as the Gay Liberation
Network and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Campaign, which he
has been unable to pursue,” [say
campaigners](http://iraqilgbtuk.blogspot.com/p/ali-must-travel.html).

“He desperately wishes to do this [travel] in order to further the aims of his
organisation, that is, supporting lesbians and gay men in Iraq and bringing
the world's attention to their plight,” Hili's solicitor wrote to the UK
Border Agency in 2009.

Over 700 Iraqi LGBT people have been assassinated in the past six years, says
Iraqi LGBT. Hili has been issued with a fatwa from inside Iraq.

Pink News has [more background details in a comment piece by Paul Canning, gay
rights activist and LGBT Asylum News webmaster, at this
link](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/03/23/exclusive-campaigner-says-delay-in-
asylum-claims-killing-gay-iraqis/ ). Canning says:

In November 2009 the Gays Without Borders blog [published this Iraqi LGBT
account of the situation for gays and lesbians in
Iraq](http://gayswithoutborders.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/terror-campaign-
against-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-iraqis-continues-unchecked-by-
iraqi-government/).

Despite the reported risks, UKBA's latest response that refuses Hili a
priority application says:

  * the assistance given by Hili to the Foreign Office “does not count”
  * the fatwa [issued on Hili] does not mean that Hili “falls within the classification of clear and immediate vulnerability”
  * that the delay in deciding Hili's asylum case (since July 2007) “is not in itself an exceptional circumstance”
  * his case is not “compelling”

Iraqi LGBT [has some suggestions for UK citizens who wish to help appeal
against Hili's case:](http://iraqilgbtuk.blogspot.com/p/ali-must-travel.html)
for example, writing to the home secretary, the prime minister, and your local
MP.

For those outside the UK [the campaign suggests asking politicians and
organisations to invite Hili to your
country](http://iraqilgbtuk.blogspot.com/p/ali-must-travel.html) (something he
wouldn't be able to do under the current restrictions) and publicizing the
requests.

Meanwhile, supportive comments are gathering on [the petition to the home
office asking the UK government to expedite the
case](http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/iraqi-lgbt-need-your-help/sign.html)
(with just under 600 names at the time of writing).

One signatory, Paul Allen, says:

> Would you want to live any longer in a society that treats you, the person
> you are with fear, hatred and violence, an agenda pushed by religion?

Ron Addison adds simply:

> Shame on you, Sort it out NOW.
