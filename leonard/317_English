In the days following the disastrous earthquake that struck Japan on March
11th, many are asking, “What can I do?”.

Chodo, who works as a geographic information systems technician in Osaka,
calls for people to quell the instinctive and emotional reaction to head
towards the disaster area. In “To the kindhearted young, who want to help the
afflicted -My shallow-minded experience- ”
([被災者の役に立ちたいと考えている優しい若者たちへ～僕の浅はかな経験談～](http://chodo.posterous.com/45938410)),
he shares a personal story of what he learned from volunteering during the
[Hanshin Earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanshin_earthquake) in
1995. Published on March 14th three days after the earthquake hit, the post
received over 300 comments in two days, most of which thank the blogger for
his calm, thought-provoking words.

When the Great Hanshin Earthquake hit, I was in my third year at high school
and it was the day after the preliminary university entrance examinations.
