On August 31st 2010, [ PlusNews and IRIN in
Johannesburg](http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=90337) highlighted
the story of Veronica (a pseudonym), a HIV+ woman, who found out that she has
been sterilized by nurses without any warnings [fr]:

> Veronica* did not realize she had been sterilized while giving birth to her
> daughter until four years later when, after failing to conceive, she and her
> boyfriend consulted a doctor.  
>  “I was like ‘Okay, fine’, because there was nothing I could do by then, but
> I was angry. I hate [those nurses],” she told IRIN/PlusNews. Veronica tested
> HIV-positive during a routine antenatal visit and was given a form to sign
> by nurses at the hospital where she went to deliver.  
>  “I didn't know what it was all about, but I did sign,” said Veronica, who
> was 18 at the time and had been scolded by the nurses for being unmarried.

On June 4th, _Servaas van den Bosch_ of IPS [
asked:](http://ipsinternational.org/fr/_note.asp?idnews=5887) «Are Namibian
Women Being Forcibly Sterilised? (Les femmes sont-elles en train d’être
stérilisées de force?)»[fr] :

> Un procès historique, prétendant que des femmes séropositives ont été
> stérilisées de force dans des hôpitaux publics en Namibie, a commencé le 1er

>  Des groupes de défense des droits humains affirment que la pratique a

A historical trial took place June 1st at the High Court of Windhoek, the
capital city. HIV+ women assert that they were sterilized by force in public
hospitals of Namibia.  
Human rights activist groups affirm that the practice continued long after the
authorities were informed  
The Legal Assistance Center (LAC) based in Windhoek is defending 15 cases of
alleged forced sterilization. Three cases will be heard first and each women
are asking for $132,000 USD for damages and interest.

The first cases of sterilization were found first by the International
Community of Women (ICW) living with AIDS. _Veronica Kalambi_ of ICW
[declares](http://ipsinternational.org/fr/_note.asp?idnews=5887) [fr]:

> Les premiers cas sont apparus au cours des réunions communautaires au début
> de 2008. Dans les mois qui ont suivi, nous avons interrogé 230 femmes, parmi
> lesquelles 40 ont été stérilisées contre leur gré”,

The first cases appeared during communitarian meeting in early 2008. In the
following months, we interviewed 230 women, of which 40 were sterilized
against their will.

Reacting to the [article about forced sterilization in 2009 in
Namibia](http://www.afrik.com/article17050.html) in the comment section,
_Maxi_ opines:

> Despicable brutes! – do you also castrate HIV+ men ? So Dr Menguele's legacy
> is still alive and well in Namibia. What a shame, these doctors who soil the
> ethics of their mission.

_Zimunina M._ adds:

> Hi there! Dear doctor, what will you tell these women that you just
> sterilized if tomorrow a cure for AIDS becomes available in Namibia ? In my
> opinion, you belong in prison and the government and the WHO should take
> away your diploma

The website _osi.bouake.free.fr_ also [reposted an
article](http://osi.bouake.free.fr/?African-women-with-HIV-coerced) on _The
Guardian_ by David Smith from Johannesburg that denouces those practices:

> In South Africa, cases are being referred to the Women’s Legal Centre with a
> view to a possible action. Promise Mthembu, a researcher at Witwatersrand
> University, said coerced sterilisations were happening in “very large areas”
> of the country.  
>  Many patients were forced to undergo the operation as the only means of
> gaining access to medical services, Mthembu told the Mail & Guardian
> newspaper.

[rmbengou](http://aidsrightscongo.org/?author=3), on _AIDS RIGHTS CONGO_ also
denounces these medical practices. He writes in a post entitled: [“In Central
Africa, HIV-positive women are blamed for their
sexuality](http://aidsrightscongo.org/?p=471)“:

> Gabriel Maliyere, the head of the AHVV program, emphasizes how “the behavior
> of medical personnel is deplorable. After their prenatal exams, HIV-positive
> women are condemned for the fact that they’re pregnant.”
>
> HIV-positive women are expected to cease having sex and conceiving. In this
> sense, women are blamed for their sexuality. Yafouta-Kaïe, a member of the
> National Congress of Young Women Living with HIV/AIDS (CNJFV+), claims:
> “Above all, it is the hurtful words and the coldness of certain midwives,
> during childbirth, towards women living with HIV.”
>
> .

In the same article, he indicates that a few projects are underway to change
this situation:

> Other public campaigns, HIV/AIDS film screenings, and debates over the
> rights of HIV-positive persons, were organized on December 8 and 9, 2009,
> northwest of Bangui and in the 8th _arrondissement._ During these campaigns,
> speakers presented on the following themes, which were especially chosen for
> this educational day : “I am secure, I am accepted, I am receiving
> treatment, I am in firm possession of my rights, the right to live, and to
> wellbeing.”

Unfortunately those are not isolated cases. In an article on afrik.com,
_Habibou Bangré_[reveals that](http://www.afrik.com/article16855.html) [fr]:

> …exceptée celle du Togo, toutes les lois des pays africains – et celles
> d’autres Etats hors du continent – peuvent s’appliquer pour pénaliser la
> transmission du VIH de la mère à l’enfant. En conséquence, une femme
> séropositive qui transmettrait le virus à son enfant au cours de la
> grossesse, l’accouchement ou l’allaitement pourrait être poursuivie en
> justice. La Sierra-Leone va même plus loin et condamne spécifiquement la
> transmission mère-enfant, remettant ainsi en cause le droit des femmes
> séropositives à procréer.

Except for Togo, the legal write-up of most african countries- and as a matter
of fact, outside the continent- can be implemented in a way that will penalize
the the mother to child transmission of HIV. Therefore, a HIV+ woman who would
transmit the virus to her child during pregnancy, child birth or nursing can
be charged in a court of law. In Sierra Leone, it goes further and condemns
specifically the mother-to-child transmission, therefore possibly revoking the
reproductive rights of HIV+ women.

Two bloggers were outraged and [commented
thusly](http://www.afrik.com/reactions16855.html#30475):

_pvvih_ says :

> A state that implements such measures must make ARVs available to all first.
> I am an African student and I am taking ARVs. ARVs that many consider a
> panacea are not easy to take. They sometimes bring more suffering than good.
> Countries must support research for better treatments and therefore give
> more money.

_Mona_ adds:

> Some of these women were abused, violated and raped etc. Why must they be
> punished? And men in all that, don't they have some responsibilities in this
> matter? Let's cure these women instead of punish them. Let's give them
> contraceptives, guidances etc… this is really scandalous.
