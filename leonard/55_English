Coworking is a growing worldwide movement, and Japan is no exception. Although
known for its culture of long working hours and office-bound work style —
traditions ingrained into the psyche of the salaried worker — the shift to
coworking is not perhaps as surprising as it may seem.

The phase “nomad worker” hit mainstream consciousness with the publication of
“You don’t need an office to work – The Nomad Workstyle” ([仕事するのにオフィスはいらない –
ノマドワーキングのすすめ](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E4%BB%95%E4%BA%8B%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AB%E3%82%AA%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AF%E3%81%84%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84-%E5%85%89%E6%96%87%E7%A4%BE%E6%96%B0%E6%9B%B8-%E4%BD%90%E3%80%85%E6%9C%A8-%E4%BF%8A%E5%B0%9A/dp/4334035159))
by popular writer [Toshinao
Sasaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshinao_Sasaki) in July, 2009. The
conversation was taken to the next level by the earthquake on March 11th and
the events that followed. With Tokyo facing several weeks of severely
disrupted work and months of [reduced electricity
usage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/15/japan-how-to-unplug-your-
life-and-save-electricity/), the conversation around alternative methods of
working naturally accelerated, from [daylight savings
time](http://af.reuters.com/article/idAFL3E7EQ00I20110326) to a renewed
interest in freelancing. Coworking was among these.

Journalist/consultant Ken Kato
[defines](http://blogs.itmedia.co.jp/socialreal/2011/08/coworking-5-dc7e.html)
it this way:

> コワーキング（Coworking）とは一言でいえば、アイディアや情報・ファシリティ・スキルなどをシェアすることにより、オフィス環境を共有する相乗効果を生み出そうとする新しい働き方です。既存のレンタルオフィスのような時間貸しのスペースとは異なり、会議室やイベントスペース等を兼ね備えたオープンな空間になっているのも特徴で、単なる空間ではなく、コミュニティ･スペースであると言えるでしょう。

In a nutshell, coworking is a new style of working that aims to generate a
synergetic effect through the exchange of ideas, information, facilities, and
skills in a shared working environment. Coworking offices, many of which have
meeting rooms and event spaces, offer an inherent openness that make them
different from existing pay-by-the-hour spaces such as rental offices. They're
not just a venue but a community space.

Here is a shortlist map of coworking spaces in Japan. The green pins stand for
spaces that allow both membership and drop ins, light blue is for shared
offices (membership only), yellow is for cafe spaces (drop in only), pink is
for corporate spaces (drop in only), and blue is for those that are not
categorized.

New coworking spaces are popping up like crazy, mostly in Tokyo, Osaka, and
Kobe. One such example is “The Terminal” in Harajuku, Tokyo. Blogger Ayako
[documents](http://hlywd.co.jp/cafe/2011/08/the-terminal.html) her visit on
its opening day this past August with a photo report.

The incredible buzz around the opening reception for Terminal is indicative of
great interest in the new coworking space. I truly feel that the interest in
nomad workers and workstyles is growing day by day. We're living in an age
where we are consciously working through interactions with other people, and
without being tied down to a physical location!

Tony Bacigalupo, the co-founder of New Work, visited no less than four
coworking spaces in Tokyo on a recent trip. He
[comments](http://happymonster.co/2011/08/22/coworking-in-tokyo-shanghai-and-

coriander.

Startup incubator Samurai Incubate just announced that it will open a
coworking space for its startups, making it one of the country’s largest
facilities of its kind. In an [article](http://www.penn-
olson.com/2011/10/17/samurai-incubation-office/) covering their announcement,
tech writer Masaru Ikeda provides [a map
of](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?vpsrc=6&ctz=-540&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=215693144356033562781.0004af6900612a8869e94&t=m&source=embed&ll=35.648927,139.723434&spn=0.167391,0.205307&z=11)
other startup-related facilities, saying:

> incubation offices here in Tokyo.

Real estate developer Mori Building has also been in the game for a while,
with a membership program for a shared library and coworking space in the
skyscrapers of Roppongi Hills. Again, Tony Bacigalupo:

> They are the boldest attempt I’ve seen at merging library with coworking.
> And the location we visited is perched on the 49th floor of a big office
> tower. And they’re _huge_.

Existing cafes and restaurants have also started to cater to this segment.
@elm200 [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/elm200/status/126548241918595072) about
a branch of the 45+y.o. mega-chain Renoir Cafe, which offers free wifi and
power chargers to customers.

> うーむ渋谷桜丘のルノアールの癖に客が多い…つかルノアールって数年前よりずっと流行っている気がするのよね。内装もきれいにしたし、ノマドワーカーを始め、PC
> を使うビジネス客をうまくつかまえている気がするね。

Hmmm, the Sakuragaoka branch in Shibuya is really crowded, even though it's a
Renoir cafe…!? Now that I think about it, Renoir is much trendier than it used
to be. The interior decoration has improved and it feels like they've succeed
in getting the patronage of business people using laptops, starting with nomad
workers.

Because of the nature of the open communication, there is a lot of information
online about it. The [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/cowjp)
sees active exchange of information about different spaces and events. People
are constantly sharing their discoveries on nomad working, as can be seen by
[@TakuyaKawai](http://twitter.com/#!/TakuyaKawai/status/127025407483580419)‘s
tweet:

> マクドナルド六本木ヒルズ店1階はノマドワーカーの超穴場。ﾎﾞｿｯ

Hey, the McDonalds on the first floor of Roppongi Hills towers is an untapped
haven for nomad workers.

The affinity with the Internet doesn't end with sharing information. On the
Japanese crowdfunding platform [Campfire](http://www.penn-
olson.com/2011/06/08/campfire-kickstarter-of-japan/), [co-ba](http://camp-
fire.jp/projects/view/92) recently raised funds to start their space, while
Jelly Jelly Cafe procured decent chairs with [a project](http://camp-
fire.jp/projects/view/67) [ja] called “Save Our Ass”.

The relaunch of the mutli-social media client Crowy was [a direct fruit of
connections and collaborations](http://asiajin.com/blog/2011/10/07/crowy-

> Today's big refresh happened because of a fortunate encounter this August.

Kenji904 recently set up shop in [PAX Coworking](http://pax.coworking.jp/),
the space adjunct to Paxi House. While coworking spaces are normally
associated with freelancers, he opened a Tokyo sales office for his Aichi
Prefecture based company that offers printing services for cloth material.

–

> ・情報の最先端は東京にあるし、規模が大きい  
>  ・ITやWEBの知識がこれからは必ず必須になる  
>  ・競合から奪うのではなく、新規事業や新規業界を創る事が大切  
>  ・デザイナーやWEB業界などとコラボレーションは重要

– The speed and quality of information in Tokyo is the best, and the scale is
incomparable  
– Knowledge about information technology and the web is becoming indispensable  
– It's important to focus on creating new businesses instead of fighting with
competitors  
– It's important to collaborate with designers and the web industry

on the idea:

>
> 何気なく自分の求めているゆるい人との繋がりを産み出してくれるのがコワーキングスペースなのかなと思っています。リアル版のゆるい繋がりをうむSNS的なイメージです。  
>
> そこにはその場所のマスター的なカタリスト（触媒）の人がいて、最初はいろいろ場所を形成してくれています。なので、初めて参加しても、何となくみんなが受け入れてくれるような場所の雰囲気が出来上がっています。  
>  そして何回か行くうちにそこにいる人みんながそれぞれ触媒になっていく感じを最近感じています。

Coworking spaces enable the casual relationships that we are unconsciously
searching for. I think of it as the real world version of social network
services.  
In each coworking space is the [space
catalyst](http://wiki.coworking.info/w/page/16583958/SpaceCatalyst), who is
like the head bartender. S/he shapes the culture of the space in the early
stages, leading to a welcoming atmosphere for all newbies. By the time you've
gone there a few times, everyone evolves into a catalyst in their own right.
