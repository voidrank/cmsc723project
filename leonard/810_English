You might wonder what reactions can a music video cause? R&B singer-songwriter
[Akon's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akon) (born Aliaune Badara Akon Thiam)
video [Sexy Chick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzNR9c82XLg), which features
a group of scantly clad women dancing at a pool party in front of a Buddha
statue, caused much uproar in Sri Lanka. The statue in question is in the
background for a few seconds and is out of focus and barely visible.

Akon was scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on a concert tour next month. A couple
of days ago approximately 200 people gathered outside the office of Maharaja,
the broadcaster sponsoring the concert, and [hurled
stones](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ia4ejAqN9MT6G7PaUNDg10HXEVsgD9EKA1600)
injuring four people and damaging the building.

Online news portal _Perambara_
[reports](http://perambara.org/featured/2010/03/confusion-over-akon-gig):

> Online opposition to the concert which started in the form of Facebook
> groups, has now grown to almost 13,000 in numbers, and is being supported by
> forwarded emails and blog posts. The verbal opposition took a violent twist
> on March 22, when the offices of Capital Maharaja came under attack by a
> mob. Placards left behind at the scene indicated that the attack was
> triggered by the proposed Akon concert.

This did not stop there and according to [a news
report](http://entertainment.oneindia.in/music/international/2010/sri-lanka-
visa-akon-250310.html) some Buddhist monks approached the Sri Lankan
government urging not to allow Akon to perform in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan
government [turned down Akorn's visa
request](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/25/akon-sri-lanka-buddha-
statue) citing his: “controversial video images, offensive song lyrics and
strong protests coming from various cultural, religious groups and
organizations in the country”.

Akon issued [a statement](http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/akon-
apologises-for-video-controversy-in-sri-lanka_1136588) saying that he was not
aware of the statue and did not mean to offend.

This has become a hot topic in the Sri Lankan blogosphere.

_Indrajit Samarajiva_ at _Indi.ca_ finds the video annoying but
[criticizes](http://indi.ca/2010/03/fundamentalism-and-superficialism/) the
attacks:

> If you want to defend Buddhism one might start by practicing it. Rather than
> chatting on Facebook or (allegedly) throwing stones, that involves a little
> sitting quietly by yourself.

_Dee_ at _A Collision of Ideas_ [slams the death threat to
Akon](http://mathawaada.blogspot.com/2010/03/kill-akon-really.html) in
Facebook and suggests:

> Perhaps we need to be a little less angry, give it a chance and see what
> positives we can get out of it rather than killing him and embarrassing
> ourselves all together.

_Kalana Senaratne_ at _Groundviews_ [names this the rise of Sinhala-Buddhist
fundamentalism](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/03/25/aroused-by-
akon%E2%80%99s-sexy-bitch-the-rise-of-sinhala-buddhist-fundamentalism/):

> Surely, if one or two seconds caused such anger and hatred, things would
> have been much more serious if the entire music video featured a Buddha
> statue or a temple in it. More fundamentally, then, are these protesters who
> shout and scream and throw stones, including some monks, really ‘Buddhists’?
>
> Perhaps as a nation, we have reached the stage where the kind of absurd
> protests that take place in the name Buddhism need to be critically
> analyzed. There is a great danger in not doing so, because obviously, the
> impression that is sent out by the silence of those who are disturbed by
> such protests is that of ‘acceptance’; acceptance of every barbaric thing

> religions.

_Going Global_ [has this to
say](http://abdulhalik.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/instead-ofkilling-akon/) to
the Akon haters in Sri Lanka:

> All accusations these kill Akon groups level against him centre around a
> Buddha statue used in a video of his. Now i understand how that can be
> offensive; to have a couple of scantily clad ‘ho’s’ dancing around something
> you consider to be sacred, and if someone did that in a mosque I’d be pretty
> pissed off too.
>
> But going berserk on the news that he is to perform in Sri Lanka and
> threatening to kill the guy is not going to help anyone. Least of all the
> Sri Lankans.

_A Voice in Colombo_ [asks](http://landlikenoother.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-
akon-understands-well-and-indi-few.html) “is it ok for producers of the music
video, to use a Buddha statue in the backdrop of that video?” _London, Lanka
and Drums_ [answers the
question](http://londonlanka.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-would-buddha-
think.html) and wonders what God or Buddha would think about the matter.

_The Puppeteer_ has [this to
say](http://messiahofmadness.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/lets-hope-its-just-a-
hitch/) about the refusal of Akon's visa:

> The Sri Lankan government seems to have developed a habit of refusing visas.
> Though this time around it might have been a precautionary measure, rather
> than an attempt to cover up their tracks.

However the blogger hopes that Akon will perform at a rescheduled date.
