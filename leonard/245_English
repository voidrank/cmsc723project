Singapore’s [MediaCorp](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/), Thailand’s _[The
Nation](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/)_ , and Malaysia’s _[Berita
Harian](http://www.bharian.com.my/)_ – all belonging to mainstream media in
their respective countries – were forced to apologize to the public for
publishing ‘insensitive’ articles about the [Japan earthquake/tsunami
disaster](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/).

MediaCorp’s [email](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2011/03/japan-got-earthquake-
quickly-book-your-cna-commercial-slots-now.html) to advertisers, sent a few
hours after the Japan quake, was leaked in the internet

MediaCorp owns TV network Channel NewsAsia, which is dominant in Singapore. Mr
Edwin Koh, Senior Vice-President, Marketing & Sales Planning,
[issued](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2011/03/mediacorp-says-sorry-for-cna-
japan-earthquake-email.html) this apology after the controversial email became
public:

> “We apologize unreservedly if we had been seen to be insensitive to the
> gravity of the situation. The staff concerned has been counseled to be more
> circumspect; we hope the public will be forgiving and we can focus our
> attention and efforts on the affected victims of this most unfortunate
> tragedy.”

_The Nation_ , an English broadsheet in Bangkok, published this cartoon
featuring the Grim Reaper immediately after the quake/tsunami tragedy in
Japan.

The
[paper](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/03/15/opinion/Apology-30150917.html)
apologized after readers complained about the cartoon

> This is to express our sincerest apology for Tuesday paper's editorial
> cartoon that many find improper or insensitive due to its overzealous
> depiction of the tsunami as killer waves and linkage to Japan.
>
> The Nation deeply regrets the fact that the cartoon, which followed the
> artist's other work in which he shared his grief with the Japanese
> earthquake and tsunami victims, has offended several readers.
>
> The Nation always cherishes freedom of expression on our op-ed pages.
> However, every issue is different in nature and we promise to treat each
> properly, with full ethics and professionalism.

The cartoonist, [Stephff](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/Cartoon-not-
meant-to-cause-offence-30150968.html) (Stephane Peray), also apologized

> As the author of the cartoon published on Tuesday, March 15 in The Nation, I
> would like to sincerely apologise to all readers of The Nation, especially
> Japanese readers, if the image caused offence.
>
> Any offence caused was totally unintended as I always try to be careful when
> I draw about natural catastrophies. I did this particular cartoon in a hurry
> after The tsunami on Friday and we weren't quite aware of the full extent of
> the tragedy at that time. The Grim Reaper is not meant to be understood as a
> humorous character and is often used in editorial cartoons in the West to
> signify a tragedy involving loss of life. But I quite agree that on this
> occasion this cartoon was inappropriate and something softer should have
> been used. Once again I apologise to those who felt hurt by this cartoon and
> particularly to the Japanese expatriates in Thailand. No insensitivity was
> ever intended.

The cartoon published by Malaysian paper _Berita Harian_ featuring the
Japanese TV icon Ultraman immediately generated criticism in the internet

cartoon-375x279.jpg)](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

The paper
[apologized](http://www.facebook.com/bhonline/posts/10150157730020600) on its
social network sites

> “We
> [apologise](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/3/14/nation/8262608&sec=nation)
> for the publication of the cartoon in Berita Minggu. We had no intention of
> poking fun at the disaster that has befallen the nation of Japan and its
> people.
>
> “In fact, we greatly sympathise with their plight and share the sorrow of
> the Japanese people,”

A [petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/bharian/petition.html) was
circulated by Malaysian netizens condemning the cartoon. Blogger _universal_ ,
from Malaysia, thinks that an [apology is not
enough](http://billyuniversal.blogspot.com/2011/03/stupid-berita-harian.html)

> How other country is going to view us when they pick up this news?!
> Tasteless and absolutely pathetic!! Poking fun at people's misfortune is not
> funny at all, and make urself like a dumb clown.
>
> An apology is not good enough. People have to learn how to be accountable
> for their wrong doing and not be protected all the time. This is a very
> serious mistake; it is insulting to the Japanese and also brings shame to
> the whole nation.

_The ‘Tao’ of Teoism_ , from Singapore, is [not
satisfied](http://teoism.blogspot.com/2011/03/japan-quake-too-little-too-late-
for.html) with the apology issued by MediaCorp

> It is a sad, opportunistic and demeaning email that was send over the
> approval of their marketing team, and THIS IS THE BEST APOLOGY THEY CAN COME
> OUT WITH? You probably hanged a junior staff member out to dry, while
> conveniently ignoring the fact that such emails have to go out with the
> approval of the senior management? I can't believe that an email like this
> was not vetted by management before release. Shouldn't their management be
> held accountable too? In other countries, the manager in charge of this will
> probably have been demoted or sacked but cos this this high and mighty
> Mediacorp, the only action taken is “counseling for the staff concerned?”
> WTF is this???

_Life in rural Thailand_ notes that in the past, newspaper editors [would not
be quick](http://memock.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/japan-tsunami-cartoon-
insensitive-or-not/) to apologize over similar matters

> I think people get confused with the word cartoon. Some people think all
> cartoons are meant to be funny. They are not. A cartoon drawing can also
> represent current public figures or issues symbolically.
>
> One thing I am know is that you can never please everybody in the newspaper
> game, never ever. Editors these days are too quick to apologise and pander
> to the whim of politicians and social commentators. In my day we would only
> ever apologise if we got the facts wrong. These two papers I just mentioned
> did not get the facts wrong, they simply showed the facts in a different
> format – but were they really that insensitive?

_The Lost Boy_ [criticizes](http://whatismatt.com/a-step-too-far/) _The
Nation_

> The Nation is often criticized. I regularly lay into some of the WTFs that
> grace the paper's FUBAR-laden website, but I don't think anything has ever
> made me question The Nation's integrity like this editorial cartoon from
> yesterday.
