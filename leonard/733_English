Citizens of Mexico are in shock over the unexpected deaths of two Mexicans as
a result of two separate clashes with the United States Border Patrol. These
incidents occurred less than a month apart: [the brutal attack of Anastacio
Hernández
[es]](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/06/10/index.php?section=politica&article=005n2pol),
a Mexican worker who lived in California for 20 years, in the international
crossing of [San Ysidro-
Tijuana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ysidro,_San_Diego,_California), and
[the shooting of 15-year-old Sergio Adrián Hernández in the border of El Paso-
Ciudad Juárez [es]](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/686149.html). The
similarity of the two deaths have provided new grounds for citizen media to
evaluate the actions of the Mexican government towards the United States in
terms of migration and foreign policy.

[Newspaper _La Jornada_ reported
[es]](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/06/10/index.php?section=politica&article=005n2pol)
that Anastacio Hernández was beaten up on May 28 by the Border Patrol in the
international crossing of San Ysido-Tijuana, after he was apprehended because
he lacked migration documents. He was a Mexican worker who lived in California
for 20 years, where he fathered his children. [_La Jornada_ also says
[es]](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/06/10/index.php?section=politica&article=005n2pol)
that about 20 officers from the Border Patrol used both physical force and
stun guns against the worker, provoking cerebral death; one day later,
Anastacio died.

The brutal attack on Anastacio Hernández was recorded on video with a
cellphone by a student from California who was at the border at the time. The
video can be viewed [on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mLL6g8B9pw&feature=player_embedded).
The student, [a witness that will be declaring on Anastacio's case according
to CNN Mexico](http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/10/un-testigo-de-
golpiza-a-anastasio-hernandez-hara-declaracion-en-san-diego), told newspapers
that Anastacio was handcuffed all the time and never resisted to the patrol
officers.

The situation for Sergio Adrián Hernández was similar to Anastacio's in many
ways, with the exception that he was in Mexican territory when he was killed.
[CNN Mexico reported that
[es]](http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/06/10/testimonio-de-la-muerte-de-un-
adolescente-en-la-frontera-mexico-eu) on June 7, Sergio and other three
persons threw rocks at the Border Patrol officers after they were caught
sneaking into the border. In the struggle, the police shot Sergio in the head,
an act they described as “self-defense”.

[A clip from a news program replays a
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRFETM86uAk&feature=player_embedded) of
Sergio and others trying to cross the border and the response from the Border
Patrol.

Both deaths are a reflection of the tension between Mexico and the United
States after [the controversial immigration law S.B.
1070](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/30/usa-rallying-cries-for-
immigration-reform/), approved in late April by the state of Arizona in the
United States. [The law states](http://documents.nytimes.com/the-arizona-
immigration-law?ref=politics) that under reasonable suspicion that a person is
residing unlawfully in the United States, “a reasonable attempt” shall be made
by law enforcement to determine the immigration status of the person. After
much criticism that this law would lead to racial profiling, changes were made
to the wording so that law enforcement cannot consider race, color or national
origin as a factor in implementing this law.

Reflecting on the two clashes between Mexican citizens and Border Patrol
agents, blogger Franz from _El Arcangelino_ [considers the relationship
between the countries as a very delicate
matter](http://elarcangelino.blogspot.com/2010/06/del-joven-sergio-adrian-
anastacio-y-la.html ):

> El hecho de que los americanos estén respondiendo de esta manera nos habla
> de que se está radicalizando la protección fronteriza de los vecinos hasta
> las consecuencias más severas.

The fact that the Americans responded this way speaks to us about the
radicalization of our neighbor's border protection up to the most severe
consequences.

Although the Mexican government [has condemned the actions that caused the
death of Anastacio and Sergio
[es]](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/686737.html), and demanded a
thorough investigation of the events, citizens recognize that the reaction
from Mexican officials towards the issue of immigration is still condescending
and weak, as blogger TRC [criticized
[es]](http://juantadeo.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/%C2%BFque-esta-pasando-en-la-
frontera-norte-2-muertes-violentas-en-menos-de-10-dias-a-manos-de-autoridades-
migratorias/) in his blog:

> A la luz de estos indignantes acontecimientos no nos queda más que
> preguntarnos ¿hasta cuándo mantendrá la SRE [Secretaría de Relaciones
> Exteriores] una política exterior condescendiente (por no decir agachona)?
> ¿Cuándo se tomará una represalia pacífica pero contundente contra los EUA
> por los actos de racismo y discriminación que viven día a día los mexicanos
> de los más bajos estratos sociales que radican en la frontera norte? ¿Cuándo
> entenderá Patricia Espinosa [Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores] que un
> “tibio” comunicado no es una reacción suficiente ante la sistemática y
> reiterada violación de derechos fundamentales contra mexicanos por parte del
> país vecino?

In the light of these shameful events there is nothing left but to ask
ourselves, until when will the SRE (Foreign Policy Secretary) have a
condescending foreign policy (not to say submissive)? When will a peaceful but
convincing reprisal be made against thee US for their acts of racism and
discrimination lived daily by the Mexicans of the lowest social spheres that
live in the Northern border? When will Patricia Espinosa [Secretary of Foreign
Policy] understand that a “warm” press release is not enough of a reaction
reaction against the systematic and reiterative violation of the fundamental
rights of Mexicans by the neighbor country?

On the other hand, blogger Daniel Muñoz [believes that what happened to
Sergio, who was killed in Mexican territory, brings a complete new set of
circumstances [es]](http://danielopsky.blogspot.com/2010/06/el-patio-trasero-
nunca-mas.html) within the context of Mexico's foreign policy to the United
States:

> Creo que el gobierno mexicano debe hacer a niveles internacionales, lo que
> comúnmente conocemos como un “señor pancho”, si la violación a nuestra
> frontera y peor aún, el asesinato de un civil en suelo mexicano, no es
> motivo para levantar la voz, entonces resignémonos a ser el eterno patio
> trasero norteamericano, aquel concepto que Aguilar Zinser inventó
> acertadamente siendo embajador de la ONU.

I think the Mexican government needs to “cause a ruckus” [out of the event] at
international levels, if the violation of our border, and even worst, the
murder of a civilian in Mexican territory, is not a reason to speak out, then
let's resign ourselves to be the eternal backyard of the Unites States, that
concept so appropiately created by Aguilar Zinser when he was a UN ambassador.

For blogger Roberto from _La borla del Hombligo_ , [Sergio's death is a
reminder [es]](http://www.laborladelombligo.net/2010/06/08/muerte-de-
anastasio-y-sergio-adrian-responsabilidades-compartidas/) of all the young
people that are vulnerable to bullets from drug traffickers in their own
country and from their neighbors, the Border Patrol:

> No, Sergio no murió cruzando la frontera, Sergio murió en su país y ahora su
> país tendrá que ver por él.

No, Sergio did not die crossing the border, Sergio died in his country and now
his country will have to respond for him.

Finally, following the fondness Mexicans have for using parody and humor even
in the most difficult of situations, Twitter user Miguel Burgos
([@burdolab](http://twitter.com/burdolab)) joined the protest under the
hashtag [#MurderPatrol](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23murderpatrol),
[referring to Sergio's death with a parody version of a biblical phrase
[es]](http://twitter.com/burdolab/status/15848591587):

> El que esté libre de #murderpatrol que arroje la primera piedra

He who is without the #murderpatrol cast the first stone
