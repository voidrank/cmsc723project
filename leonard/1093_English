On 4 October 2009 the Timorese online media [TimorOhin](http://timortoday.com/
"TimorToday Main Website") [Tet.] [TimorToday], reported that an old border
dispute between Indonesia and East Timor has flared up once again in the
[Oecusse Enclave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oecussi-Ambeno "Wikepedia on
Oecusse").

Broadcasting a radio report in the Tetun language from Candidus Elu of Radio
Atoni Oecusse, TimorToday reported that;

> Polisia fronteira detein TNI nain 9 tama illegal iha Oe-Cusse [Tet.]

Border police detains 9 TNI [Indonesian Army] for illegal entry into Oe-Cusse.

The full story has an MP3 file which can be downloaded via the TimorOhin
website [here](http://timortoday.com/audio/polisia-fronteira-detein-tni-
nain-9-tama-illegal-iha-oe-cusse/ "TimorToday Radio Report on Timor /
Indonesia Border Dispute").

It has also been picked up by blogger
[TimorNewsNetwork](http://timornewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2009/10/polisia-
fronteira-detein-tni-nain-9.html "Timor News Network on Naktuka") as well. On
5 October, the weekly [Tempo
Semanal](http://temposemanaltimor.blogspot.com/2009/10/tni-enter-oecusse-
enclave-border.html "Tempo Semanal Headline "Indonesian TNI Enter Illegally
into Naktuka Timorese Angry"") blogged an internet feature out of it.

TimorOhin provides a service for previously unheard journalists from the far
reaches of Timor-Leste to report to the nation at large, Timorese, abroad, and
the international community.

In the story Radio Atoni Oecusse reporter Elu explains that the community of
border village Naktuka in Subdistrict Nitibe, working with the Timorese Border
Police detained 9 members of the Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI) for illegal
entry into Timor-Leste on 3 October 2009.

Google Maps shows a missing border

Radio Atoni Oecusse quotes Simao de Carvalho, Chefe Suco (village head) of
Ben-Ufe (within which Naktuka is located), as saying that the TNI entered
Timor-Leste at 0900 with military vehicles and that they were armed. However,
by 1400 Timorese National Police Headquarters in Dili instructed local
authorities to release the TNI and allow them to return to Indonesia. Radio
Atoni Oecusse quotes local youth as being upset that Timorese are jailed for
illegal border crossings but not the Indonesian Army. Local police have
explained to residents that the border area remains disputed and that decision
to release the TNI came from the highest levels in Dili.

This is an old border dispute. Both the [Dili
Insider](http://thediliinsider.blogspot.com/search/label/naktuka "Dili Insider
on the Naktuka Border Issue \(Maps Included\)") and [East Timor Law and
Justice Bulletin](http://easttimorlegal.blogspot.com/2009/06/indonesian-
military-told-to-evict-east.html "East Timor Law and Justice on Naktuka Border
Dispute") blogs carried news about a brewing problem in June 2009. At stake is
a rice paddy complex in contested land, in addition to a betel nut forest
which has significant traditional “[adat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adat
"Wikipedia on Adat")” importance to people across the Oecusse Enclave.

The dispute predates June and is part of a wider set of border issues in the
Enclave. Most notably, after a [show of force by the TNI](http://www.the-
islomaniac.com/2007/01/indonesia-east-timor-battle-over.html "Fighter Jet and
Gunboat Shell and Bomb Oecusse 2004"), including a fighter jet and a gunboat
in January 2004, Timor-Leste ceded ownership of the island Pulau Batek, or
Fatu Sinai as it is known in Oecusse, to Indonesia in 2005. Public opinion in
the Enclave was resigned frustration mixed with a refusal to cede Naktuka if
asked.

Significantly, this is not the first time that TNI have been detained in this
area. During the Fatu Sinai / Batek spat, Timorese police detained TNI in the
same area.

In June Indonesian blogger [berita hankam](http://beritahankam.blogspot.com/)
posted a story in which [TNI border commander Lt.Col.
Yunianto](http://beritahankam.blogspot.com/2009/06/warga-timor-leste-langgar-
perjanjian.html "TNI Commander on Border Dispute") is quoted as saying,

> TNI hanya bertugas menjaga keamanan dan pertahanan negara. Sehingga kami
> tidak bisa masuk ke wilayah yang diduduki untuk mengusir warga Timor Leste
> tersebut. Kami sudah menyampaikan protes keras kepada polisi penjaga
> perbatasan Timor Leste,” lanjutnya. [Bahasa]

TNI's only duty is the security and defence of the country. So we do not go
into the area which is the responsibility of someone else to order the
Timorese community out. We already sent a strong protest to the Timorese
border police.

Close Up of Naktuka Area – from Dili Insider

Some important people on the Indonesian side of the border have spoken
publicly and aggressively over the matter of who owns Naktuka. The Dili
Insider reveals that [Robby
Manoh](http://thediliinsider.blogspot.com/2009/09/liurai-of-amfoan-picks-
fight.html "King of Amfoan - Robby Manoh"), quoted by the Jakarta Globe saying
“if this injustice continues, we have no choice but to force”, is actually the
King of Amfoan community – across the border from Naktuka.

Indonesian blogger Radio Sahabat reported that Manoh had again [raised the
issue of Naktuka](http://radiosahabat.blogspot.com/2009/09/suatu-saat-pulau-
batek-bisa-diklaim.html "Radio Sahabet Blog on Manoh and Naktuka") with the
Governor of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province less than a month ago.

Interestingly, with the case of [Maternus
Bere](http://www.laohamutuk.org/Justice/99/bere/LHBere24Sep.htm "Timorese NGO
Lao Hamutuk"), former pro-Indonesia militia commander penned up in the
Indonesian Embassy, in addition to recent [tri-lateral security and
development meeting between Indonesian, Australia and Timor-
Leste](http://timortoday.com/audio/mne-timor-leste-indonesia-no-australia-
hala%E2%80%99o-enkontru-trilateral-deskuti-kona-ba-seguransa-no-
desemvolvimentu/ "Tri-Lateral - Jakarta, Canberra, Dili.") – Indonesia is
putting pressure on Dili via one of its soft spots. The soft spot being Dili's
60,000 citizens in the enclave in Indonesian West Timor – Oecusse.
