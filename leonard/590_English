Hanoi is 1,000 years old. The
[festivities](http://my.opera.com/thanglonghanoi1000years/albums/show.dml?id=4772472?&abc=&page=2&skip=20&show=&perscreen=20)
to mark the historic occasion lasted for ten days from October 1-10. Bloggers
share their observations and reactions about how the events were organized.

[Aaron Joel Santos](http://aaronjoelsantos.wordpress.com/2010/10/01/hanoi-
vietnam-count-to-a-thousand/) describes the scenes in Hanoi during the first
day of the celebrations

> Hanoi is turning 1,000 years old. In 10 days. But the festivities began this
> morning. Officially at 8am but by the time I left my house at 7.30 the
> streets were already an orderly mess. Roads blocked, traffic diverted,
> people hoarded, “No Entry” signs planted…This morning I headed into the
> maelstrom. And it was fun.
>
> Everyone was in a good mood. I’ve made fun of these celebrations along with
> everyone else for I don’t even know how long, but in the end, a lot of
> locals seem very excited about it.

_[Vietnam Adventures](http://teamfroz.blogspot.com/2010/10/hanoi-1000-year-
celebrations.html)_ blogs about the preparations for the event

> So far from what I have seen, lights have been put up throughout the city,
> mainly on Dien Bien Phu Street and between West and Truc Back Lake. The
> lights are a big attraction at night and the streets are packed. A lot of
> work has gone into Ba Dinh square, in front of the HCM Mausoleum, where many
> of the celebrations will take place. Traditional performances occur on
> stages on the side of the road; I passed one on my way home from work with
> about 100 motorbikes stopped, watching on.

[Ehrin Macksey](http://www.blog.ehrinmacksey.com/2010/10/10/3-hours-of-
hanois-1000-years/) narrates the activities during the Sunday anniversary

> Girls dressed up in Ao Dai, event workers shifting out propaganda posters
> and military personal dotted the area around the mausoleum. People visiting
> from the countryside came to see what their capital had prepared for them on
> Sunday’s anniversary. Vietnamese people are at heart very kind and easy
> going people. I really had a great time walking, talking to them, having my
> photo taken with them and of course taking snap here and there. The only
> thing that was a little bothersome was all the police being rude and forcing
> people from watching the preparation of the parade from the street.

[Amy Gottlieb](http://amygottlieb.net/archives/969) notes the impact of
Hanoi’s 1,000th birthday, historically known as Thang Long, on the residents
of the city

> Granted, I must admit – even with the disastrous traffic, the incessant road
> blocks, and the influx of tourists, the spirit of the city is contagious!
> The energy is palpable, as streets are abuzz; and people appear happier, in
> good spirits, and in festive moods.

Using the [#hanoi1000](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23hanoi1000)
hashtag, here are some twitter reactions:

> @benjaminbland: I've never seen so many Vietnamese clutching maps: proof

>  [dragfyre](http://twitter.com/dragfyre/statuses/26942634774): watching the

[Steve Jackson](http://ourmaninhanoi.com/2010/10/10/happy-birthday-
hanoi-%E2%80%93-i-love-you-and-miss-you-hanoi1000/) observes that many twitter
posts reflect cynicism and disappointment of several netizens about how the
events were organized.

> The style of the celebrations may be questionable but this is a truly
> remarkable capital. However, I doubt I’m the only one who will be happy to
> see the end of #hanoi1000. I’ve really felt like I’ve missed the place over
> the last ten days.

> Happy birthday Hanoi, I’m looking forward to seeing you get back to your old
> self.

[Philip Arthur
Moore](http://life.philiparthurmoore.com/post/1280027498/hanois-1000th-
birthday-morning) points to the images indicating the 1,000th birthday party
of Hanoi

> Helicopters, people on rooftops, empty alleyways; sounds about right for
> Hanoi’s 1000th birthday party. I doubt I will go anywhere other than my
> balcony today. Crowds have a history of driving me mad, and if the last nine
> days have been any indication, Hanoi’s Old Quarter will be absolute bedlam
> for the next 18 hours

Referring to the deadly [fireworks
explosion](http://www.dailyvietnamnews.net/2010/Pages/20101008122238.aspx) a
few days before the main event and the
[flooding](http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/201010/Flood-hits-Central-
Vietnam-leaving-85-dead-missing-940062/) in central Vietnam, [Andy
Engelson](http://www.onlyok.net/?p=1197) explains further why he was not too
much enthusiastic with the celebrations

> I tried to muster up the enthusiasm to go take some photos or attended
> events. But I couldn’t do it. The much-anticipated gala, in my opinion, was
> a huge bust. A fiasco. I’m happy it’s over. Can we all get back on with our
> lives, now?
>
> Maybe it’s the completely boring series of events scheduled. I’m sorry, I’m
> just not into entertainment in the form of revolutionary film festivals,
> blaring patriotic music, and traffic jams. Did I mention traffic jams? I was
> happy miss the one yesterday the one that kept the president of Vietnam
> sitting in his motorcade for five hours. Hope he had a minibar

criticizes the event planners

> I've already expressed my disappointment leading into the celebration, the
> lack or organization, the lack of inclusion of the foreign community, both
> locally and internationally. And in this past week of celebrations, I have
> grown even more so. Some would say that the expats are being too negative
> and looking for bad things to say. But I'll tell ya…when a city turns 1000
> years old, and you don't tell anybody how you are planning to celebrate or
> what festivities they can attend, when you don't even tell them what days
> they may not be able to get to their place of work due to road closures or
> close so many streets that the already insane traffic becomes monstrous,
> well then…I don't have a hell of a lot of sympathy. It's poor event planning
> and it's laughable.

_Viet Tan_ used the occasion to
[dramatize](http://www.viettan.org/spip.php?article10403) their concern about
the political and human rights situation in the country

> Participants, from within Vietnam and overseas, passed out fliers, t-shirts
> and hats affirming Vietnamese sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly
> Islands. This [civic action](http://www.viettan.org/spip.php?article10405)
> to raise public awareness is the latest effort by Viet Tan to promote
> Vietnamese national interests and advocate for social justice and democratic
> change through open and peaceful political activities.

muses about the need to protect Hanoi’s future
