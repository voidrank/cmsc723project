In a previous [post](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/12/what-future-
for-ict4d/), we investigated the future of ICT4D from a pretty high level. In
this post, I am going to look at some of the new tools that individuals,
groups, companies and governments can use to develop new projects around
information and communication technologies.

Our underlying theme is investigating how ICTs affect human development. There
are many who argue that connection to the internet and/or mobile phone
technologies will increase people’s participation in government, in economies,
in education and thus increase their standard of living.

Technology and access to internet has advanced so much in the past years, that
some will argue that there is no longer a question of whether people in remote
areas will soon communicate online. Rather, we should talk about what forms of
communication will take place.

The UK-based blog _Mainstreaming ICT_ , says the time to integrate the [mobile
phone and the computer](http://mainstreamingict.org/2009/06/technology-for-
social-change-social-good-community-mobile-channels/) is now.

**Low bandwidth? No problem**

One major problem facing internet users in the developing world is the
combination of slow connectivity (or, interrupted connections) and graphic-
intensive websites. News websites and social networking sites are often the
worst offenders.
([Here’s](http://www.web2fordev.net/component/content/article/1-latest-
news/69-social-networks) a nice rundown on the popularity of various social
networking sites in Africa and Asia.)

Christian Kreutz at the blog _Crisscrossed_ has a theory that many of the
world’s languages have not been widely translated for applications, because so
many people can’t read popular websites. The reason? Page load times are too
long for people with questionable connections.

Here's a few [examples](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2009/04/14/what-does-
local-content-have-to-do-with-low-bandwidth-applications/):

> In a cybercafe, where you have to pay fees per minute, it may take up to 3

The blog _Aid Worker Daily_ , based out of the US, has found a
[solution](http://aidworkerdaily.com/2009/02/16/the-loband-option/) to viewing
these slow-loading websites:

_Crisscrossed_ lists other products for low-bandwidth
[connections](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2009/04/14/what-does-local-content-

Full disclosure: Maneno, the multi-lingual, low-bandwidth blogging platform,
is in part run by three Global Voices authors.

blogging-platform-built-for-african-bloggers/) is a GV post about it.

**Micro-blogging for fun and profit**

People like micro-blogging, popularized through sites like Twitter and the
business-oriented Yammer, because it is fast and relatively low-bandwidth.
It’s quicker and easier than email and often even more informal. Micro-
blogging has changed the way groups conduct [crisis
management](http://aidworkerdaily.com/2009/03/25/why-microblogging-might-
prove-a-good-fit-for-aid-agencies/), [event
coverage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/13/iran-storm-of-protest-
after-election/) and issue advocacy.

But not everyone wants to attempt to micro-blog on the big sites because of
the lack of privacy. There are a number of technologies that allow
organizations to put micro-blogging to their own use to facilitate community
building online.

Louis Gray, a US-based blogger,
[explains](http://blog.louisgray.com/2008/08/identica-and-power-of-
microbranded.html) the federated platform of Laconi.ca, which he describes as
a “group Twitter” – speaking to a distinct community rather than to the whole
world.

> Well, actually, it's more of a small community concept I'm refering to –
> your business can actually build communities off of this protocol, starting
> with the software that Identi.ca has provided. Identi.ca and Twitter are
> both very broad communities. People of all types and tastes are on those
> services. Those services are good for that – it's a great way to build
> relationships, meet new people, and find information. However, there is no
> way currently for me to associate only with those of like tastes and
> culture. For instance, if I am into college football and you are not, you
> aren't going to be interested in the details of the games I'm watching….
>
> Now, what if [the US-based sports network] [ESPN](http://espn.go.com/) were
> to launch a version of Laconi.ca just for sports lovers? It would just take
> a simple install of Laconi.ca and a little cobranding of their logo, look,
> and feel and soon an entire community of sports lovers would be sharing
> their love for sports, communicating back and forth, and showing their other
> sports-loving friends what they're doing in their sports-loving life. At the
> same time, they could still follow all of those same friends they follow
> over on Identi.ca and even other interest communities, all while still on
> the ESPN sports community, remaining on the ESPN site. Imagine if this same
> technique was launched for Moms, Dads, religions, or even just your local
> city or town?

**My mobile phone, my friend**

The last post in this series began with the argument that we need to update
the old story of the fisherman using his mobile phone to find the highest
prices for his product. Back to the blog _Crisscrossed_ ,
[here](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2009/05/11/mobile-activism-in-africa/) is
an update on what makes the mobile phone so important.

> It is so special because it combines all former media, such as telephone,
> Internet, and even radio and television, and because one can:  
>  1\. Communicate and receive information (radio, television and Internet)  
>  2\. Document and collect information  
>  3\. Publish information in text, audio and video  
>  4\. Can network in different ways on a peer-to-peer basis

He also noted the mobile phone will help shape the public sphere by allowing
citizen [journalists to take
photos](http://voicesofafrica.africanews.com/site/Guinness_factory_pollutes_water_sources/list_messages/21566).
Phones allow people to participate in radio programs and through SMS-based
campaigns. And they allow people to [monitor
elections](http://www.kubatana.net/html/ff/ff_cont.asp).

Patrick Meier, from the group _DigiActive_ ,
[argues](http://www.slideshare.net/iRevolution/digi-active-for-mobile-
active-2008-final-presentation) that people can now become activists simply by
using a mobile phone. Portable telephones have been employed to organize and
coordinate protests – specifically in the Philippines, Spain and Pakistan.
Mobile phones have also been used to document human rights abuses, in Egypt,
Tibet and Morocco.

But problems do exist. The cost of SMS communication is very high, [especially
in Africa](http://afromusing.com/2009/10/09/its-2009-mobile-costs-should-be-
lower-yes-its-a-bit-of-a-rant/). Mobile networks can be controlled by the
government, Kreutz says. And, mobile providers are in businses to make money,
not facilitate protest marches.

**Sending hundreds of SMS texts**

FrontlineSMS distributes a program allowing users to send and receive SMS
messages in large groups without having to hook up to the internet.

[Here](http://pulseandsignal.com/2009/07/17/can-your-cell-phone-change-lives/)
is a write up in the blog _Pulse + Signal_ about a FrontlineSMS project in
Malawi, where they [distributed](http://venturebeat.com/2009/09/03/phones-
deliver-doctors-orders-in-africa-with-frontlinesms/) mobile phones so doctors
in hospitals can communicate with health workers in remote villages.

> Despite all of the technological advancement surrounding these portable
> command centers of communication – all the bells and whistles that come

SMS technology.
