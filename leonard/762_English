As Ethiopians are preparing themselves for[ parliamentary
election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_general_election,_2010)
scheduled for May 23, 2010, two organisations are using new media to ensure
free and fair elections. [Ethiopia
CommonBorders](http://www.fairethiopia.org/), a community-based organisation,
uses social networking site, Facebook, as part of its campaign while [Ethiopia
Vote Monitor](http://www.ethiopiavotemonitor.org/), a pilot project by
Ethiopian civil society organisations uses a web-based platform to collect and
visualise election information on a map.

CommonBorders Facebook page is called, [“Support a Free and Fair Election in
Ethiopia.”](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=78789966124) Its page
already has 2,904 members and [23 topics
](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=78789966124&v=app_2373072738)for
discussion have been posted so far.

This is how the organisation d[escribes its mission](
http://www.fairethiopia.org/ourmission.htm) on its [official website](
http://www.fairethiopia.org/):

> Ethiopia CommonBorders is a community-based, non-partisan, non-profit
> society that coordinates electoral observer delegations. Ethiopia
> CommonBorders provides its members with the unique opportunity to experience
> and learn about democratic processes and the political environment in
> Ethiopia while serving as electoral observers.

[  
Do you expect free and fair election with existing poletical system and
channel?]( http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=78789966124&topic=9058), the
group asks its Facebook members.

A sample of responses from its members:

> True indeed, we are under the control of a stalinist tribal junta with no
> tolerance for the will and wish of the people – here is a link regarding the
> 2010 “elections”

> there's a clear definition of democracy and the concept is simple! The TPLF
> version instilled in Ethiopia is a fascism – nothin like democracy.

> There won't be a free and fair election for a bit long time, and there
> wasn't any. The miracle is one- we have to push all oppositions to go
> participate and show us what they dreamed for us, with all the fraudulent
> vote count they get. then after our question will begin– we will tell them
> to fuck off. but till then it is not time for us to side to any of them. For
> example, OLF had around 60% of the paliament's seats in 93, but when “One
> nation One Army” was signed they left the parliament hence they wanted their
> military unit to be active and that was not allowed. Just telling you– this
> illusion that they brought in the past 4 decades has to be analyzed before
> we react to ideas.

> But in Ethiopia particularly, the current regime continues to be buttressed
> by the support of the US in their war against an ideology so to see a change
> in government isn't likely right now. It's going to take the people fighting
> against this establishment.

> I look at this Ethiopian government in disgust personally, dismantling the
> ICU in Somalia and justifying it with fear mongering propaganda when it was
> a fear of conflict over Ogaden. Bottomline is that there can't possibly be
> free and fair elections if this system isn't even inclusive to all it's
> people.

[Ethiopia Vote Monitor](http://www.ethiopiavotemonitor.org/) intends to use
citizens reporting for a more transparent and accountable democracy:

Its [About Us](http://handheldhumanrights.org/ethiopia/page/index/1) page
reads in part:

> Thanks to the power of free and open source technology we can gather
> distributed data via SMS, email or web and visualize it on a map and
> timeline.
>
> Ethiopia Vote Monitor is a pilot project led by Ethiopian civil society
> organizations, with technical support from Digital Democracy utilizing the
> Ushahidi.com system.

The project intends to disseminate key information and messages to field
workers, facilitate communication between groups, collect data that can be
mapped on a public site, rapidly spread news of violence and abuses to the
international community, advocacy groups, and key actors on the ground through
new media.

Ethiopia Vote Monitor uses [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/) platform.
Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, is a website that was initially
developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout
at the beginning of 2008. The platform is free for any person or organization
who want to collect and visualize information.

Citizens can report election related incidents to Ethiopia Vote Monitor by
sending an email to ethiopia@digital-democracy.org, by sending a tweet with
the hashtag/s ethiopia or ethiopiavotereport or by filling a form at the
website.

[The project is also](http://twitter.com/VoteEthiopia) on the popular
microblogging site, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/).

The last elections in 2005 were followed by[ bloody
clashes](http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=12345) between
riot police and opposition supporters and arbitrary arrest of opposition
politicians. There are fears that the situation might be even worse this year.
An opposition candidate, Gebru Asrat, [was stabbed to
death](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-02/ethiopian-opposition-
parliamentary-candidate-stabbed-to-death.html) in March this year. Opposition
politicians claimed that his killing was part of politics of intimidation and
harassment before election day.
