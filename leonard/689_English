On June 25th 2010, Oliver Fricker, 32, was sentenced to three strokes of the
cane and five months in prison after he pleaded guilty to breaking into a
Singapore train depot last month and vandalism for spraying the words “McKoy
Banos” across two carriages (a [video of the
graffiti](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/06/14/singapore-swiss-national-
charged-over-train-vandalism/) has been widely shared in blogs and forums).

He was accompanied at the time by with a man identified as Lloyd Dane
Alexander, a Briton, who was in Singapore for just three days, according to
the prosecution. Singapore has sought the extradition of Alexander, who it
said was last believed to be in Hong Kong.

Legal and analysis blogger, [Right
Juris](http://law.rightpundits.com/?p=1860), wrote that foreigners should
abide by the rules of the country they are in:

> While not an advocate of caning, stoning and other forms of violence, I
> understand that it is necessary at times to protect the people and their
> property. No one chooses to be a victim of crime, minor or otherwise—-that
> decision is made by the criminal.

Singaporean socio-political blogger, [Kristen
Han](http://kixes.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/singapore-global-torture-hub/),
denounced the sentence as ‘completely sickening’ and labelled Singapore a
‘Global Torture Hub’ :

> It is completely sickening. I can’t believe that we are going to inflict
> such an archaic and utterly barbaric punishment for such a petty crime that
> did not even hurt anyone (and almost went undetected). It is so completely
> overblown – and I’m not saying this because he is a foreigner. It is
> completely overblown as a punishment for anyone, and it disgusts me that my
> country would do something like this to a person, and think it NECESSARY.

Singaporean blogger, [Roger
Poh](http://rogerpoh.wordpress.com/2010/06/26/smrt-vandal-oliver-fricker-gets-
jail-and-caning/), called the caning ‘demeaning and barbaric’, and also
slammed Singapore's aspirations to be a kinder and caring society:

> Caning is demeaning and barbaric, often leaving permanent scars as caning is
> inflicted on bare buttocks.
>
> Caning has no place in modern, civilised societies.
>
> Singapore from time to time makes stirring declarations that it wants to be
> a kinder and more gracious society. Unless we abolish caning, this
> aspiration is merely lip service.
