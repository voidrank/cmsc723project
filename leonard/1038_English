When [Radio Netherlands ](http://www.rnw.nl/english)broadcasted an Arabic
translation of the _Artificial Virginity Hymen kit_ , when [Youm7 newspaper
](http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=136364)announced that the product will
be available on the Egyptian market for LE 83, when conservative parliament
members in Egypted wanted [the product banned and any exporter exiled or
beheaded](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/05/egypt-fake-hymen-kit-may-
_n_309737.html), and when it caused such [an uproar in the Egyptian
blogosphere](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/08/will-egypt-import-
chinese-hymens/), [Mohamed Al Rahhal
](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/28/artificial-hymen)just
had to buy one.

As he went to retrieve his package at the post office:

> it had been opened by various puzzled customs and postal employees who, at a
> loss, defined the product in writing as “containing an unknown red liquid” –
> and awaited my description.

He told them it was “cinematographic make-up” and took the item home:

> Such is the “hymen”: a 5x7cm folded piece of plastic – of albumin, the
> notice promptly corrects me – covered on one side by dark red ink. Placed in
> the vagina before sex, the plastic hardens slightly, and rips upon
> intercourse. A few drops of “blood” will stain the sheets, preserving the
> woman's, her family's, or society's “honour”.
>
> Whether it does actually work or not I cannot answer. The complete absence
> of medical information on the product, as well as online accusations that
> this product can cause infections, made me unwilling to give it to a
> volunteer to test.

_Mona El Tahawy_ did not like how Egyptians were [hot and bothered over fake
hymens](http://www.monaeltahawy.com/blog/?p=188)With all the troubles Egypt
faces these days — spiralling cost of living, a president in power for 28
years whose son looks likely to succeed him, etc. — why all the fuss over
hymens, real or fake?

Welcome to the hypocrisy and denial that together drum at the heart of
conservative religious views on women and chastity. And in the case of Egypt,
that conservatism applies equally to Muslims and Christians.

As a Muslim, I know the Qur’an preaches chastity for men and women, but the
conservative obsession with women means only females are expected to abide by
the prohibition on extramarital sex. This obsession with virginity is shallow
at best and deadly at worst.

_Mohamed El Rahhal_ strongly condemns:

> the hypocrisy that allows us to discriminate against 50% of the society
> while giving a free pass to the other half. I am against forcing women to go
> such lengths, sometimes endangering their health, to allow us to delay a
> long-awaited national moratorium on gender relations.
>
> Morality is worst interpreted by anatomy. And if we're waiting upon a small
> piece of plastic to define morality, then we've already failed – and ought
> to find a better definition.
