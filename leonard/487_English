Serbia is a deeply divided country regarding the main orientation of its
foreign relations: while some political parties and approximately half of its
population would like to see Serbia in the European Union as soon as possible,
other politicians and citizens look toward Russia and would like their
homeland to become a Russian province, as [Tomislav
Nikolic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomislav_Nikoli%C4%87)
[said](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1076353.html) in the Parliament of
the Republic of Serbia in 2007.

The latter ones belong to the extreme political right and include various
associations of nationalists, Serbian Orthodox Church and some social groups
whose members call themselves “patriots” (such as hooligans who have recently
[demolished the center of
Belgrade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgzm9sNc__A), expressing their
“attitude” towards [the Belgrade Gay Pride
Parade](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/12/serbia-gay-pride-parade-
used-as-excuse-for-riots/), and [made riots in
Genoa](http://www.mondo.rs/motion/play.php?vid=4335), confirming their “love”
for the national football team and a high level of patriotism.

In the prime of the newest public discussion on patriotism and the origin of
violence in the Serbian society, daily Belgrade newspaper _Danas_
[wrote](http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/pucali_iz_puske_i_bacali_bombe.55.html?news_id=201741)
on Oct. 19 that two years ago, several groups of Serbian children, aged 11 to
15 years old, had spent 16 days in scout camps in Russia, where they were
being trained to assemble and dismantle weapons, to throw bombs, and to fire
rifles.

These children were sent to Russia by the [Patriotic
Front](http://www.patriotskifront.com/), an association of 1990-1999 Serbian
war veterans (the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia, including the war against NATO).

Zoran Vranesevic, general secretary of the association, said to _Danas_ that
the two groups, which consisted of 20 children of war veterans, had attended
the scout camps in Russia in order to learn about Russia’s traditions, culture
and religion, to develop their patriotic spirit and to learn to fight against
their vices.

The main goal of the Patriotic Front was not to train children in marksmanship
but to make sure that the children didn’t inherit the complexes of their
fathers, the veterans, who are marginalized by the society, Vranesevic added.

During the unusual and unique sojourn in Siberia, the children got a chance to
take part in a writing competition on a simple topic – “My stay in Russia” –
which had been announced by the hosts (primarily, the Russian patriotic
association Kosovo’s Front).

U. L. (13) wrote that Russians had given them knowledge about weapons, they
had been training them in fencing and throwing knives, teaching them how to
become skilled and persistent. He added:

> We experienced a baptism of fire in the first camp where it was the most
> difficult. We lived there close to nature, eating the new, very simple and
> unusual dishes with much fruit, bitter cheeses, washing our dishes in the
> river, taking baths in it, taking part in battles, had exercises on the
> firing range, assembling and dismantling rifles, like in the real army,
> riding horses…”

M. K. (15) described his experience in one of the three camps in which they
were staying:

> In this camp, we had various trainings over the day, such as surmounting of
> the firing range, riding horses and coming down from trees on ropes. When we
> finished those exercises we had lunch but no one liked it. However, we ate
> because we were hungry. In the evening, we were dancing traditional Cossack
> dances. The next day, we went to the rifle range where we were firing rifles
> and throwing bombs. That day I was firing so much that my ears were ringing
> for the next three days.

Psychologist Zarko Trebjesanin
[says](http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/pucali_iz_puske_i_bacali_bombe.55.html?news_id=201741)
that children should not be trained to use weapons, but to communicate
tolerantly. Military training could have very negative effects on children who
are unstable emotionally and insufficiently socialized.

Sociologist Ratko Bozovic [said
this](http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/tuzilastvo_pokrece_istragu.55.html?news_id=201818),
among other things:

> Throwing bombs and firing rifles are an attraction for the children and they
> find self-confirmation in such acts of violence.

Tamara Lukšić-Orlandić, Serbia's Deputy Ombudsman for children's rights, [
said](http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/tuzilastvo_pokrece_istragu.55.html?news_id=201818)
to _Danas_ that children should not be trained to use weapons because it is
not adequate for their ages to behave “like guerrillas.” She reminded that
Serbia had international obligations to protect children, because it is a
signatory to [the Convention on the Rights of the
Child](http://www.unicef.org/crc/). According to her, any contact of children
with weapons is not desirable, because it could have negative effects on the
development of a person.

The web site of Abrasevic Media, which is mainly focused on the analysis of
society in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country where the biggest war crimes
were committed by some ethnic Serbs, who were later sentenced in the Hague
Tribunal, [published a commentary

According to _Danas_ , Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Serbia will check
the information about the case, and if he finds any criminal elements in it,
he will act in accordance with the law.
