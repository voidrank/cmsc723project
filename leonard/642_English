More than a month after the resignation of Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal,
the [Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal)
is still without a leader. Four rounds of elections have failed to produce a
clear winner, another round is scheduled for August 18th.

blog says that the fifth round of elections is not expected to work out a
breakthrough.

The current environment of convoluted political deal making and ideology
inspired selfishness among major political parties was further complicated
when neighboring India sent its special enjoy Shyam Saran to Kathmandu.

Sharan, a former Indian Ambassador to Nepal, was widely criticized during his
tenure for allegedly meddling in country's affairs and crossing the diplomatic
line. Now that New Delhi has sent him to Kathmandu as [“Mr.
Fixit”](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/08/04/indias-new-mr-fixit-for-
nepal/), the Maoists and the right wing nationalists have found strong
ammunition to block any proposal from the Nepali Congress and Communist Party
(United Marxist and Leninist) – who are seen as favoring Sharan's visit.

Bloggers are also questioning whether India can send an envoy to discuss Nepal
internal sensitive matter, without being invited. At Nepali language blog
_[MySansar](http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2010/08/id/12590)_ , Deepak says,

> “शरण यसरी आउन मिल्छ कि मिल्दैन। धेरैले शरणलाई माओवादी र तत्कालिन सात दलबीचको

“Can Sharan come to Nepal as an envoy? Many have credited Sharan for
facilitating peace agreement between then Seven Party coalition government and
the Maoists. After arriving in Kathmandu on Wednesday he proudly stated that
he is Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's special envoy. But can a foreign
government send an envoy to its neighbor to discuss internal matters, without
being asked first? There needs to be a debate over this question. If someone
invited Sharan, then who is it? That has to be explained. If not then our
leaders should say that they can work on the matters themselves and Sharan's
help is not needed.”

Royalists are also making hay of the situation and demanding that Monarchy
should be reinstated to combat against Indian meddling and influence. _Anil
Bhakta Kharel_ at _[Hamro Blog](http://www.hamroblog.com/?p=3773) _says that
it is time to reinstate the monarchy which at least tried to resist foreign
influence:

> “नेपालको सन्दर्भमा २४० वर्षदेखि शाहवंशले नेपालरुपी घर विग्रन–भत्कन दिएको
> थिएन। जस्तोसुकै अप्ठ्यारा परिस्थितिमा पनि आफ्नो स्वाभिमान बचाईराखेको थियो।
> राष्ट्रद्रोहीले भारतमा गएर नाकाबन्दी लगाउन लगाए पनि नेपाली जनतालाई जहाजमा
> तेल र खाद्यान्न पदार्थ ओसारेर खुवाएकै थिए। जनतासामु झुक्ने तर विदेशीको पाउ
> कहिल्यै नमोल्ने राजसंस्था जनतासामु झुक्यो। तर नेपाली जनताले त्यस्तो
> राजसंस्थालाई अझै चिन्न सकेका छैनन।”

“In Nepal's context, for 240 years the Shah dynasty did not allow Nepal to
disintegrate. Even in difficult situations, the dynasty preserved national
dignity. Even when anti-national elements made India close the borders, they
brought food and oil for the people through the ships. The dynasty that never
bowed down to foreign influence bowed down to the people. But the Nepalese
people still have not recognized the true value of the institution.”

As the Maoist and royalists are using the current political crisis to further
their agenda and gain mileage, Nepal's economy and law and order situation
continues to slide down. Nepal's biggest holiday Dashin is just round the
corner. Hopefully, the people will have something to celebrate by then.
