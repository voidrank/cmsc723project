Helping Egypt overcome the cash crunch that ensued in the wake of the January
25 Revolution, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on Sunday to a 3
billion dollar loan package to the Arab World’s most populous country.

The deal will, supposedly, help Egypt obtain funding to meet the balance of
payments deficit that now stands between $10bn and $12bn in the wake of the
revolution that overthrew president Hosni Mubarak in February.

But while the Egyptian government and Finance Minister Samir Radwan hailed the
deal as a step to “relaunch the Egyptian economy,” Egyptians were largely
skeptical, with the deal receiving negative feedback from online citizens and
activists.

On Facebook, a group entitled [“No IMF Deal for
Egypt”](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_134849016590889&ap=1) was
created and now comprises around 300 members, to discuss the deal and provide
other alternatives to save cash and reduce budget deficit.

[User Noha El Shoky](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=577820261), for
example, argues that:

> reducing the salaries of ministerial consultants could save more than 70 bln
> [billion] dollars

Another user, [Reda Eissa](http://www.facebook.com/redaaaissa) asserts that:

> it’s possible to save 36 bln dollars immediately if the private funds were
> added to the general budget balance

On Twitter, blogger and activist Gigi Ibrahim
([@Gsquare86](http://twitter.com/#!/Gsquare86)) voiced a strong refusal to the
deal:

User Amr El Gohary ([@amr_gohary](http://twitter.com/#!/amr_gohary)) is
questioning the validity of approving the deal by “a transitional government”

The deal comes after IMF praised Egypt’s draft of the 2011/2012 budget balance
which raised government spending by a quarter. The country's interim
government claims the budget will help improve social justice and remedy some
of the economic grievances that was, [according to a Gallup poll released on
Sunday](http://www.gallup.com/poll/147938/Egyptians-Optimistic-Post-
Revolution.aspx), one of the main reasons that helped trigger the anti-regime
uprising in January.

The balance centers around raising the national minimum wage from the old
level of 34 Egyptian pounds (GBP 3.50) per month to 700 Egyptian pounds, and
the establishment of a 2 billion Egyptian pound fund to pay for unemployment
benefits. The IMF said the deal will help put the Egyptian Economy on the
“right track”, despite opposition from businessmen who see the draft as
running against the neo-liberal policies that helped their businesses flourish
under Mubarak’s rule.

One thing for certain is that both Egyptians and their government are keeping
their eye on how the economic wheel is moving these days. But while Egypt’s
rulers attempt to “resurrect” this ailing sector, there is a fear lurking in
the air that this might come at the expense of post-revolution Egyptian
independence.
