that ran in the Serbian Alo! daily on Sept. 21, 2010

The tragic death of American fighter pilot [Lt. Col. Harold F. “Hootch”
Meyers](http://haroldfmeyers.weebly.com/), who [committed a
suicide](http://www.santamariatimes.com/news/local/military/article_cdf70edc-c472-11df-
bc68-001cc4c03286.html) at his home in Santa Barbara on Sept. 12, echoed in
the Serbian media and online communities – and there were strong reasons for
it.

According to the Serbian daily
[_Alo!_](http://www.alo.rs/vesti/31158/Ubio_se_ubica_Srba), Meyers was one of
the American pilots who participated in [the NATO bombing of Serbia and
Montenegro in
1999](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia). The
bloody statistics published in the article show that the air strikes caused
the deaths of 3,500 civilians, of which 79 were children, and this implies
Meyers’ direct responsibility. Before the NATO attack on Yugoslavia, he
participated in operations in the Republic of Srpska, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Serbian newspaper [_Kurir_](http://www.kurir-info.rs/vesti/ubio-se-americki-
pilot-koji-je-bombardovao-srbiju-51075.php) portrayed Meyers as a mentally
unstable person who could not withstand the pressure of conscience and the
constant nightmares that plagued him since after the 1999 bombing of
Yugoslavia. He retired a few months ago after being diagnosed with [post-
traumatic stress
disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder#Military_experience)
and severe depression.

_Kurir_ quoted Meyers’ friends stating that the pilot had nightmares for a
long time:

> “He dreamed about bombing people, their cries, screams. He dreamed of
> children, the elderly, dismembered bodies.The worst thing was when he could
> not wake up from his nightmares. It obviously came to his head,” said one of
> his friends.

Meyers’ wife Elisabeth is quoted saying that there were no reasons to suspect
that her husband would commit a suicide:

> We spent a wonderful day together, we were having lunch and enjoyed it. But
> he was unusually silent. This was a constant occurrence in the last few
> years… And when we came home, he pulled a gun and said: ”I'm sorry, I cannot
> take it anymore,” and then he fired a shot to his temple” […].

Serbian netizens’ traumatic memories and unhealed wounds from the times of the
NATO bombing initiated a heated online debate about the American pilot’s
suicide, splitting the online community into two camps: some were gloating
over Meyer's death, claiming he deserved such an end, while others followed
the Christian doctrine of forgiveness.

On the
[Vidovdan.org](http://forum.vidovdan.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=10770&p=178958)
forum, there are posts by people who lost close family members in the NATO air
strikes.

Zoran Milenkovic, whose 15-year-old daughter Sanja was killed in the NATO
bombing of Varvarin Bridge, does not regret Meyers’ death, saying that his
suicide, as well as the fate of other NATO soldiers who took part in the
bombing of Serbia, is God’s justice:

> The conscience starts to work in them. My daughter was a completely innocent
> victim. I am a victim together with her. She was a mathematical genius. She
> had a great future. That wound will never heal in me.

_Milsu_ replied to Mr. Milenkovic's statement:

> […] Little Sanja is turning around in heaven, listening to what her father
> is saying…

_Savle_ warns _Milsu_ :

> […] There is no greater suffering than the pain for a missing child. No one
> but this man knows what he has survived. You say well, it is not according
> to Christianity, but he is human and he should not be judged… In this case,
> all of them are the victims of America: Sanja, her father and the pilot… For
> Sanja, all of it ended immediately, while the pilot’s agony lasted ten
> years, and her father stays to live with the pain.

_Vladimir Veliki_ from Sremska Mitrovica still remembers the day when his wife
Ljiljana was killed by shrapnel in the backyard of his house during the
bombing of the military barracks nearby:

> My daughter and I saw Ljiljana being killed, when that pilot, as a god,
> sowed her death… We are still suffering. After 11 years… I understand that
> the pilot carried out his order, but I do not feel regrets for him when he
> killed himself!… It could be called divine or cosmic justice.

_Milsu_ concluded :

> Poor man, he repented and killed himself as Judas. It is a pity he did not
> have anyone to direct him to repent and find a cure in Christ, the way Peter
> did.

_Broker_ wrote on [Paluba.info](http://www.paluba.info/smf/ostale-vesti/ubio-
se-americki-pilot-koji-je-bombardovao-srbiju/):

> It was necessary for him to come to Serbia and he could have been forgiven.

Nationalists from the Serbian
[Stormfront.org](http://www.stormfront.org/forum/t743169/) forum reacted
vindictively, expressing no mercy for the U.S pilot. One of them concluded
very bluntly that Meyers “got what he deserved, though he had only been a
tool. The devil got what belonged to him!”

The article published in _Kurir_ caused sharp reactions from readers.

_Dimitrije_ , whose son was born three days after the start of the NATO
bombings, commented:

> For me, it is completely irrelevant whether he was killed or committed a
> suicide. It is essential that one of the executioners of Serbs got the
> punishment he deserved.

_Mrgud_ replied:

> It happens usually. Justice is slow, but…

_Bami_ asked:

> When will Blair and Clinton follow him?

_Ratko_ agreed:

> Only this one? Let’s go – Blair, Clinton, others… What are you waiting for?

_Sandra_ addressed other Serbian netizens angrily:

> You live in the past and because of that there is no future for this
> country! Stop using that ridiculous religious ‘curse’.
