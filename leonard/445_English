Although the internet and mobile phone shutdown during the protests of the
past few days have made it harder for people in Egypt to show the rest of the
world what is happening at ground level during the protests, some citizen
videos have made it through.

content/uploads/2011/01/rout-100x100.jpg)](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2011/01/rout.jpg)Both these videos show how the riot police
back away from the protesters who clearly outnumber them. When added to the
unexpected[ behavior from the
army](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/28/egypt-is-the-army-on-the-
peoples-side/): who has taken the streets when ordered by the government, who
didn't seem to enforce the declared curfew and were cheered by the protesters,
it seems to imply that the armed forces are not against the people in this
struggle.

First, a [view of the Kasr Al Nil bridge in
Cairo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VorMWFePpY), as riot police and
protesters meet head on in the middle of the bridge, and tear gas canisters
are fired as the armed forces retreat:

And in this[ next video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEbCR7x4dEA) the same
is seen in downtown Cairo at street level, as we get a first person
perspective of the moment protesters and riot police clash and it turns into a
rout.
