experimental HIV vaccine has been shown to protect against the deadly virus,
creating media buzz and giving the public health and HIV/AIDS communities
hope.

The results of the largest-ever HIV vaccine trial, which was conducted in
Thailand, were
[announced](http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2009/ThaiVaxStudy.htm)
last week in a press release. Known as RV144, the study tested a combination
of two older HIV vaccines on more than 16,000 Thai volunteers. The regimen was
not only found to be safe, it was also 31 percent effective in preventing HIV
infections. The trial was
[performed](http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/FeatureStories/archive/2009/20090923_vaccine.asp)
by the Thai Ministry of Public Health and sponsored by the U.S. Army Surgeon
General.

Almost [5,500 people](
http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/News/aidsfaq.html) die due to
AIDS every day and an estimated 32 million people have died from the disease
since it surfaced in the early 1980s. The trial's results have been called
[modestly
effective](http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2009/ThaiVaxStudy.htm)
and a small step towards finding a safe and highly effective vaccine to help
fight the disease. A post on the _Asia Health Care Blog_ [elaborates](
http://www.asiahealthcareblog.com/2009/09/25/understanding-the-hivaids-
vaccine/) on this cautious optimism.

> “Many public health experts, even ones with close links to the project, have
> been cautious about getting too excited about these results, particularly
> experts in countries where HIV/AIDS has become a pandemic, like in India.
> Some have called it a base hit as opposed to a home run, and everyone is
> saying that just because this trial may have had some success, a ‘cure’ is
> still many years away. In fact, experts do not even know how the vaccine
> mechanism works.”

Still, organizations such as UNAIDS are hailing the findings, saying it has
instilled [new
hope](http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/FeatureStories/archive/2009/20090923_vaccine.asp)
in the 20-plus year search for a vaccine, which so far has seen few successes.
Many bloggers, such as Brandon Lacy Campos, were also optimistic, despite
recognizing the study's limitations. Blogging on _My Feet Only Walk Forward_ ,
he [says](http://myfeetonlywalkforward.blogspot.com/2009/09/first-efficacious-
hiv-vaccine-found.html):

> “Let the joyous news be spread the Red Ribbon Witch May One Day Be Dead!
>
> Even though the study found that the vaccine only reduces the risk by 31%
> (which is way fucking better than 0%).  
>  Even though the study was only done in Thailand with the strain of HIV most
> prevalent in Asia.  
>  Even though the U.S. Army was the main funder of the vaccine trial.
>
> I am still tickled red by this news.

> Never before has any HIV vaccine been proven to be effective in preventing

> not begrudge me my joy. I understand the limitations and boundaries of that

> we let it.”

Beachlover, commenting on a post on _Sawatdee Gay Thailand_ , is also not
giving up hope that a vaccine may be found. He [says]( http://www.sawatdee-
gay-thailand.com/forum/gay-thailand/thailand-aids-vaccine-
results-t18423.html):

> “A vaccine is likely a long way off. But it may happen eventually… they've
> only been going for 20 years and there's plenty of vaccines, which have
> taken decades to research.”

Other bloggers remain less optimistic, pointing out the study's potential
flaws and questioning whether the results are actually statistically
significant. The vaccine was
[tested](http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2009/ThaiVaxStudy.htm) on
HIV-negative adult men and women, half of who received the vaccine while the
rest were given inactive placebo shots. Over the course of three years, 74 of
8,198 people who received placebo shots became infected with HIV compared with
51 of the 8,197 who got the vaccine. The difference was found to be
statistically significant, but PinoyPoz, blogging on _Back In The Closet_ from
the Philippines, expresses skepticism over the results. He
[says](http://backinthecloset.blogspot.com/2009/09/examine-vaccine.html):

> “I apologize, but really, I was skeptical to begin with. I’d never read
> about any even minute developments towards a vaccine against HIV. It was
> just too out of the blue and too sudden to be a success, I thought. I know,
> my pessimism got ahead of me. I just needed to read all about it myself….
>
> … With the “vaccine”, approximately 6 in every 1,000 people got infected.
> But even without the “vaccine”, the chances of getting infected were still
> small. Just 9 in every 1,000 people. The difference? For me, minute.”

Martin, blogging in the U.K. on _The Lay Scientist_ , also expresses much
skepticism. He [says](http://www.layscience.net/node/640):

> “We have a result that is barely statistically significant, using a vaccine
> comprised of two components previously shown not to work, a methodology
> heavily criticised by a galaxy of experts in a joint letter to Science, and
> quirks in the results which would be consistent with the vaccine not
> working.
>
> I'm not going to stick my neck out and call this trial a failure, but no
> self-respecting skeptic can look at this results and declare them to be
> anything other than tenuous.”

Some bloggers speculate that regardless of whether or not the trial results
are a reason to celebrate, people may use it as an excuse to stop practicing
safer sex. Jimbo, blogging from Malaysia on _In My Father's Footsteps_ ,
[says](http://jimbocyberdoc.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/sex-starved-rabbits/):

> “We cannot deny the possibility of a ‘rebound’ effect, in which people are
> lured into a false sense of security and let down their guard, like in the
> early days of HIV/AIDS where gay men returned to unsafe sex when AZT, the
> first anti-HIV medicine produced and marketed, was made available. They
> thought a cure for HIV has been found! In fact, Jimbo would think that it
> would be foolhardy to think that such a rebound effect would not occur.”

Other [bloggers](http://nohandsjones.blogspot.com/2009/09/breakthrough-hiv-
vaccine.html) hope that more questions about the trial and the vaccine's true
potential will be answered when the research paper is presented at the [AIDS
Vaccine Conference
2009](http://www.hivvaccineenterprise.org/conference/2009/index.aspx). The
conference will take place from October 19 to 22 in Paris, France.
