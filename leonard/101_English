On Friday, June 17 the [United Nations Human Rights Council passed a
resolution](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38762&Cr=prejudice&Cr1)
expressing “grave concern at the violence and discrimination experienced by
people because of their sexual orientation…” As part of the resolution, the
Council called for a global study of discrimination against LGBT communities
around the world.

The resolution passed narrowly: twenty-three members voted in favor of the
resolution, while nineteen voted against it, and three abstained. Among the
nations that supported the measure was Cuba. In the days following the
resolution, Cuban bloggers and Twitter users celebrated this significant
victory for the island’s LGBT communities.

[Diversidad CENESEX](http://diversidadcenesex.blogcip.cu/2011/06/17/cuba-
apoya-resolucion-en-naciones-unidas-sobre-diversidad-sexual/) [es], the
official blog of the Centro Nacional de Educación Sexual (National Center for
Sexual Education, CENESEX), wrote:

> El voto favorable de Cuba es muestra de la voluntad política de nuestro
> Partido y Estado en eliminar todas las formas de discriminación que
> lamentablemente aún persisten en la sociedad cubana.

Cuba’s affirmative vote shows the political will of our Party and State to
eliminate all forms of discrimination that unfortunately still persist in
Cuban society.

While state-supported LGBT rights advocates like CENESEX and Hombres para la
Diversidad (HxD) offered vociferous support for the measure for several
months, independent (non-state) groups have participated in the effort as
well: _[La isla y la
espina](http://laislaylaespina.blogspot.com/2011/05/santiago-de-cuba-jornada-
cubana-contra.html)_ [es] reported on a gay rights parade held in May, in the
eastern city of Santiago, which was organized to support the vote. The blog's
author wrote:

This is not a movie. These are the streets of my city. The Cuban mission
against homophobia.

_[es], one of the most vocal LGBT advocates in Cuba’s blogging community,
wrote of the great achievement that the measure represented. Yet he also noted
that in spite of popular support for the measure, state press organizations
only covered the vote online–print publications did not cover the event at
all.

…national print newspapers…did not receive a single dispatch from the press
agency that would have told them what had happened.

[…]

Why did we lose this opportunity to educate the population about the position
of the Party, the State, and the Cuban government regarding these issues? […]
What kept the print news organizations from obtaining the information that was
published on Cuban digital news sites?

While the vote proves the Cuban government's desire to support progressive
policy on an international scale, it appears that on the island, society and
the state may have much work to do before these issues are fully recognized by
the public.
