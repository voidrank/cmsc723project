2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/)._**

When disaster struck on March 11th, Japan was thrust onto the global stage. As
inquiries, goodwill, advice, and donations pour in from around the world,
citizens have responded in kind through various forms of [social
translation](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/05/13/ted-embraces-
social-translation/).

**Earthquake manual**

This is a [basic manual](http://nip0.wordpress.com/) on how to protect
yourself during an earthquake, translated into 24 languages by students from
the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies.

> This project started from just one TUFS university student from statement on
> Twitter. Since the magic of twitter, a large number of people turned into
> strong supporters who built up number of teams to make all the translation,
> more than 24 languages. Thanks to everyone who support this project.

They even have a Japanese [easy
version](http://nip0.wordpress.com/about/japaneseeasy-ver/) with
[katakana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana).

**English wiki about earthquake information**

This straightforward [wiki](http://www46.atwiki.jp/earthquakeinfo_en/)
contains practical information about the earthquake in English.

**Japanese translations for #prayforjapan**

Tweets with #prayerforjapan have been a source of great comfort to the people
in Japan, and Noda Yuuki kicked off a crowdsourced project to translate the
flood of tweets into Japanese. He is using
[tweetvite](http://tweetvite.com/event/yk3), his [personal
blog](http://yuukey55.blog115.fc2.com/blog-entry-106.html), and of course
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/yuu_key) to call for people to pitch in.
Translated tweets are bundled here on
[Togetter](http://togetter.com/li/110982).

**Spreading happy energy**

Gen Taguchi, of [100shiki](http://www.100shiki.com/) blog fame, tweeted
[this](http://twitter.com/#!/taguchi/status/46421908769611776) on March 10th:

> 元気の出るつぶやきを集めました・・・ – <http://bit.ly/h52EM9>

> @taguchi
> タグチさん、ありがとうございます。これ、英訳しても良いですか？「日本人すごいね」みたいなのは、あまり強調しすぎるとイヤミになりますが、ならないように気をつけて。海外の友達にも知らせたいです。私は同時通訳者・翻訳者です。すでに翻訳中なら一緒に！

@taguchi Mr. Taguchi, thank you! Can I translate these into English? I'll be
careful to stay away from the “Wow, the Japanese are wonderful” angle but I
want my friends abroad to know about these conversations. I am a professional
simultaneous translator and interpreter. If you've already started, let me
join!

Here are a few selected tweets, with translations by @vida_es_bella.

> バスが全然来ない中、@saiso が、バス停の前にある薬局でカイロを買ってきて、並んで待ってる人みんなに配った！

While waiting for a bus almost eternally, @saiso went into a drugstore in
front of the bus stop, bought a bunch of hand warmers and handed them to those
waiting for a bus!

> 日本人すごい！！こんな時にも山手線ホームできれいに整列してる …涙。有楽町駅を上から眺む。

Look! People are forming lines so orderly, waiting for a train on the Yamanote
Line, the ring train circling the center of Tokyo. Proud to be Japanese.
Looking down at Yuraku-cho Station (near Tokyo Station).

Fukushima Prefecture:

> スーパーで無事買物出来ましたヽ(´o｀； でもお客さんのほとんどが他の人の事を考えて必要最低限しか買わない感じだったのが感動しました（涙）

I was able to do necessary grocery shopping after the quake. I was moved when
I saw most people showed consideration for others by NOT buying more than what
they absolutely need for the time being. Their act of conscience brought tears
to my eyes.

**Blogs**

Many bloggers have also put their language skills to good use, highlighting
useful resources and positive messages in their own languages.

Hatena blogger herbe published an [English
list](http://h.hatena.com/herbe/243597512623822452) of the frequency channels
for NHK Radio 2(AM), which offers English, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese and
Spanish broadcasting.

Jiro Ohmizu translated 50+ [tweets](http://jiro.bmr.jp/post/3786925211/50)
from celebrities abroad into Japanese on his site.

[](http://gakuranman.com/great-tohoku-earthquake/)

Roy Berman published a post entitled [Who can and can not donate blood in
Japan](http://www.mutantfrog.com/2011/03/13/who-can-and-can-not-donate-blood-
in-japan/) (and [more](http://www.mutantfrog.com/2011/03/13/a-note-on-energy-
conservation/)):

> There has been a lot of confusion over who exactly is allowed to donate

> Cross official web page.

Non-fiction writer Minetoshi Yasuda has set up [a bulletin
board](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/dongyingwenren/e/321f796c1b9e4cad1bbeedd6cab22877)
for Chinese language speakers:

> 中国国内のミニブログで流れている  
>  日本に留学や仕事で行っている中国人の安否を尋ねる情報を、  
>  ツイッターで、留学生の樹八さん（@hathiko8）という方が集積している。  
>  以下、中国から見られるうちのブログに転載しておく。  
>  元ツイート等で携帯番号の記載があるものは、  
>  場合が場合なのでそのまま載せます。  
>  台湾とか香港の人探し情報も受け付け。

Twitter user @hathiko8 is diving into Chinese miniblogs to gather requests and
information about Chinese students and workers in Japan. Below is a copy of
her tweets, since my blog is accessible from China. I will try to include as
many phone numbers as I can. We're also accepting questions from Taiwan and
Hong Kong.

**Images**

And of course, words need not be spoken (or translated!) with images.
Webstagram has a filtered view for [Instagram
photos](http://web.stagram.com/tag/prayforjapan/) with #prayforjapan. There is
a Naver [page](http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2129988433846418301) that has
bundled images, too.
