The People's Action Party (PAP)
[dominated](http://www.elections.gov.sg/elections_results2011.html) the recent
[General Elections](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/01/singapore-
social-media-youth-and-elections/) in Singapore but opposition parties also
scored some important victories as well. PAP has been in power since 1959.

[_Ng E-Jay_](http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=6789) interprets the results:

> The results of the 2011 general election show that Singaporeans have grown
> more discontent with the ruling party, and that they are more prepared to
> vent their frustrations at the ballot box. However at the last moment, some
> voters appear to have held their cool, and retained support for the PAP.

Despite [retaining](http://www.motochan.com/2011/05/08/singapore-
elections-2011-results/) majority seats in the parliament, the PAP’s reduced
numbers in the polls were the lowest in several decades. _Siew Kum Hong_
[explains](http://siewkumhong.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-next-for-pap.html) the
decline of PAP:

> …the PAP lost because it had lost touch with the ground. It had clearly
> under-estimated the extent of antipathy towards it by a large margin.
>
> The themes of government accountability and arrogance played so strongly
> with the electorate, that the Prime Minister was compelled to apologise for
> the errors of his Government late in the campaign.

_yawning bread_ credits the [new
media](http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/groundwork-good-
candidates-and-consistent-branding/) for the improved performance of the
opposition Singapore Democratic Party:

> I think the key move was actually its sustained investment in new media,
> allowing it to reach a new audience directly. Couple that with a party stand
> that combines substance with principled clarity, and it attracts a second
> look from citizens.

_Words of the Cze_
[identifies](http://piaroh.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/general-election-2011/)
the Workers Party, which won a strategic Group Representation Constituency, as
the leader of the opposition:

> The Workers Party (WP) is now the opposition leader by a long shot, ensuring
> that its model of ‘constructive opposition’ and alternative policy
> suggestions will be dominant in the political paradigm for the foreseeable
> future. My perspective, for those unfamiliar, is very simple: the political
> space for the opposition is going to grow no matter what the PAP does, and
> it might as well be filled by the WP rather than just about any other party.

_Politics_
[thinks](http://politicshap.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/ge-2011-preliminary-
analysis/) that PAP has “lost the ability to dictate the agenda”:

> PAP has lost the ability to dictate the agenda. The PAP has originally
> campaigned on leadership renewal, 4G leadership etc, but it was obvious
> during the campaigning period, other issues such as cost of living, liberal
> immigrant policy, and housing took the stage

_harishpillay_ believes that the [voting
results](http://satayclub.net/2011/05/election-results-big-swing-against-pap/)
will [inspire](http://harishpillay.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/its-
may-8th-2011-and-it-is-a-brand-new-singapore/) Singaporeans living in other
countries:

> We have to build on the momentum of these elections. I am sure that these
> results will perhaps spur many a Singaporean who gave up on their country
> and moved overseas to consider returning. To return and help build this into
> a nation that we can all be extremely proud of

_Scrutinizing the Singapore government_ gives
[advice](http://sgpublicpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/aftermath-of-ge2011/)
to political parties which intend to participate in the 2016 elections.
_Keanbon_ argues that PAP now has a “[weak
mandate](http://musthavebeengood.blogspot.com/2011/05/in-all-6014.html)“:

> The spell is broken. Ruling with such a weak mandate necessitates a very
> serious endeavour in finding out and tackling the root causes – what members
> of the electorate are finally saying via the ballot box. Only then can new
> proposals be introduced and discussed on without a baggage. I hope this
> happens productively in the next 5 years.

_Redbean_ [reminds](http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2011/05/daft-
singaporeans-voted.html) the opposition to field better candidates if they
want to dominate the next elections:

> For once, the PAP was humbled by the shift in sentiments against them. They
> sensed it during the election hustings. They knew that the people were
> angry. And they started to tone down their cocky and high and mighty
> approach even before Polling Day.
>
> What is important is that the people have shown that they were most willing
> to change if there are good alternatives. If the opposition can attract more
> good candidates, the next GE is going to see a better contest.

According to _Singapore Sojourn_ , the results showed that the people are
[“not happy with the status
quo”](http://singaporesojourn.blogspot.com/2011/05/bigger-red-dot.html):

> So behind the numbers what does this all mean? The return of a stable
> government in a volatile economic environment is a real plus and the PAP's
> stewardship through the toughest of recessionary times should not be
> forgotten.
>
> Despite this acceptance, the people of Singapore have signalled strongly to
> the government that they are not happy with the status quo; especially the
> growing wealth gap, the influx of foreign workers, rising prices and the
> cost of housing.

The results [didn’t
impress](http://politicalwritings.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/a-fair-result-but-
not-necessarily-a-good-result/) _Political Writings:_

> The result is a very clear message from the electorate for the “opposition”:
> field good candidates, as good or better than the PAP candidates, and we’ll
> vote you. Conversely, field no-hopers and axe-grinders, we’ll dump you!
>
> PAP got a very clear message from the electorate too: don’t threaten us,
> don’t talk down to us, don’t belittle us, don’t call us to repent.
>
> Still, PAP has 81 seats against 6 for WP. And that’s hardly a good result!

_funny little world_ has a [message for
PAP](http://kirstenhan.me/2011/05/08/a-message-to-all-who-voted-pap/):

> I hope the PAP will not forget that they represent all Singaporeans, not
> just the ones who voted for them. I hope you will not forget that too.
>
> I hope the PAP will not forget that we are humans, not economic digits. I
> hope you will not forget that too.
