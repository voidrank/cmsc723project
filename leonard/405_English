As protests in [Egypt](../specialcoverage/egypt-protests-2011/) continue,
Latin American bloggers are drawing historical parallels with similar
uprisings in the region and some are wondering: “Could it happen here now?”

In _The Mex Files_ , Rich compares Egypt's situation to [Porfirio
Diaz’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porfirio_D%C3%ADaz) 30-year rule in Mexico
–which fell during the [Mexican
Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Revolution)– in his post,
[“Walk like an Egyptian: Porfirio to
Mubarak.”](http://mexfiles.net/2011/01/30/walklike-an-egyptian/) Rich
concludes his analysis looking at Mexico today:

> Mexicans are not — one trusts — as desperate as the Egyptians, or at least
> not in the numbers seen in Cairo. But, what will happen if the Mexicans
> decide it is time for a giant leap in Mexican power, in which the people of
> the largest Spanish-speaking nation demand that they be allowed to fulfill
> their potential?

Greg Weeks writes about the similarities and differences between Nicaragua and
Egypt from a historical perspective in his blog [_Two Weeks
Notice_](http://weeksnotice.blogspot.com/2011/01/nicaragua-and-egypt.html):

> It is impossible not to make analogies between the current situation in
> Egypt and the implosion of dictatorships in Latin America. Anastasio Somoza
> in particular comes to mind. Broadly speaking, the U.S. had supported a
> dictatorship for decades because it was a strategic ally, then internal
> opposition began to boil, hoping to copy the toppling of another repressive
> regime in the region.

> There are, however, also very important differences.

_Global Voices_ author [Rodrigo Peñalba](../author/rodrigo-penalba/) was
recently interviewed by Nicaraguan newspaper [_El Nuevo
Diario_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Nuevo_Diario). Rodrigo posted his
answers to the newspaper's questions in [his

**In Nicaragua, is the phenomenon seen in Tunisia and Egypt far from the
national reality?**

Tunisia and Egypt are responding to specific contexts of authoritarian
governments with leaders in power for decades that have the open support of
the United States. If there was a domino effect between both countries, this
would happen first in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia rather than
Central America.

If the question is whether something like this could happen in Nicaragua, we
would have to look at closer contexts such as Mexican drug violence, groups of
maras [gangs] in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, immigration in the
region, the coup in Honduras, or the power drama in Panama, Costa Rica,
Venezuela or Colombia; or in the case of Nicaragua at the 3-way marriage
between businessmen (advertisers in mass media), political parties (which get
interviewed by the media) and the government (which friends of the media
aspire to manage).

In the post [“Could instability spread to Latin
America?”](http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/2011/02/could-instability-spread-to-
latin.html) in _Bloggings by boz_ , Boz focuses on the “global” –or “Tsunami”–
theory: “An outside force created the conditions for these protests to hit
many nations at the same time.” Boz explains:

> it's the global factors I want to focus on, because if it is true, then the
> current crisis is not just affecting the Middle East. Latin America, sub-
> Saharan Africa and Asia could be next.

He goes through six points to answer the question: “If [2011] is a crisis
year, what would it mean for Latin America?” and then writes,

> If this is a “crisis year,” then governments are going to be destabilized in
> ways that you thought six months ago would be near impossible.
>
> That said, most governments will survive. Even facing tough protests,
> governments tend to hold on to power more often than they fall. Not every
> protests or momentary difficulty will lead to a government falling. Also, in
> a region where democracy is the expectation rather than the exception,
> governments that do fall should return to democracy more quickly than in
> some other regions of the world.

Mike from [_Central American
Politics_](http://centralamericanpolitics.blogspot.com/) responds in [the open
thread](http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/2011/02/open-thread-
stability.html?showComment=1296596366153#c6957069042679673443) at _Bloggings
by boz_ on the subject. He breaks down his opinion by country:

> Where to start? Interestingly enough, I think that if we survey the region,
> non-friendly governments of the US are the most likely to fall.

> Ecuador – close to falling last year; recent history of extra constitutional
> removals
>
> Bolivia – protests against gas prices recently; recent history of extra
> constitutional removals
>
> Venezuela and Cuba are candidates, but will probably not see much
> instability. Honduras is a candidate as well, but there would have to be
> some spark to reignite things.

Asking “Could it happen here?” has been inevitable among bloggers who intently
follow politics and social movements in the region. No one can know for
certain if any Latin American country will get caught under the “political
tsunami;” but what these bloggers do know is that in the history of Latin
America, uprisings against the government are not unusual.
