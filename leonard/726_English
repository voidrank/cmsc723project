Today the Portuguese writer and only Portuguese language Nobel Prize Winner in
Literature José Saramago died at age 87 in his residence in Lanzarote victim
of old age and prolonged illness leaving us with a rich body of fiction filled
with philosophic reflection through which he created situations improbable and
impossible as they were critical including the bestsellers
[Blindness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_\(novel\)) that describes a
country where everybody loses their sight and [Death with
Interruptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_with_Interruptions) that
explores social conflicts in a country where people stop dying.

Note from the author: The absence of punctuation in this post is intentional.

[@LuisMonteiro](http://twitter.com/LuisMonteiro/status/16466629541) José
Saramago struck me with his integrity, non-attachment to fame, loyal posture
in relation to his ideals, as much as sometimes we might not share them. Man.

His atheist and militantly communist convictions set apart a revolutionary
soul one not always accepted or understood: he moved to Spain in the 1990s
after having been barred from participating in literary competitions with the
polemic work “[The Gospel according to Jesus
Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_According_to_Jesus_Christ)“.

[@tuliovianna](http://twitter.com/tuliovianna/status/16467084353) If Christian
hell exists, at this moment Saramago is being received with state honors;
Darwin is giving a welcome speech

Only a few minutes after the announcement of Saramago's death netcitizens
around the world began paying tribute to Saramago who became one of the most
commented topics on Twitter even in spite of the irony that this represents as
his opposition to this communication tool was quite well known.

[@marionel](http://twitter.com/marionel/status/16467403159) Saramago did not
like Twitter nor did he believe very much in the Internet, even so he is
receiving a tribute as Trending Topic 5 <http://tweetphoto.com/27811330>

Saramago's writing style was challenging in translation and particularly in
the original Portuguese as some noted

[@diegomaia](http://twitter.com/diegomaia/status/16466784884) How about if
everybody wrote without punctuation today in hommage to Saramago #saramagoday

[@maria_fro](http://twitter.com/maria_fro/status/1646591570) I'm really sad,
#Saramago more than just being an excellent writer was admirable in his
coherence and his principles http://migre.me/Q28O #mourning

Maria Frô also gives some reading suggestions on Saramago on her
[blog](http://mariafro.com.br/wordpress/?p=2767") particularly the last
interviews that he did with El País where the writer said [Don't talk to me
about death, because I already know
it](http://www.elpais.com/articulo/portada/hablen/muerte/conozco/elpepusoceps/20081123elpepspor_3/Tes).

The last text published on Saramago's blog called “[Think,
Think](http://caderno.josesaramago.org/2010/06/18/pensar-pensar)” leaves us to
ponder the intellectual and ideological value of a personality that will live
on through words.

> Acho que na sociedade actual nos falta filosofia. Filosofia como espaço,
> lugar, método de refexão, que pode não ter um objectivo determinado, como a
> ciência, que avança para satisfazer objectivos. Falta-nos reflexão, pensar,
> precisamos do trabalho de pensar, e parece-me que, sem ideias, nao vamos a
> parte nenhuma.

I think that in today's society we are lacking philosophy. Philosophy as a
space, place, a method of reflection, that may not have a specific objective,
like science, that advances to satisfy objectives. What we are lacking is
reflection, thinking, we need the work that is thinking, and it seems to me
that without ideas, we are going nowhere.
