Two Mumbai based corporate executives _[Satish
Vijaykumar](http://www.bombaylives.com/)_ and _[Ranjeet
Walunj](http://mayavi.info/)_ started a successful online and offline campaign
that is aimed to change the face of Mumbai, India by making it more green.

_Pushpee_ at _Welcome To Mumbai_ [tells](http://mumbai-
pushpa.blogspot.com/2009/12/sapling-project-in-mumbai.html) why this kind of
project is required:

> There is too much dust, pollution, population in Mumbai and there are new
> constructions cropping up everyday and the sad part is that the trees are
> chopped down for this concrete progression. But do you realize that soon
> there will be only concrete jungle with no greenery left and the only place
> where we will find greenery is when we to go to a park for our regular
> walk???

The blogger adds:

> In Mumbai, we only see two kinds of birds: crows and pigeons, where are
> those other beautiful birds?

_Satish Vijaykumar_ [announced](http://www.bombaylives.com/index.php/the-
sapling-project.html) this in his blog _Bombay Lives_ on November 24, 2009:

> [Me](http://twitter.com/bombaylives) and
> [Ranjeet](http://twitter.com/ranjeet_walunj) are doing a small campaign to
> plant and share saplings, free of cost to one and all in different parts of
> our city.
>
> Do check out <http://thesaplingproject.com/> for more details and to sign up
> for the saplings.

The project website [informs](http://www.thesaplingproject.com/synopsis.php)
that plants will be distributed freely. Additionally people can sponsor Neem
or Ashoka plants @ 40 Indian Rupees (about 85 cents) per sapling. To
participate one has to plant a couple of saplings, nurture them for at least
two years and report about their growth.

And here comes the online twist. _The Times of India_
[reports](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Citizens-log-on-for-
a-green-campaign/articleshow/5360101.cms) that the project prefers that the
plant owners will have an online profile and using citizen and social media
tools like Twitter, blog, Flickr & YouTube, they will report the updates,
photos and videos of the growth of the plants.

The campaign was heavily publicized using blogs ([Bombay
Lives](http://www.bombaylives.com/index.php/distribution-drive-the-sapling-
project.html), [Mayavi World](http://mayavi.info/index.php/environment/the-
sapling-project-mumbai-december-2009.html)) and other social media tools like
