[Blog Action Day](http://blogactionday.change.org/about) is an annual event
held every October 15 that unites the world's bloggers in posting about the
same issue on the same day. This year the action theme is ‘water’. A number of
South Asian bloggers have also participated in this event. Let us look at what
some of them are discussing about.

### India:

_Ishrath_ at _Wandering Mist_ [writes](http://www.wanderingmist.com/net-
effort/water-for-blog-action-day-2010/):

> [Water in India](http://www.indiawaterportal.org/) is a paradox. It has
> always been the boon and the bane for the length and breadth of the nation.
> North India gives birth to water. South India fights for the rivers that
> flow. Northwest India is a water-starved desert. And Eastern India has the
> highest rainfall that helps none.
>
> And to top it, the water woes in India include contamination, inadequacy,
> denial, corruption, portability problems, access, deaths & diseases,
> pollution, irresponsible industrial growth dependent on water, and a whole
> lot more. [..]
>
> We have forgotten our [ingenious ways of life](http://treesouls.com/eco-
> conservation/anupam-mishras-ted-talk-on-the-ancient-ingenuity-of-water-
> harvesting/) where every natural resource such as water, was used and not
> abused. There were no endless showers, hot tubs, rain parties, or huge water
> tanks to ensure that the water kept running during all ablutions. Water was
> rationed as per use. There was no concepts of 24/7 water supply where every
> household had to dig into their bit of land. We, with knowledge, cognizance
> and responsibility, are continually turning earth into living hell.

### Nepal:

_Bhumika Ghimire_ [sheds a
light](http://americannepali.blogspot.com/2010/10/nepals-water-woes.html) into
the water issues in Nepal:

> Water crisis is directly related to Nepal's deteriorating environment. In
> capital Kathmandu, many areas don't get water for six days a week, and are
> forced to either buy water through dealers or have to rely on local wells
> and rivers-whose water quality is not monitored.

_Ujjwal Acharya_ [posts a picture](http://www.nepalivoices.com/nepal-
blog/2010/10/15/w-a-t-e-r/) showing how water is associated with our day to
day lives.

### Pakistan:

Although Pakistan is suffering from the worst flood in past century, some of
its region are dry and suffer from desertification. _Khalida Brohi_ , an
indigenous girl from Balochistan, Pakistan [notes](http://khalida-
brohi.blogspot.com/2010/10/i-search-for-water-voice-of-indigenous.html) that
indigenous people are the first ones to be worst hit by climate change:

> Balochistans traditional forms of livelihood and using of agricultural land
> have now slowly been changing, The two methods Khushkaba and Sailaba of
> agriculture are diverted, the usually making of bands to use up flood water
> for lands doesn’t work because floods have change course as now even the
> ingenious knowledge can’t predict from where the flesh floods would be
> attacking, once a blessing to the people of valleys in Baluchistan,
> mountains are now a danger of disaster them.

_Jalal HB_ at _Fire Within_
[writes](http://sajshirazi.blogspot.com/2010/10/drinking-water-and-thar-
women.html) about the scarcity of drinking water in the Thar deserts of Sindh
province:

> When it rains, the rain water gets collected in small low lying bowl shaped
> ponds called the “tobas” where men and animals drink together. There are no
> alternatives as well digging is not possible. Even if there is a success,
> the water is so brackish and salty that it cannot be consumed for drinking
> purposes.
