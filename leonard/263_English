_has garnered strong responses from Mexican netizens based at home and abroad.
Citing American and Mexican officials, “U.S. Drones Fight Mexican Drug Trade”
relayed news that “the Obama administration has begun sending drones deep into
Mexican territory to gather intelligence that helps locate major traffickers
and follow their networks.”

The Pentagon first dispatched the high-altitude, unmanned drones in February,
according to the _Times_ report. The Associated Press later
[reported](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110316/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_drug_war_mexico_us)
that US drones have been flying over Mexico since 2009.

Presidents Obama and Calderon formalized an agreement to continue the
reconnaissance flights during the latter's visit to Washington on March 3.
During the same meeting, the leaders also agreed to institute a second
counter-narcotics “fusion center,” where American authorities would
collaborate with counterparts on the ground in Mexico.

Bloggers were prompt to respond to this and subsequent accounts in the
mainstream media of what were bound to be contentious developments. Early off
the mark was blogger Pepe Flores, who weighed in on [_Vivir
México_](http://vivirmexico.com/2011/03/estados-unidos-envia-drones-a-mexico-
para-combatir-al-narco) [es].

The pact was kept secret due to legal restrictions in Mexico and to
sensitivity surrounding national sovereignty.

The _NYT_ underscored something that is well known in Mexico: the role of the
United States in the war against narco-trafficking is becoming ever greater.

Having glossed what amount to the bullet points in the _NYT_ ‘s report, Flores
went on to provide relevant context as well as analysis.

Still, the climate of cooperation between Mexico and the United States is not
the best. If the relationship isn't quite cold, there is still talk of much
resentment between both parties. On the one hand, Calderon finds himself very
preoccupied with public perception, since this intervention could be
considered unconstitutional. Still, if it is done like the Merida Initiative,
it could be treated as an executive agreement – a type of oral accord between
two presidents that doesn't require ratification by the two Congresses.

On the same day, Erwin in [_The Latin
Americanist_](http://ourlatinamerica.blogspot.com/2011/03/mr-calderon-goes-to-
washington-i-spy.html) published a post entitled “Mr. Calderon goes to
Washington – I spy with my little eye…” that took up the matter of the
constitutionality of the accords, and issued a cautionary reminder.

Blogger “[boz](http://www.blogger.com/profile/13233148632004720002)” was
likewise cautionary in [his
response.](http://www.blogingsbyboz.com/2011/03/us-military-drones-in-

Blogger __[“Gancho”](http://ganchoblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/more-on-
drones.html) put himself in the place of Mexican authorities trying to
persuade a reluctant public of the wisdom of inviting the U.S. drones to
Mexico.

Meanwhile, links to the _New York Times_ report and subsequent media accounts
made their way around Twitter; while most were unaccompanied by editorial
remarks, there were exceptions. Diego

tweeted:

The intrusion of Drones in #Mexico, shows ineptitude in an absurd war without
visible results. Espionage: the other enemy! A tepid response

After [recent reports](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12784675)
that US drones killed 40 civilians in Pakistan, Julio Izquierdo
(@[mustanghead](http://twitter.com/#!/mustanghead/statuses/48883018487705601))
expressed a common concern:

Hopefully the _gringo_ drones (robot planes) won't start causing innocent
victims like in Pakistan
