Although there is undoubtedly a strong push to grow information and
communication technology (ICT) initiatives for development in francophone
Africa, the region is still somewhat lagging behind their English-speaking
neighbors. The recognition of this lag is discussed by [many Francophone
bloggers](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/abidjan-blog-camps/)
and aggregated at the [Franco Techno Gap
blog](http://www.francotechnogap.com/).

The cause of the lag is unclear but a few reasons are often proposed: 1)
broadband internet was made available by [governments of English speaking
nations](http://www.afrik.com/article6034.html) such as (South Africa,
Mauritius, Egypt) first (fr). Consequently, [cost of internet
access](http://www.laconscience.com/article.php?id_article=7705) is on average
higher as further explained on [l'atelier des
medias](http://atelier.rfi.fr/profiles/blogs/1189413:BlogPost:28370) (RFI)
(fr). 2) Related to the previous reason: “[English speaking countries seem to
be doing better](http://subsaharska.com/eng/articles/main/nta1257027327/) than
the French speaking countries” as Miquel points out 3) The English language is
still the default language globally when one discusses ICT.

In this post, current grass roots development projects in francophone Africa
with an important ICT component will be discussed in further details:

**Agriculture**

The community blog of the _[Union des Femmes Rurales Ouest Africaines et du
Tchad](http://resacifroat.blogspot.com/)_ ( **UFROAT) ( Union of Rural Women
in West Africa and Chad) describes the[objectives of the
association](http://resacifroat.blogspot.com/2008/02/l-ufroat-en-
question.html) as follows (fr):**

> -Promouvoir les échanges entre femmes rurales au niveau national et sous
> régional,  
>  -Promouvoir la participation et la représentation des femmes rurales dans
> les instances de décision,  
>  – Promouvoir la commercialisation des produits des femmes rurales

-Promote the exchange between women in rural areas at the national and regional levels.  
-Promote women participation and representation in the decision making process  
-Promote the commercialization of products generated by rural women.

In the following video, _Agnegue Enyo from Togo_ explains that thanks to a
recent workshop on ICT, she learned how to create, format and submit activity
reports about her project. She says she used to have to pay someone to scan
all the paperwork, archive and send reports for her. Not anymore.  

A similar project in Madagascar, Bekoto Paysans, aims to [protect the rights
of Malagasy farmers](http://bekotopaysans.blogspot.com/), highlights their
daily activities and challenges (fr). It is spear headed by renown Malagasy
singer Bekoto, a member of the folk group _[Mahaleo](http://mahaleo.com)_.
Bekoto describes why [Malagasy bees and the honey they produce have unique
properties](http://bekotopaysans.blogspot.com/2010/04/hstoire-animale-les-
abeilles-malgaches1.html) and in danger of becoming extinct (fr):

> L'abeille Malgache possède sa propre spécificité . C'est une espèce
> endémique considérée comme ” laborieuse et pacifique “. Il fut une époque où
> Madagascar exportait son miel en Europe et des “tonnes avaient été envoyés à
> l'extérieur de 1920 à 1940 [..] Depuis les symptômes du Varroa qui
> frappèrent l'apiculture dans la région d'Analamanga en 2007 , les mêmes
> signes de maladie avaient été aussi signalés sur la côte Est : ‘ Les essaims
> s'effondrèrent …les abeilles ne volaient plus et les ruches se vidaient mais
> des abeilles sauvages résistent

Malagasy bees possess unique properties. It is an endemic species that is
described as ” hard working and peaceful”. Madagascar use to export tons of
honey to Europe from the 1920's to the 40s [..] Since then, signs that Varroa
disease have plagued the region of Analamanga in 2007, and then on the East
coast. Swarms are disappearing, bees were not seen as much anymore and hives
are empty except for wild bees.

**Education**

_Djénéba Traoré_ develops the challenges of integrating ICT with education in
sub Saharan Africa in five countries (Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Mali and
Senegal). He argues the
[following](http://www.rocare.org/ChangingMindsets/pdf/ch13-ICTandChangingMindset.pdf)
(fr):

> il ne s'agit plus aujourd'hui de prouver que l'intégration des` TIC peut
> contribuer à l'amélioration de la qualité de l'éducation en Afrique mais de
> déterminer les voies et moyens pouvant pérenniser l'utilisation pédagogique
> des TIC à l'école, à toutes les écoles. Elle (l'etude) a aussi confirmé que
> la formation des enseignants aux nouvelles technologies n’est une priorité
> ni de l’école ni du gouvernement  
>  et que l’utilisation pédagogique des TIC tant par les enseignants que par
> les élèves reste  
>  faible en Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre.

It is not about proving that integrating ICT into the school curriculum
contributes to better quality of education in Africa anymore but to identify
the means and ways to sustain the use of ICT at school, every schools. It (
the study) also confirms that training teachers in new media is not a priority
for either schools or governments and that the use of ICT at school remains
minimal in west and central Africa.

_[Camedevelop](http://camedevelop.net.over-blog.com)_ further details Traoré’
s assessment in the case of Cameroon. He points to the fact that _l'école
Normale supérieure de Yaoundé_ has stil not completed the training of experts
in this field resulting in lack of teachers, lack of electricity in rural
areas and the cumbersome process to get computers into schools as the [main
causes for the delay in adopting ICT](http://camedevelop.net.over-
blog.com/article-informatique-et-education-au-cameroun-48487250.html) at
school (fr).

[Boukary Konaté](http://fasokan.maneno.org/) offers more optimistic news on
ICT and education in Mali. Konaté attended a workshop on ICT in Bamako (Mali)
dedicated to school teachers . The following video shows the substantial
interest shown for mastering information technology (fr):  

_Konaté_ also describes how young college [graduates learned more about
magnetic dipoles](http://fasokan.maneno.org/fra/articles/ind1268569169/) using
a simple Google search (fr). The students also mentioned an additional
advantage of adopting ICT tools was the ability to share information with all
classmates at once and organizing group meetings easily, thus reducing the
costs of calling each other.

The effort by French speaking countries to integrate ICT into development
projects is undeniable and not limited to the themes discussed above. However,
ICT development faces the same issue as other development themes when it comes
to scaling up the promising first steps. Sustainability and homogeneous
development are hard to achieve when infrastructure are still so unequally
distributed, especially between urban and rural areas.
