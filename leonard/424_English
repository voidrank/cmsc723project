Jordan has seen several
[weeks](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011128125157509196.html)
of [peaceful protests](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/18/jordan-
debating-the-countrys-leadership/) asking for a change in government led by
Prime Minister Samir Rifai. These protests were aimed at relief from high
prices which are increasing due to decreased government subsidies and
increased taxes. Given Jordan's high [public debt](http://www.gfmag.com/gdp-
data-country-reports/246-jordan-gdp-country-report.html#axzz1CivV5hVx),
running at 62.4% of GDP, Rifai's job was largely seen as decreasing public
debt. His connections with business as the leader of Jordan Dubai Capital led
to ire and accusations that he was more interested in corporations than public
good.

[Rifai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Rifai) is being
[replaced](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/01/us-jordan-
idUSTRE7103G720110201) with [Maarouf
Bakhit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marouf_al-Bakhit), a former Prime
Minister from 2005 to 2007, who has roots in the Jordanian military and as
Jordan's ambassador to Israel. Upon the announcement of the personnel change,
Twitter lit up with Jordanian reactions. Some expressed their appreciation for
PM Rifai's service to Jordan. Hanin Abu Shamat

Fadi Ghandour [praised](http://twitter.com/#!/fadig/status/32451936494030848)
the King for his decision:

Bilal Tarawneh[

flatly:

> Not expecting much #Jo #reformjo

And many, like Shadi Hamid, expressed
[skepticism](http://twitter.com/#!/shadihamid/status/32439027038687233) that
any new prime minister would be effective:

> #Jordan dismissing PM not a big deal. King does that like every year. PM
> doesn't matter much in Jordan anyway #reformJO
