While the official US response to the
[protests](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/29/egypt-in-photographs-
from-the-streets-of-cairo/) in Egypt is a desperate hope for
[stability](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-01-29-us-
egypt_N.htm), lesser televised American voices are supporting the protesters
in the land of the pyramids.

_Human Rights Now_ , the blog of Amnesty International USA, has a post by one
of its Middle East country specialists, Geoffrey Mock, who
[sees](http://blog.amnestyusa.org/waronterror/torture-and-abuse-in-egypt-the-
north-carolina-connection/) a specific American connection in the
developments:

> News that after five days of protests Omar Suleiman has been named vice
> president of Egypt is a reminder that the abuses that drove the people into
> the streets there had too much assistance from America, including right here
> in my home of North Carolina.
>
> According to journalist Stephen Grey, Suleiman was the Egyptian conduit for
> the US extraordinary rendition flights closely linked to torture.
>
> […]
>
> I was also reminded of the Johnston County flights when I received reports
> this week from people in Cairo of the tear gas canisters being used against
> them. Made in the USA, the canisters said.
>
> When you are watching the footage of the Egyptian people in the street,
> showing their frustration of 30 years of tyranny and abuse, it’s safe and
> appropriate to feel solidarity with them. But it’s not enough. To support
> the people in Cairo trying to change those abuses, we in the US and in North
> Carolina must end our own policies and acts that have sustained them.

In another [post](http://blog.amnestyusa.org/middle-east/take-action-and-
support-the-egyptian-people/) calling for action, Mock lists a number of
events organized in the US: “Demonstrations have already been held in San
Francisco, New York and DC,” he writes, adding that Amnesty International USA
organized a rally outside the Egyptian consulate in Chicago on Saturday,
January 29.

Rana Rizk, a native of Egypt's capital Cairo, joined her compatriots’ protests
from New York. She [writes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rana-
rizk/impressions-of-egypt-from_b_815866.html) in _The Huffington Post_ :

> I have been on the phone with my family in Egypt getting eyewitness reports
> from what they see out their window, very close to Tahrir square and I am
> reporting back international news I see online, since the Internet was and
> still remains cut off. They are completely isolated. I am writing before I
> go to sleep in New York City in commemoration and thought of all those who
> were injured today, arrested, or even killed. Of course, Egypt was a black
> hole today with no light coming out. I am scared to find out what happened
> to our courageous protesters today.
>
> […]
>
> Contrary to what I always believed, non-violent demonstration in the Middle
> East is possible and deserves great respect. Their demands must be answered
> and encouraged by the international community. And please, I say to the U.S.
> stop selling tear bombs to the Egyptian government. How can you encourage
> Mubarak to listen to the pleads of protesters and in the same breathe
> provide them with ammunition to harm those very same protesters?

Vermont lawyer Jack McCullough
[worries](http://rationalresistance.blogspot.com/2011/01/egypt-what-happens-
now.html#links) for the future of Egypt's democracy in his blog _Rational
Resistance_ :

> I have the feeling I've seen this movie before. A dictator who is largely
> friendly to the United States and its foreign policy goals is in trouble,
> shaken by massive street demonstrations.
>
> It's not quite the same as Iran, because in this case the dictator wasn't
> installed by the United States. Still, things are not looking too stable for
> Hosni Mubarak.
>
> […]
>
> It's almost impossible not to identify with the demonstrators in the street,
> to say, as a friend of mine just observed, we are all Egyptians now.
>
> If you're old enough you remember the same feeling watching the students in
> Tehran, risking murder by Pahlavi's SAVAK. I sure did. In fact, when I was
> in law school I had the chance to represent an Iranian student who was
> arrested on campus at the University of Michigan for wearing a mask at an
> anti-Pahlavi demonstration.
>
> […]
>
> Is there any chance that Mubarak can be escorted out without creating and
> Iranian-style Islamic dictatorship?

Geoffrey Mock, quoted earlier, has a
[response](http://blog.amnestyusa.org/middle-east/egyptian-protests-
day-3-next-steps/). “This was a protest that crossed class, ideology and
religion, and that is what scares the government.”
