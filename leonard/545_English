The [Yamanote Line](urhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line) is a 34.5 km
train loop that connects many of Tokyo’s major urban areas and subway lines.
Its trains come every several minutes to the 29 stations, both clockwise and
anti-clockwise. (Explore this [interactive

This recent Global Voices
[link](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/31/japan-photography-project-
yamanote-loop/) to the [Yamanote Loop](http://yamanoteloop.com/) project
spurred feedback from readers on other projects that were inspired by the
Line.

This post introduces several personal projects that were published online in
English and Japanese. To my knowledge, all of the online photography projects
are by non-Japanese living in Tokyo, while native Tokyoites favored
chronicling walking projects on their blogs.

**160yen – A Day on Tokyo's Yamanote Line**

This is [a series
of](http://www.flickr.com/photos/fabuchan/sets/72157623853236936/) black and
white photographs by Fabrizio Quagliuso (a.k.a. fabuchan) in April 2010, now
available as [a book](http://www.fabrizioq.com/160yenbook.html).

> I started this project because I was fascinated by the idea that by being
> always on the same line and going round and round in the loop, as the day
> progressed I would have been able to see the whole range of Tokyo life just
> passing in front of me.

**Alexandre Gervais**

Alexandre Gervais has two projects, [Girls of the
Yamanote](http://alexandregervais.com/girls-of-the-yamanote/) and
[Surroundings of the Yamanote](http://alexandregervais.com/surroundings-of-
the-yamanote/).

> Since I first came to Tokyo in 2007, I always found that the Yamanote line

> Shibuya Crossing and others but if there’s one thing that’s omnipresent in
> everyone’s life in Tokyo, it’s the Yamanote.

**Ghosts of Tokyo**

A photography project by [Olivier
Théreaux](http://ot.zoy.org/2003/Ghosts_of_Tokyo/making_of.html) in 2003,
which he calls a “a visual haiku, a photographic poem telling a story of
ghosts in the City”.

> This book started as a project to document the “other” face of Tokyo, by
> walking around the Yamanote, the ultra-busy circular train line often
> thought of as the heart (or more appropriately, the crown) of the city, and
> taking pictures of the areas between the stations, when the common images
> were too often close to the stations.

Some bloggers use the Line as a way to explore Tokyo, such as [the Traveling
Tales
blog](http://travelingrant.blogspot.com/search/label/Yamanote%20Project), the
[Soul Sauce](http://tokyosoulsauce.blogspot.com/search/label/Yamanote%20Line)
blog, and [My Year in
Japan](http://myyearinjapan.wordpress.com/category/trips/domestic/tokyo-
places/yamanote-sen/) blog. Wataru Fujiki has [beautiful
illustrations](http://www.ne.jp/asahi/fjk/art/YMT-index.htm) [ja].

In [Yamanote Line Sounds](http://www.rickbenedict.com/jams/?p=701), Rick
Benedict collected Japanese and English on-train announcement for each
station. They are offered online and as ringtones. There are [alarm
clocks](http://jeansnow.net/2006/06/19/yamanote-line-alarm-clock/) and [piggy
banks](http://www.tokyomango.com/tokyo_mango/2008/11/piggy-bank-play.html),
too.

A look into the Japanese blogosphere brought forth many entries of people
walking around the entire line. For example, Mari from the Watashi to Tokyo
blog [completed the
walk](http://smt.blogs.com/mari_diary/2005/04/urban_challenge.html) in 14
hours, starting at 7:00 in the morning at Shinjuku Station. The blogger at
WADA-blog [posted](http://wada.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2006/05/post_b0b3.html)
[ja] walked it in 11 hours and 20 minutes, excluding meals and breaks, taking
64,755 steps over 42.73 kilometers. Remember, sitting through a complete loop
of the Yamanote Line takes around an hour.

Besides the slew of noteworthy projects, the Yamanote Line has inspired other
things in a Tokyoite’s daily life. There’s a drinking game called the
[Yamanote Line Game](http://gaijintonic.com/2009/01/03/japanese-drinking-
games-no5-the-yamanote-sen-game/) and some might fondly recall going on a
[Yamanote Line Date](http://ameblo.jp/shippainikki/entry-10374772673.html)
[ja] during their high school years.
