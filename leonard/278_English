In France and elsewhere, the [terrifying
pictures](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12725646) of the Friday
11 March, 2011 earthquake and tsunami have made Japanese expatriates around
the world worried. Many of them spent the day of the disaster trying to
contact their loved ones through the Internet, and since then have been
working to bring their compatriots some mental support.

From the beginning, helicopters from Japanese NHK public television channel
broadcast the destructive wave's advance live. This footage has been picked up
and played repeatedly on [French news
channels](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OexjUGA-Efg) [fr], allowing Japanese
expatriates to [follow the situation's development
live](http://crisiscampparis.posterous.com/les-chaines-de-television-sur-
internet-pour-s) [fr].

Photographer and blogger _Tono Mariko_ , living in Paris, France,
[describes](http://tonomariko.exblog.jp/16041598/) [jp] how she learned of the
news:

> フランス人の友人からのメールで起きました。
>
> 朝から地震のニュースを見ています。

I was awakened by an email from a French friend.

I've been watching the news since this morning.

Mariko immediately tried to contact her family back home in Japan through the
Internet:

> なかなか電話が通じませんでしたが、家族とは無事に連絡が取れました。
>
> 海外にいながら限られた情報しかないので何も出来ないけれど、今日はネットやTwitterなどのありがたさを実感。

It was hard to get a hold of them by phone but I finally managed to call my
family.

I find it hard to get information when I am abroad. But I now know why it is
important to use Twitter and the Internet.

Far away from their home country, members of the Japanese community in France
have felt powerless during this event.

On her blog, a Japanese woman married to a French man shows her support with
pictures of flowers to soften the violence of the images on television, in [an
entry](http://franceotok.exblog.jp/14420656/) [jp], whose lack of title
reflects the author's shock:

> どんな言葉や行為が心を救えるかもわかりません。
>
> ただただ一方的にお心を強く持たれるよう祈ることしかできません。

I do not know what to do or say to help comfort them.
