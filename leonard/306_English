The Libyan people's uprising against Colonel Muammar Al Gaddafi may or may not
have begun in Benghazi, but the country's second-largest city is the political
heart and rebellious soul of the movement. It is home to the country's first
anti-Gaddafi newspaper and the anti-Gaddafi transitional government. With once
fast-charging rebel forces now under considerable attacks by Gaddafi forces,
however, Benghazi could become a last stand for Libyan freedom.

‘Born in Tunisia, grew up in Egypt…now I'm sacrificing myself in Libya…my name
is freedom’ – Benghazi graffiti, from Twit Pic.

  
On Wednesday, March 17, Benghazi saw more attacks by the air from forces loyal
to the Gaddafi regime. Gaddafi himself and his son Saif
[predicted](http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2011/03/17/closing-in-on-
benghazi/) the city would fall within 48 hours.

Here's a few Twitter reports from people on the ground or in contact with
those in Benghazi.

Reports came across that pro-Gaddafi planes had been shot down:

Here is a video, uploaded by [Feb 17,
2011](http://www.youtube.com/user/17Feb2011), that claims to show a plane shot
down in a Benghazi suburb.

There's also a report of a counter-attack by anti-Gaddafi forces.

No one dares think what Gaddafi forces will do if Benghazi falls. Ali, a young
man, took part in early days of protests and was
[arrested](http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/03/17/141923.html) on
February 17. While in prison, he says, government agents severally beat him
and others (including using electric shock) and eventually left the group for
dead. Ali remains in a wheelchair. But the 25 other people he was arrested
with — including at least one man in his 70s — all perished.

The US-based human rights organization Human Rights Watch
[warned](http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/benghazi-at-risk-of-atrocities-if-
retaken-hrw) that the Gaddafi regime could carry out great atrocities if
Benghazi is retaken. The group, along with members of Amnesty International,
the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Fronteirers, pulled its staff out of the city.

People have also been moving desperately across the border:

> ns fled into #Egypt yesterday, many families scared Benghazi to b bombed. v
> @melissarfleming (via @Refugees – UN Refugee Agency)

However, the city appears to be better defended than other rebel positions.
Fred Abrahams, a special adviser to Human Rights Watch
[said](http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/benghazi-at-risk-of-atrocities-if-
retaken-hrw):

> “We know that the rebels in Benghazi are better armed and more professional,
> not like the other young men who ran to the front. We know the people who
> started this will stay until the end, but people are deeply afraid. They
> know Gaddafi and they know this kind of rebellion can only end in victory or
> defeat.”

Some commentators also claim all is not lost for Libyan freedom. From Libya
watcher [Fat Belly Man](http://www.fatbellyman.com/#libya_update):

> Pronouncements from Saif Gaddafi that the uprising will be over by the end
> of the week are repeated without analysis or criticism. Three things are
> becoming clear though:
>
> * Saif Gaddafi is engaged in a psychological war against the revolutionaries
> and their supporters. This part of the battle has assumed huge importance
> for the regime and is making an impact in the West. Some politicians,
> especially Neo conservatives, are also using this propaganda to persue their
> own agenda  
>  * The Libyan regime is engaged in subtle goading of the West. A military
> attack would be a tonic for the Gaddafis, it would galvanise their
> demoralised support and bring the indecisive back into their fold. Saif in
> particular understands that that total victory for either side in the
> uprising would be problematic for the West and is playing on those fears.  
>  * When a sober assessment is conducted, one sees that the military
> situation on the ground does not bear any relation to that claimed by the
> Gaddafis or the media. The battle in the East has been confined within the
> same strip of land for days. It also has to be borne in mind that superior
> weapons are all well and good but it needs boots on the ground to hold
> territory and the regime does not seem to have the numbers needed.

This psychological war waged by the Gaddafi family is creating a feeling of
helplessness amongst outside countries, Fat Belly Man argues.

Here's some more Twitter reports on the general defenses of Benghazi.

One Tweep asks where the defected Libyan forces?

While the United Nations Security Council and NATO members debate the
possibility of instituting a no-fly zone, there are some members of the
rebellion who do not want to see forces in Libya.
