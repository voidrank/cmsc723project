![AIDS Ribbon](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/12/68997406_86baf89647_m.jpg)While it's true that most
people know by now that HIV/AIDS poses a threat, [World AIDS
Day](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/annual/world_aids_day/en/), which
takes place today, attempts to focus the world's attention on this disease for
a day and show just how big a threat still persists.

There has been progress in combating the disease since it was first identified
in the early 80s, but HIV/AIDS remains a major public health issue. Over [33
million](http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/FeatureStories/archive/2009/20091124_pr_EpiUpdate.asp)
people are currently living with HIV worldwide, almost [70
percent](http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/EpiUpdate/EpiUpdArchive/2009/default.asp)
of who live in sub-Saharan Africa. People with HIV are living longer though,
in part because of the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy. To
highlight the need for universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment, care and
prevention, the [theme](http://www.avert.org/world-aids-day.htm) of this
year's World AIDS Day is ‘Universal Access and Human Rights.’

Bloggers globally have used World AIDS Day as an opportunity to share their
thoughts on not only this disease, but the significance of this day. Many of
these blogs are included on Global Voices Google [map](http://is.gd/545x4) of
HIV-positive bloggers and groups who blog about the disease, which has been
updated for World AIDS Day. Charlie Dale, blogging on _My Journey with Judy…_
from the United States,
[reflects](http://myjourneywithjudy.blogspot.com/2009/11/world-aids-
day-2009.html) on the significance of World AIDS Day.

> “Somehow over the years I guess I have grown complacent to what this day

> and awareness and attention was brought to this monster killer.

> Over the years though the media like the rest of us I guess has grown overly

But Claire Keeton, blogging for South Africa’s _Sunday Times_ ,
[says](http://blogs.timeslive.co.za/hiv/2009/11/27/lets-remember-hiv-the-
other-364-days/) there is still an important role for World AIDS Day.

> “It’s that time of year when Christmas decorations flood the shops and red
> AIDS ribbons come out. Tuesday is World AIDS Day.
>
> Some people with HIV/AIDS and activists object to World AIDS Day –
> essentially saying it allows people to ignore the epidemic the rest of the
> year, as long as they remember it for a single day.
>
> Paying lip service. Window dressing. Look at the Onion cover in that light.
>
> From my side, World AIDS Day does have advantages. It’s the one time of the
> year that all media make space for HIV/AIDS stories.”

Many bloggers have done just that, made space on their blogs to share their
experiences about this disease. Aderyn Verwood from Germany, blogging on
_Vintage Verwood_ ,
[says](http://aderynverwood.wordpress.com/2009/11/29/world-aids-day-2009/)
that until her good friend was diagnosed with HIV, she didn’t pay much
attention to it:

> “Like most people, I knew about HIV, but the role it played in my life was
> too insignificant to ever become more than a distant, abstract threat that
> seemingly did not belong to my environment. Now, no day goes past that I
> don’t think of it consciously, that I don’t hope for improvement of already
> existing therapies or for a breakthrough in scientific research, so that a
> cure might be found…To my friend, I’d just like to say: I hope that many
> decades from now, we will sit together, old and wrinkly, laughing about the
> times when we were young. I love you.”

Others took a less personal approach and blogged to raise awareness and spread
the facts. Jessica Joseph, blogging on _Alien in The Caribbean_ from Trinidad
and Tobago, wrote a three-part exploration of sex and sexuality in the
Caribbean in the days leading up to World AIDS Day. In this [first part,](
http://jessiegirl.blogspot.com/2009/11/sex-on-brain-1-birth-of-shame-
secrets.html) she looks at where the shame and secrets regarding sex come
from:

> “Some of the questions I would like to investigate are: Where exactly did
> our prudery and hypocrisy come from? What are the elements of sexual
> attraction? What are the dynamics of gender and sexual orientation? Some of
> the resolutions I would to make are: Sexuality and spirituality are not
> mutually exclusive. Good sex is also safe sex. HIV/Aids is a viral
> representation of a deeper syndrome and its cure lies in a holistic approach
> to sexuality even it means the painful re-breaking and re-setting of a bone
> (no pun intended) that was badly cast for a very long time.”

Some bloggers used art to express how they feel on World AIDS Day. Last year
Richard Kearns, blogging on _HAVVACC_ , wrote [this
poem](http://havvacc.wordpress.com/2009/08/30/earns-reads-world-aids-day-
poem-%e2%80%9cskipping-stones%e2%80%9d-to-la-city-council-011/) in honor of
the day and says he plans to write a new poem this year. Sinthalunda, a poet
in Malawi, [posts](http://sinthalunda.blogspot.com/2009/10/experience-
aids.html) this poem:

> “Here from this musty village  
>  Come golden stars  
>  Who dance the same rhythm  
>  From far beyond the horizon;  
>  Their light sound gets louder  
>  As they walk to school  
>  For the beat of lessons  
>  Round the circle of subjects.
>
> From this forgotten compound  
>  Come complex joys  
>  From children whose nose-dust  
>  Has been cleaned by wind's awareness.  
>  For now, the way of knowledge  
>  In the world of education  
>  Has taught them to sense  
>  The voice of silenced victims.”

To encourage more bloggers to write about HIV/AIDS on all 365 days of the
year, not just World AIDS Day, this past summer [Rising
Voices](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org) released [“Blogging
Positively,”](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/guides/) a collection of
case studies, interviews and best practices about citizen media related to
HIV/AIDS. The guide highlights leaders in the HIV-positive community, contains
tips for workshop facilitators and teachers and provides resources to help new
bloggers get started.
