[We learn from Joseph Appiah-
Dolphyne](http://www.africanews.com/site/user_profile/4040) about a dispute
that could break out between Ghana and neighboring Ivory Coast, if immediate
steps are not taken to enter into appropriate negotiations to redefine the
international boundary between the two nations.

Ghana's Western neighbor [Ivory
Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire) is reportedly laying
claims to portions of the huge oil wealth in the deep waters of the [Western
Region of Ghana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Region_%28Ghana%29).

In a move to save the situation, Ghana has begun an urgent move to pass a new
law that seeks to establish the Ghana Boundary Commission to undertake
negotiations to determine and demarcate Ghana’s land boundaries and de-limit
Ghana’s maritime boundaries.

Ghana’s Parliament has therefore been tasked to race against time to pass the
Ghana Boundary Commission Bill under a certificate of urgency.

The morning of the news; I twittered about it
[here](http://twitter.com/MacJordaN/status/10011031068);

> West Africa: Ivory Coast lays claim to Ghana's oil <http://bit.ly/djVBzu>

The news of Ivory Coast’s claim to parts of Ghana’s [oil
fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_field "Oil field") comes just days
after United States operator [Vanco Energy](http://www.vancoenergy.com/)
struck oil in the deep-water Dzata-1 well, off Ghana’s [Cape Three
Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Three_Points "Cape Three Points")
near Ivory Coast, further boosting the oil wealth in Ghana’s booming offshore
Tano basin.

A few days after this news; another news item was on air from Vanco Energy
dismissing the threat of Ghana’s Oil Find. A twitter update from
[Peacefmonline](http://twitter.com/peacefmonline/status/10169598102) reads;

> Vanco Ghana Dismisses Threat to Ghana’s Find …. <http://bit.ly/bPLPEq>

[Joseph Appiah-Dolphyne](http://www.africanews.com/site/user_profile/4040)
once again reported on this new update from the Oil Firm.

He writes;

> Petroleum exploration firm, Vanco Ghana Limited, has dismissed suggestions
> that its oil field in the Western Region is at the centre of a possible
> boundary dispute between Ghana and the Ivory Coast. The company said its
> oilfield, known as Gyata 1, is so far away from the maritime boundary
> between the two countries that it cannot be the subject of any dispute.

He also quoted the Country Manager of Vanco Energy; Mr. Kofi Afenu as saying;

> The Ivorian authorities are only seeking negotiations with Ghana over the
> Jubilee oilfield, which is owned by [Kosmos
> Energy](http://www.kosmosenergy.com/ghana.html).

Tatamkulua  
[posts an article](http://tatamkulu.blogspot.com/2010/03/ghana-and-ivory-
coast-fight-over-oil.html) from the Chronicle quoting Alhaji Collins Dauda,
Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, saying that Ghana's boundary with
Ivory Coast had not been clearly demarcated.

Gayle [writes about the topic](http://gisforghana.blogspot.com/2010/03/making-
sense-of-oil-discoveries-in_09.html) remembering gas fields dispute between
Australia and East Timor:

She hopes that the dispute will be resolved faster that Australia and East
Timor:
