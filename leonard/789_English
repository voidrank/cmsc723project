The [crackdown](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/11/thailand-bloggers-
document-violent-clashes/) on the Red Shirt protesters in Thailand last
Saturday by the military turned violent killing 21 people and injuring almost
900 individuals. The clash took place in a busy street in Bangkok which
allowed bystanders and tourists to document the violence.

Both the soldiers and protesters accuse each other of using real bullets and
hand grenades. We may never know who is telling the truth but the videos below
allow us to view some of the violent scenes last Saturday.

Via _Bangkok Pundit_ , a brief
[description](http://us.asiancorrespondent.com/bangkok-pundit-blog/videos-
from-the-saturday-crackdown) of the videos

> This video (at the 39 second mark) shows some kind of firefight and then
> some kind of explosive device (M79 grenade?) landing in the middle of a
> group of soldiers then soldiers retreating….
>
> …Another video where you can see some guys dressed in dark clothing (red
> guards? or the third hand Panitan was referring too?) in the distance. At
> least one has an automatic gun and fires (based on other video of the area
> from earlier) in the direction of the soldiers.

At _Vaitor’s_ weblog, a [journalist](http://www.vaitor.com/?p=1501) who has
been living in Bangkok for two years was shot in the arm while documenting the
clash

_FACT – Freedom Against Censorship Thailand_
[blames](http://facthai.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/factorial-bloodbath-in-
bangkok-20-dead-more-than-807-injured-so-far/) all the major political forces
for the violence which took place last Saturday

_Jotman_ believes the Red Shirts could gain [more
supporters](http://jotman.blogspot.com/2010/04/bangkok-protest-crackdown-
evidence.html) from the provinces

> The cause of the red shirts has been consecrated in blood. The movement now
> has its martyrs. Red shirts can be expected to arm themselves better in
> preparation for any future street confrontation. Many more supporters of the
> rural opposition movement, privy to evidence of the heartless brutality

> countryside, sickened by Bangkok's denials, are bound to step out of the
> woodwork. Tensions within the Thai armed forces may lead to outright
> fractures.

Saksith Saiyasombut thinks that the Red Shirts are no longer mere supporters
of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra as the movement is now a loose
coalition of forces which want to
[overthrow](http://saiyasombut.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/no-end-in-sight-some-
personal-thoughts/) the elitist system of government

> What many like to neglect is that the red shirt movement is now more than
> just a proxy mob of Thaksin, not just a tool of anyone to overthrow the
> current government. It is a true unavoidable force in Thai politics with
> legitimate claims, with a sound political consciousness that is now haunting
> the political elites and bureaucrats for failing to recognize the sign of
> times. The problems cannot be solely linked back to Thaksin (as he is trying
> to promote himself as the beacon of freedom and democracy, while there is no
> doubt that he is not) – it is a collective failure!
