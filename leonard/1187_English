content/uploads/2009/09/mccurry-resto.jpg)Malaysia’s Federal Court has
[ruled](http://www.blogtactic.com/2009/09/mcdonald-loses-court-battle-in-
malaysia.html) that McDonald’s trademark name was not violated by McCurry, a
local Indian restaurant which is popular in Kuala Lumpur.

McCurry, which opened in 1999, was sued by McDonald's in 2001. According to
the owners of McCurry, the “Mc” prefix in the restaurant’s name stands for
Malaysian Chicken Curry.

Here are some reactions of bloggers to the historic court ruling:

_As Suanie Sees It_ believes that some Davids in David vs Goliath fights are
merely [opportunists](http://www.suanie.net/2009/09/09/mcdonalds-and-
mccurry/):

> I'm like any other David, I love a good triumph over Goliaths. But sometimes
> I feel that certain Davids are merely opportunists, and when confronted they
> would argue that the Goliaths are major international corporations and have
> endless money, hence could afford to bully them. Of course there are many
> Goliaths who do that and should be stumped, but in some cases the Davids are
> no better. When it comes to McDonald’s vs McCurry, I feel that this is one
> of them

Commenting on a post, Melissa
[believes](http://www.suanie.net/2009/09/09/mcdonalds-and-
mccurry/#comment-555903) that many people know that McCurry is different from
McDonald’s:

> Of course they were totally riding on McDonalds’ wave, but considering the
> food they serve is completely different and I’m sure a lot of people know
> how different they both are and don’t associate them with each other, I
> guess I don’t see a problem with it

Eyeris [wonders](http://www.suanie.net/2009/09/09/mcdonalds-and-
mccurry/#comment-555911) why McDonald’s did not sue another local “Mc”
restaurant:

> There’s another restaurant in Jelatek called McKandar… but just because it’s
> not as popular as McCurry, I suppose McD’s didn’t bother suing them. So does
> this mean McD’s only sues companies with the ‘Mc’ if they are doing well,
> perhaps better than any nearby McD outlets? Hmmm

_Anonymous X_ [advises](http://anonymousxwrites.blogspot.com/2009/09/mccurry-
vs-mcdonalds-and-guess-who-wins.html) McCurry to open outlets in the US and UK

> “McCurry” should really consider expanding its business to US & UK. Many
> love to read such a heart-warming story about how a giant multinational
> company is utterly embarrassed by being so picky against a local enterprise
> who just wants to use the prefix “Mc”.
>
> It's just a prefix, for goodness’ sake!

Carl Parkes fears McCurry-like restaurants will
[open](http://friskodude.blogspot.com/2009/09/mccurry-restoran-wins-over-
mcdonalds-in.html) in other Asian countries

> Silly stuff, but if McDonalds doesn't defend it's franchise around the

> Bangkok.

_The Bluesman_ [asks](http://thebluesmansays.blogspot.com/2009/09/mcdonald-vs-
mccurry.html) if other local restaurants will be inspired by McCurry’s victory

> Will there be other outlets wanting to use the prefix ‘Mc’ now that the
> prefix appears to be no more a monopoly by the McDonald's. My favourite
> siamese restaurant Mek Habsah TomYam maybe wanting to change their name to
> McHabsah TomYam to lend themselves with some international credence or
> something. Or maybe we can now have other ‘Mc’ related names in our other
> local food chains say like McNasiLemak, McSatay, McRotiCanai,
> McFriedKwayTiau, McChickenRice, and so the challenge to McDonald's seems
> endless.

The blogger writes that consumers will decide if McCurry clones will survive
the market

> But business is still business, which means that finally it's the people
> like us, the customers, who will decide as to whether or not any business
> concern will continue to exist in the market place.

_My Journal_ [theorizes](http://wanhashimblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/happy-day-
for-mccurry.html) on why McDonald’s was persistent in its suit versus McCurry

> I think, McDonald insist on pursuing this matter because they also one day
> would roll out their new product called McCurry. Since they also lost the
> battle, they have to give their dish another name, may be “McDonald Curry”.

After learning about the court ruling, _Malaysian Life_
[exclaims](http://toomalaysian.blogspot.com/2009/09/malaysia-bolehmccurry-
bests-mcdonalds.html)

> Wow, I don't believe it but it's true. I guess it is possible to beat an
> international company in a lawsuit.

Twitter reactions from Malaysia:

> _[dannyfoo](http://twitter.com/dannyfoo/statuses/3861125592)_ : Did
> McDonalds realize their suit just gives McCurry free publicity and bigger

>  _[hasyudeen](http://twitter.com/hasyudeen/statuses/3851609111)_ : When it

>  _[davinarul](http://twitter.com/davinarul/statuses/3837504534)_ : McD might

>  _[davinarul](http://twitter.com/davinarul/statuses/3837343743)_ : Does this

>  _[altimet](http://twitter.com/altimet/statuses/3834413941)_ : I'm going
