Six young video game designers in Costa Rica are looking for crowd-sourced
funding for [TweetLand](http://tweetlandgame.com/), their real-time twitter
powered games.

The games are called Route 140 and LoveCity and both use real time twitter
updates to influence actions that take place during the game. In Route 140
cars race to get to the finish line, but if someone writes an update on
twitter about zombies, meteors or car crashes (among others) beware! It will
be reflected in the game. In Love City, an Anti-Care Bear feeds on different
“hate” updates to increase power and get new weapons but loving and caring
tweets will power its enemies.

Costa Rican blogger Cristian Cambronero of [Fusil de Chispas
](http://www.fusildechispas.com/2011/04/un-juego-basado-en-twitter-hecho-en-
costa-rica/)interviewed the creators asking them about their decision to
crowd-source funding for the games:

> Para reunir el dinero [decidieron recurrir al sitio de crowdfunding
> KickStarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nestorvc/tweet-land-
> the-first-set-of-games-that-play-with-r). Pero ¿por qué no recurrir a
> inversionistas? “TweetLand es un proyecto que se alimenta de experiencias de
> la comunidad web de una forma colaborativa. Es decir, no es sino gracias al
> apoyo de todos, que la plataforma de juegos funciona. Nos pareció que lo más
> coherente, era que un proyecto de naturaleza colaborativa como este, fuera
> fundado de la misma forma, con la colaboración de todos”, dice Néstor
> Villalobos.

To raise the money [they decided to turn to crowdfunding site
Kickstarter.com.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nestorvc/tweet-land-the-
first-set-of-games-that-play-with-r) But, why not turn to investors?
“TweetLand is a project fed by experiences from the web community in a
collaborative fashion. Which means it's thanks to everyone's support that the
game platform works. We figured that it was the most coherent to fund a
project with a collaborative nature like this one the same way, with
everyone's help”, says Néstor Villalobos.

It's not the first time a Costa Rican initiative has used Kickstarter.com to
raise funds. A recent successful use was for the movie [The
Return](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/17/costa-rica-crowdfunding-
costa-rican-film-el-regreso/) by Hernán Jiménez, which managed to raise far
more than their original goal of 40, 000 US dollars (USD) needed to edit and
make the movie ready for theaters and distribution.

On their [Kickstarter.com site for TweetLand
](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nestorvc/tweet-land-the-first-set-of-
games-that-play-with-r) they explain their vision and what use they'll give
the 7,000 USD they are trying to raise. The 6 young designers have previously
won awards and recognition for previous projects in their daytime jobs, and
are now turning to the web to make their independent project TweetLand a
reality. They tell more about the game in their promotional
