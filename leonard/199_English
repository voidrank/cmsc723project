On Saturday 16 April, 2011, Malaysia’s ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition
[won the state
election](http://elections.thestar.com.my/sarawak/news/story.asp?file=/2011/4/16/sarawakpolls/20110416170738&sec=sarawakpolls)
in [Sarawak](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/07/malaysia-state-
election-brings-another-sex-scandal/), winning 55 of the 71 seats contested to
retain its control and two-thirds majority over the Pakatan Rakyat (PR)
opposition alliance.

Blogger _OutSyed The Box_ [wrote on Sunday 17 April,
that](http://syedsoutsidethebox.blogspot.com/2011/04/sarawak-election-
results.html) the BN successfully used blogs to counter misinformation, a
similar strategy employed by the opposition in the federal general election in
2008:

> Granted that the Pakatan folks have their legitimate grouses and the BN
> folks also have their legitimate grouses but the Pakatan folks were also
> using fake information and really dirty tricks to win the vote. The BN
> Bloggers were most useful to counter false news and dirty tricks like these
> at light speed. Within minutes the Blogs were updated and fighting back.

He also called for respect for everyone’s votes.

> Looking at the voting patterns over the past few years we cannot ignore the
> consistent resoluteness among the Chinese to vote for the Opposition. This
> is my view: I do respect the Chinese voters who stood their ground most
> firmly and voted for the Opposition. Just like we all must respect all the
> people who voted for the BN. Malaysia is a democracy. Let us not forget
> that. Everyone has the right to vote their conscience. And we must always
> safeguard the peoples’ right to freely vote their conscience.

_Turtleinvestor_ [shared a similar
opinion](http://turtleinvestor888.blogspot.com/2011/04/sarawak-state-election-
dissapointed-or.html) on the 16 April:

> Yeah, BN won 2/3. Am I dissapointed? Yes, I'm but then I will have to
> respect the decision of people. There is no point to speculate whether the
> ruling party has used dirty tactics or not. If people have not been happy
> not matter how much they have been “bribed”, they will vote against people
> who do not work for them at the ballots — just like what they did in 2008.
> Blame it Sarawak is a big state, not that internet savvy yet or etc, the
> opposition will need to reflect what went wrong, accept accountability and
> responsibility. They need to fight again in another day.

Richard Loh [thinks that](http://ousel.blogspot.com/2011/04/10th-sarawak-
state-election-2011.html) it is simply not good enough for the Opposition to
claim that a ‘political tsunami’ has arrived in Malaysia (following the 2008
federal general election when the BN lost its two-thirds majority) without
actually making progress.

> For Pakatan Rakyat to make inroads into Sarawak and Sabah or rather to gain
> state power there are many challenges and obstacles that PR has to face and
> fend off and by just shouting and claiming that the tsunami has arrived is
> simply not good enough. The best bet is to work with the local leaders,
> members and political parties that are serious in wanting change as they are
> the ones who know better the in-things of their states. TALK less and WORK
> more. By talking too much you allow the media especially umno's to spin
> more.
>
> It is hope that Pakatan Rakyat will not stay jubilant over the small gain
> for too long but start looking into what went wrong for their failure to
> deny Umno/BN/Taib the two third majority, if I am not wrong, this is their
> main objective.

_Khoo Kay Peng_ , however, [does
not](http://khookaypeng.blogspot.com/2011/04/consequences-of-sarawak-state-
elections.html) view the election result as an outright win by the BN:

> The Sarawak outcome has effectively cancelled out the gains PM Najib had
> enjoyed in the last couple by-elections. The fact that the coalition has
> performed worse than 2006 is going to put additional pressure on his
> leadership of UMNO and Barisan Nasional which has a history of pushing out
> leaders who perform poorly at the polls. Abdullah Badawi regime lost just 8
> seats in the 2006 state elections.
>
> Najib cannot afford to call a GE without solving the issue of leadership
> transition and a leader overstaying his presence (Sarawak Chief Minister,
> Abdul Taib Mahmud, who has been in power since 1981). However, it is going
> to be very difficult to force down Taib. His party has just delivered a
> clean slate in the state elections.
>
> General election which has been slated for mid-half of this year may be
> shelved temporarily until the coalition has digested the post-election
> analysis for Sarawak. According to UMNO Youth Chief Khairy Jamaluddin, the
> leadership transition promise in Sarawak must be fulfilled as soon as
> possible. The speed in which Taib installed himself as a Chief Minister of
> Sarawak is going to derail the promise.
>
> Najib and the rest of BN component parties need to be able to reenergize
> their parties by recruiting young, credible, smart and energetic new members
> and candidates or risk suffering a worse defeat than 2008.

Popular Malaysian blogger Ahirudin Attan [took a more neutral
stance](http://www.rockybru.com.my/2011/04/bn-retains-sarawak-with-two-
thirds.html) in his blog:

> They said PR won seven more seats to bring the tally 55-15-1 (the one seat
> is won by an Independent candidate). I reminded them that PR went into the
> Sarawak election bragging that it was going to strip Taib Mahmud naked and
> end BN's reign.
>
> This morning, Sarawak awakes to the same Chief Minister who has guided the
> state to where it is today for the last 3 decades. Taib has promised to step
> down after the election, and after finding the perfect successor. The
> Sarawak people have trusted him for 30 years, so they have no reason to
> doubt him now.
>
> Taib will have to keep his word. No two ways about it.
>
> Whether he leads the state into the next General Election does not matter.
> The Sarawak people have spoken. That's what matters most.
