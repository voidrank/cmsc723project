Millions and millions of low-income, unbanked people stand to benefit (and
maybe prosper?) from the development of mobile financial services in the next
years. Many people already transfer payments and remittances through mobile
phones, and even store and save money on them as a virtual bank. And the
number of people across Africa, Latin America and Asia, without a bank account
but _with_ a mobile phone, is set to to grow to 1.7 billion by 2012, according
to [a recent study by CGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) and the GSM
Association (GSMA)](http://www.cgap.org/p/site/c/template.rc/1.26.10806/ ).

There have been several success stories in African and Asian markets, and many
efforts to expand, replicate or launch similar services, but stiff opposition
from bankers and regulators has slowed development in many instances. In
[India, for example](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-
industry/telecom/Finmin-hangs-up-on-mobile-banking/articleshow/5273574.cms ),
the Reserve Bank of India has opposed allowing mobile-based financial services
(via non-bank led model) saying it would be difficult to control the creation
of credit outside the banking system. The Indian Home Ministry additionally
expressed concerns regarding misuse and the possible security implications.

It is doubtful whether such obstacles can delay the progress of m-banking
services for long, but meanwhile there are several technological, logistical,
and security challenges that must be ironed out to make these alternative
financial services more inclusive for the unbanked sector. Furthermore,
another [CGAP study](http://www.cgap.org/p/site/c/template.rc/1.26.5102/) from
February of two of the fastest growing mobile banking networks serving poor
people – [M-PESA](http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=745) in Kenya and
[GCash](http://www.g-cash.com.ph/) in the Philippines – revealed that despite
their rapid growth, the providers continue to face difficulties turning a
profit as well as paying sustainable fees to the small shops and agents that
earn commissions on transactions.

**M-PESA in Kenya**

One of the most quoted success stories of
[m-banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_banking#Mobile_banking_business_models)
for the unbanked has been Safaricom's
[M-PESA](http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=745 ) in Kenya.

Since M-PESA launched in 2007, the service has impacted the lives of many East
Africans, a significant number of whom, until then, had been unserved by the
traditional banking system. By March 2009, M-PESA already had [6.8 million
registered users](http://mm.inwent-iij-lab.org/group2/2009/08/03/m-pesa-
revives-lives-of-east-africans/ ) in Kenya and that number is growing by the
day.

In the video below, John, a Nairobi taxi driver and an M-PESA customer [talks
to](http://mmublog.org/africa-east/understanding-the-mobile-money-customer-an-
interview-with-john-the-taxi-driver/ ) _Paul Lieshman_ and _Seema Desai_ about
his use of the service and what impact it has had on his life.

The “early adopters” of M-PESA were most likely migrant workers in need of an
economical yet reliable channel to send money “back home”. However, the
benefits of the service [soon drew
others](http://technology.cgap.org/2008/06/17/why-has-m-pesa-become-so-
popular-in-kenya/), who were otherwise neglected by the traditional banking
system. This innovative financial service was a convenient, easily accessible
and more economical channel, than the ‘distant’, traditional banking systems
that had failed to include them in their ambit.

**Exploring future options for the unbanked**

Using Philippines as a case in point, the _CGAP-GSMA Mobile Money Market
Sizing Study_ offers further insight into the various needs among this
unbanked segment. It
[states](http://www.cgap.org/p/site/c/template.rc/1.26.10806/):

> People who use mobile money users are not all alike. One third of mobile
> money users do no remittances at all, bucking the prevailing perception of
> the service. A significant group use mobile money quite intensively: more
> than 4 times per month, with more than half of their transactions going to
> something other than sending/receiving money – e.g. airtime top-up or
> cashless purchases in stores. Surprisingly, 12 percent of low-income mobile
> money users do not own their phone. These represent sub-segments of the
> population worth exploring further.
>
> Operators should explore services beyond remittances and airtime top-up.
> Savings holds particular promise as a highly demanded service. When asked
> what additional services they would be likely to try over mobile money, low-
> income users enthusiastically said savings (65%). One in ten unbanked mobile
> money users is already storing an average of $31 in their mobile wallet, or
> about one-quarter of their household savings.

In their October 2009 paper _“Scenarios for Branchless Banking in 2020”_ ,
Mark Pickens, David Porteous, and Sarah Rotman [indicate the forces that will
shape the future](http://www.cgap.org/p/site/c/template.rc/1.9.40599/ ) of
branchless banking include demographic changes, activist governments, security
concerns, internet browsing capabilities, and the global financial crisis.
According to their report, wiring the electronic retail payment infrastructure
is an important goal, but it is not sufficient on its own to alleviate
poverty.

_Katrin Verclas_ , the co-founder and editor of
[MobileActive.org.](http://mobileactive.org) – a citizen media source that
tracks developments in this area, feels that we still have a long way to go
before moving money on mobiles through m-banking can truly benefit the poorest
of the poor. In a [a blog post from 2008](http://mobileactive.org/mobile-
banking-really-reducing-poverty-close-look-promise-v-reality), she said:

> Mobile financial transactions do reach the poorest of the poor in two areas
> right now: 1. Micro-finance, where mobile financial services are being
> explored as a way to facilitate instant transfer of loans and repayments via
> mobile, and 2. Cash aid (mobile cash payments) by donor countries and
> humanitarian organizations who provide relief in famine or post-conflict
> areas.
>
> The future is indeed bright for moving money on mobiles in many developing
> and middle-income countries but extending the benefits to the poorest of the
> poor are still elusive. Recent studies, most notably from the World Bank’s
> InfoDev and the British development agency DFID, indicate that there is
> little evidence that m-banking services as they exist today have been
> “transformational”…

As far as the future success of the ‘m-banking for the unbanked’ is concerned,
Katrin's observations are as follows:

> In short, questions around consumer adoption and the illdefined and complex
> regulations hinder this market and the potentially transformational idea of
> m-banking to date, requiring thoughtful approaches on both fronts and
> enabling environment where mobile banking can thrive.
