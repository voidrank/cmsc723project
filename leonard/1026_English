Denmark is [offering
immigrants](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1226698/Denmark-
pay-immigrants-12-000-home-wont-assimilate.html?ITO=1490) from “non-Western”
countries 100,000 Danish kroners (US$20,000) if they volunteer to give up
their legal residency and move “home”. This is just one of many creative
initiatives spearheaded by the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party to make
foreigners – and especially Muslims – feel unwelcome in this [small European
country of 5.5 million inhabitants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark).

According to the Danish People's Party, a coalition partner of the two ruling
right-wing parties of the Danish government, paying immigrants to leave
Denmark will [save the state money on social services and
“problems”](http://www.tv2east.dk/artikler/udlaendinge-faar-100000-kr-tage-
hjem) [da] in the long run. “It costs quite a lot to have maladjusted
immigrants in Danish society,” said financial spokesperson of the party,
Kristian Thulesen Dahl. Funds have also been set aside for campaigns by local
authorities who wish to encourage immigrants to leave the country. The
government have not yet calculated how many people can be expected to accept
the offer.

Around [10% of the
population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Demographics) in Denmark are
immigrants _or_ descendants of immigrants including from neighboring
countries, as well as the rest of the world. The primary issue in politics and
the media for the past many years has been the “integration” of Muslim and
other non-western immigrants and the tension arising from a perceived clash of
cultures. Danish politicians have created some of the most stringent
immigration laws in all of Europe, and continue to score high for it in polls.

**How much, to leave the country?**

![facebook page screenshot](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/11/facebook-page-screenshot-300x262.png)In response, [a
sarcastic public Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&ref=search&gid=191919317436)
[da] protesting the law has been set up to collect 100,000 kroners to pay the
leader of the Danish People's Party, Pia Kjærsgård to leave the country.

The group has over 16,000 members, and the tagline says, “100,000 kr. dear
friends – and maybe she'll do it”. The group creators pledge to offer any
additional money collected to the minister of integration, Birthe Rønn
Hornbech from the governing Liberal Party, in case she should be amenable to
leaving the country as well.

The debate on the Facebook group page is heated. Some offer witty comments
about who else should be kicked out of the country or what else should happen
to them, while others counter that the offer from the Danish government is a
generous offer and should be welcomed by immigrants who are unhappy in Denmark
and would prefer to leave. One commenter disagrees with the hype, and reminds
everyone that a similar policy has been in place for several years, but the
amount of money on offer was only 10 times smaller.

Facebook commenter _Dan Cornali Jørgensen_ says [da]:

Have I perhaps misunderstood the concept?  
Isn't it about a law that would give un-integratable foreigners the
opportunity to say yes-please to a check of 100,000 kr. to voluntarily travel
home to their country of origin? It seems magnanimous and absolutely
humanitarian since we must assume that 100,000 kr. is something of a fortune
in that country, and enough to start a decent existence in the country they
apparently have a strong attachment to…

**Pensioners must report travel of more than 2 months**

Another initiative negotiated this month by Danish People's Party is a law
that [requires all pensioners and early retirees in
Denmark](http://www.berlingske.dk/politik/meldepligt-til-alle-pensionister)
[da] to report to their city government if they plan to leave Denmark for more
than two months at a time. Ostensibly, the goal is to stop people “for
instance, Iraqis” from receiving pension payments in Denmark while they may be
collecting wages in another country at the same time. The most popular example
is that of an Iraqi-Danish politician, Samia Aziz Mohammad, who was discovered
to be collecting pension funds while she was earning high wages from the Iraqi
parliament. She has since [paid the money back
](http://politiken.dk/indland/article812531.ece)[da] to the Danish government.
[Another pensioner](http://politiken.dk/indland/article761845.ece) was
discovered by the Danish press to be earning wages from the Kurdish
parliament.

Members of parliament of both the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party
have argued that the new restrictions will also cut down on holiday visits by
fake refugees to their home countries, and repatriation of family members who
spend too much time abroad.

The fact that all Danish pensioners wil in effect will become suspects of
fraud is something the biggest association of the elderly in Denmark, DaneAge,
[is vocally angry](http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/345067:Danmark--
Pensionister-raser-over-ny-meldepligt) [da] about. Many [comments on newspaper
articles](http://debat.bt.dk/index.php?id=1&view=single_thread&cat_uid=3&conf_uid=65&thread_uid=23198&page=1)
[da] support the government's attempt to cut down on fraud, while others draw
comparisons to East Germany (GDR) travel bans of the past.

One Danish blogger, [Erik Bentzen on _Dette og Hint_
,](http://sitestory.dk/wordpress/2009/11/08/pensionisters-meldepligt-er-
chikane-og-tom-signalpolitik/) says [da]:

> Enhver kan sige sig selv, at meldepligten ikke dæmmer op for noget som

Anybody can see, that the new reporting rule isn't going to stop any fraud,
since it does not involve any kind of effective control.
