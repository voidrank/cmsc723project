One of the major ethnic minorities in Central Europe are the
[Gypsy/Roma/Romani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) people. It is
[unclear how many of them live in
Slovakia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_in_Slovakia), because often they
label themselves as ethnic Slovaks or ethnic Hungarians in the polls.

They arrived centuries ago here, and even though this is their home, they're
not fully integrated with the majority. In the Slovak language, for example,
“to gypsy” ( _cigániť_ ) means “to lie.” On the other hand, they are popular
for their dynamic music and, historically, they've been considered excellent
blacksmiths and horse herders.

Traditionally, they've been living in their own communities, some of them as
nomads. They survived [various assimilation
initiatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#Forced_assimilation),
some of which would be deemed unacceptable today. During World War II, from
220,000 to 1,500,000 Romani were [killed by the
Nazis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos).

During the socialist era, nomadic way of life was prohibited, and instead of
their wagons and ghettos, the Roma received new flats. One of Slovakia's
largest and best-known Roma neighborhoods is [Luník 9 in
Košice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lun%C3%ADk_IX).

After the fall of communism, the poorly educated members of the Roma community
became the first victims of unemployment. Unable to pay their bills, some of
them left their flats and created [illegal
colonies](http://images.google.sk/images?hl=sk&safe=off&biw=1279&bih=891&gbv=2&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=romska+osada&aq=f&aqi=g2&aql=&oq=),
with no access to public services, such as electricity, sewage and garbage
collection.

They also grew to rely on social benefits a lot. One of the common majority
stereotypes is that the Roma “have many children because of the related
benefits” – even though a large share of children in foster homes are Roma.

Poverty leads to increase in crime. People living near the Roma colonies are
unable to enjoy fruits of their work in gardens and fields, and even trees in
national parks are being cut illegally. Children and old people are being
robbed, often by the Roma youngsters who cannot be prosecuted. Real estate
located close to Roma neighborhoods is quickly losing value. Some people are
trying to defend themselves. In the village of Ostrovany, for example, [a wall
was erected](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6650958/Anti-Roma-
wall-through-Slovak-village-provokes-outcry.html) between the Roma
neighoborhood and the rest of the village – but it proved useless, because
young thieves were able to get over it.

The media tend to focus a lot more on the problematic members of the minority
than on the ordinary Roma, while some people in the majority population tend
to believe that most of the unpleasant facts about the minorities are
concealed to keep “social harmony.”

Fortunately, along with the state's positive discrimination, various non-
governmental organizations are working with the Roma, visiting them regularly,
teaching them how to deal with money and highlighting the importance of
educating their children. The work done by [Jozef
Červeň](http://cerven.blog.sme.sk/r/5417/Romovia.html) (SLO), a Catholic
priest from Luník 9, is a good example of this kind of effort.

A Roma settlement in Moldava nad Bodvou, East Slovakia. This place, called The
Hole, is outside the city. In the newer part of it, there are newly-built one-
room houses for one family. Some of them are clean, colorful and nice. Others
are dirty and very poor. In the old part, there is one block of dilapidated
flats, as well as many shacks, made of different kinds of materials. Photo by

But life could be hard even for the educated and otherwise “mainstream”
members of the Roma community.

Blogger [Janette Maziniova](http://maziniova.blog.sme.sk/) (SLO) spoke about
her experiences in [an interview](http://www.sme.sk/c/4822268/janette-
maziniova-bratislava-je-k-nam-tolerantnejsia.html) (SLO) with _SME.sk_. Her
problems started in elementary school, when her family moved to a different
city and no one wanted to be friends with her. Even her teacher would reserve
the seat next to her for bad students. As an adult, Maziniova failed to keep
the job of a door-to-door insurance seller – because of the color of her skin.
A waiter at a restaurant once refused to serve her – until she started
speaking French to him.

On the other hand, Silvia Šarköziová, a successful musician, [said she had
only encountered indirect racism](http://zena.sme.sk/c/3527174/silvia-
sarkoziova-zaklad-vsetkeho-je-vo-vychove.html) (SLO). She recalled, for
example, how her daughter had to persuade her friends she was a Gypsy, because
they did not believe someone like her could be one.

According to media reports, the European Network Against Racism
([ENAR](http://www.enar-eu.org/)), is [filing a
complaint](http://www.thedaily.sk/2011/03/21/top-news/enar-files-lawsuit-
against-slovakia-over-racism/) with the European Commission regarding
Slovakia’s failure to remove all forms of racial discrimination. Miroslav
Lacko, head of the Košice branch of ENAR's Slovak branch,
[said](http://www.sme.sk/c/5817495/do-bruselu-ide-staznost-pre-slovensky-
rasizmus.html) (SLO) that “racism in Slovakia has become part of everyday
life” and cited as an example the construction of a new segregated colony for
the Roma, financed by the Slovak government with the knowledge and money of
the EU. “It is concentration camp surrounded by a fence,” Lacko said.

ENAR's initiative has been widely commented on in the Slovak online space.
