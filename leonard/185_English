Singapore’s youth sector will be a significant source of votes in the coming
[General Elections](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/04/singapore-
netizens-discuss-election-issues/). This explains why [political
parties](http://i55.tinypic.com/2202ds.jpg) are also actively campaigning in
the internet. The People's Action Party
([PAP](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/20/singapore-bloggers-criticize-
pap-manifesto/)), which has been in power since 1959, is expected to face
touch competition from several opposition parties. The last general elections
were held in 2006. Below is a google map of [rally
venues](http://maps.google.com.tw/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=zh-

Aaron Koh explains why [‘Foursqaure check
in’](http://socialpr.blogspot.com/2011/04/which-election-rally-in-
singapore.html) is important in election rallies

> The Workers’ Party (WP) saw the most Foursquare check ins at its rally on
> the first day of campaigning. Why is Foursqaure check in important? This is
> because those that check in are definitely smartphone users with mobile data
> connection. This means that they also make use of their smartphone as one of
> their key source of information. With the younger generation expected to be
> the “swing votes” for this year’s elections and with 82 out of 87 seats
> contested, it is important that the political parties planned their online
> strategies to get the message to these voters, even for the next General
> Elections five years down the road. By then, it will no longer be where they
> get the news, the question is how they get the news.

_Yawning Bread_ analyzes how [mainstream
newspapers](http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/print-media-some-
things-change-some-things-stay-the-same/) are covering the election campaign

> …in the present era with the ubiquitous cellphone camera and rapid
> distribution channels that are well beyond blogs, such as twittering and
> Facebook, the old editorial policy is no longer viable. If the newspaper
> does not publish such pictures, others will, and its credibility can only
> suffer. Digital natives tend to dismiss the mainstream media. This is
> misplaced neglect. The days may be over when newspapers can be used to
> blatantly twist stories or allocate coverage to benefit the PAP, but there
> are subtle ways nonetheless to set an agenda favourable to the ruling party.
> That’s why it is still important to have a truly unbiased mainstream media,
> and why it is important to keep an eye on what they do.

_Flaneurose_ uses [census data](http://flaneurose.blogspot.com/2011/04/when-
in-doubt-turn-to-data-generational.html) to determine the importance of the
youth vote

> I am no pundit, and I lack mystical powers that allow me to read the
> sentiment on the ground. What I have however, is census data, and a belief
> that younger folks are more likely to want change, while older folks would
> prefer the status quo. Those Singapore citizens who were aged 40 and above
> back in year 2000 are now aged 50 and above. In every single region, they
> comprise a smaller percentage of that region's population today due to the
> effects of mortality. In contrast, those Singapore citizens who were aged
> 10-19 in year 2000 are now aged 20 – 29 and of eligible voting age. …in most
> geographical regions, they now do constitute a larger percentage of the
> population than in year 2000.

Aaron Ng sees the young generation as
[unpredictable](http://chaptertworeload.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/gen-y-
independent-young-and-unpredictable/) and harder to please

> Gen-Y Singaporeans, however, are a different breed. Politically, they are
> likely to be much harder to please. Gen-Y Singaporeans, by virtue of the
> fact that they are more educated, are more independent-minded and demand
> more from the government than their parents. Economic prosperity is not
> enough, and Gen-Y Singaporeans probably have a very different idea of
> economic prosperity compared to their parents. Socially and politically,
> Gen-Y Singaporeans, unlike their parents, are no longer contented to leaving
> things in the hands of the PAP, which has ruled Singapore since it achieved
> self-government from the British in 1959. Their voices are loud and clear on
> [online platforms](http://asiancorrespondent.com/53241/new-jamiq-swarm-
> chart-visualises-singapore-election-buzz-online/), their natural playground
> as they grew up with the Internet. Gen-Y Singaporeans are probably a lot
> more unpredictable than their parents, and political players need to start
> figuring out what makes the Gen-Y tick, how to connect with them and more
> importantly, how to get their vote because there will be even more of them
> in the next elections.

Ow Shi Hong is concerned about the [political
education](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/04/dealing-with-democracy-from-
young/) of the young

> I wonder if many Singaporean children and teenagers are politically
> uninitiated or ill-informed. More pointedly and plainly, I question if the
> typical Singaporean child and teenager is politically ‘neglected’ and left
> to learn politics informally through conversations, newspapers, blogs and so
> on. I say this because I shudder to imagine some Singaporean primary school
> student’s response – or lack thereof – to the question of “What is
> democracy?”

_The Satay Club_ provides a [rally
roundup](http://satayclub.net/2011/04/rally-roundup-day-one/) during the first
week of campaigning

> The election campaign kicked off in earnest with five parties holding
> rallies. The WP’s Hougang rally drew the biggest crowd, with an estimated
> 60,000 to 70,000 people turning up. Meanwhile, the newly-formed Reform Party
> held its first-ever election rally in West Coast GRC, and attracted a modest
> but respectable crowd that was estimated at being between 5,000 to 8,000.
> The ruling PAP kicked off its campaign at Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC – the
> stronghold of Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, while the NSP and SDP
> held their rallies in Marine Parade GRC and Holland-Bukit Timah GRC
> respectively.

The opposition Workers’ Party gathered the biggest crowd but it does not
guarantee more votes for them. _Singapore Election Watch_
[explains](http://singaporeelection.blogspot.com/2011/04/rally-crowds-doesnt-
translate-into.html) why

> Here's my experience when I went down to the WP rally April 29. I talked to
> folks who were rooting for the WP. But what they said was troubling: Of the
> 6 people, 2 will vote for the PAP, 3 undecided, the last one wanted to spoil
> his vote. Amazing but true.

_In the Beginning was the Logos…_ [reacts](http://logos-
pistis.blogspot.com/2011/04/short-reflection-on-opposition-rally.html) to the
speeches of opposition candidates

> I guess what impressed me the most was the emphasis on providing housing,
> economic and environmental conditions suited for the raising of children. If
> housing and economic costs were too high, and working conditions too long to
> make possible the care and raising of children, then this country is pretty
> much doomed.
