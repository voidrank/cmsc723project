On December 23, 1972, [a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 struck
Managua, Nicaragua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Nicaragua_earthquake)
killing 5,000, injuring 20,000, and leaving 250,000 homeless. Nicaraguan
blogger Homero was a young child at the time, but he holds memories of the
aftermath, which he describes [in a recent post
[es]](http://homeronica.blogspot.com/2009/12/nicaragua-37-anos-del-terremoto-
del-72.html) in his blog _Ventana de Homero [es]_ (Homero's Window).

When we were able to emerge to a patio behind my house, we could see that the
sky was red and that the atmosphere was charged; the neighbors started to
gather, the majority were wearing their sleeping clothes, and some children
were crying because they were scared. My father said to me in a serious tone:
“It is an earthquake, son, Managua has surely been destroyed” and it was true.

The family left in their car to check on the safety of the grandparents, who
lived across the city. Embarking on that trek, they saw much pain in the
darkened streets.

> Por primera vez miraba como en una película lenta y en blanco y negro; como
> la gente deambulaba sin rumbo por las calles; otras desesperadas rascaban
> con su manos los escombros buscando a sus familiares enterrados bajo las
> lozas y bloques de cemento. Pude ver como en unos carretones de madera
> trasladaban muertos y heridos y todo el mundo imploraba; “llevenos al
> hospital” y nosotros no podíamos hacer nada.

For the first time, I saw things in slow-motion and like a black and white
movie; how the people aimlessly wandered through the streets; others were
desperately digging the rubble with their hands, looking for buried family
members under the cement blocks. I could see how some wooden carts moved the
dead and wounded and everyone pleaded, “take us to the hospital” and yet, we
could not do anything.

Neighbors organized themselves to provide water and blankets to those who
needed it, as well as organized search teams to look for the dead and injured.
Homero also noted that there was not a single member of the national guard on
the streets, which only added to the chaos:

> Los ladrones aprovecharon la madrugada para asaltar las tiendas y robar lo
> que encontraban; al principio no sabía, miré un hombre sucio y sin camisa
> cargando un televisor por las calles y mi padre me dijo: Ahí va un ladrón.
> ¿Y como lo sabes? le pregunté, por que nadie en estas situaciones se
> preocupa salvar un televisor. Eso solo era el comienzo de la ratería que se
> desató en los días posteriores; mientras los ladronzuelos de los barrrios
> hacían su “diciembre” Somoza y sus secuaces se robaban la ayuda humanitaria
> de los danmificados del terremoto de Managua.

The thieves took advantage of the daybreak to rob stores and steal what they
found; at the beginning I didn't know what was going on, I saw a dirty and
shirtless man carrying a television through the streets and my father said to
me: There goes a thief. How do you know? I asked him, and he said because no
one in this situation is worrying about saving a television. It was only the
start of the pilfering that was unleashed in the following days; while the
neighborhood thieves did their “December” (Christmas), [former president
Anastasio] Somoza and his henchmen stole the humanitarian aid for those
affected by the Managua earthquake.

He ends his post with a reflection on the legacy left by the earthquake 37
years ago:

> Nicaragua no solo había perdido miles de sus hijos; también perdió su
> capital, la novia del Xolotlán y ningún gobierno le ha podido devolver su
> centro ni su belleza.

Nicaragua not only lost thousands of its sons; but it also lost its capital,
the bride of Xolotlán and no government has been able to return neither its
city center, nor its beauty.
