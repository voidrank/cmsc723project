“In wine is truth”, said the ancients. It is true that alcohol in limited
quantities helps loosen one's inhibitions but in Japan it is often used as a
social lubricant in a society that still sees a necessary [ gap between one's
real feelings and intention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae) (
_honne_ ) and what one says on social occasions ( _tatemae_ ).

Drinking with classmates or team mates when you are a student, or with
colleagues when you are an employee is an important activity if you want to be
part of the group. According to many, it is with a glass of beer or sake in
hand that a new type of franker communication may occur, or a _nommunication_.

_Nommunication_ (roughly translated as _drinkommunication_ ) is a term created
by mixing the verb _nomu_ (to drink) and the term ‘communication’. It can be
defined as an important part of becoming a [social
person](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/08/japan-call-us-social-beings-
now/) [en], as it deals with the working etiquette of an employee, and was
created to indicate the type of communication that is established between a
superior with his junior colleagues over social drinks apart from the office.

A night of drinking. By jamesjustin CC License.

The [summary of an anonymous short
essay](http://otdr.hp.infoseek.co.jp/essays/031214nomi.htm) [ja] titled
“General Observations on Salarymen” (サラリーマンに関する一般的考察) explains the origin of
the concept.

> そもそも、ノミュニケーションというのが出来たのは、高度経済成長時代に、会社運営を円滑に行うために思考錯誤された結果であると考えられる。  
>
> というのも、上司というのは一般的に部下を叱責する義務がある。端的に言えば、部下というのは怒られるために存在しているようなものである。かと言って、誰でも怒られて嬉しいわけではない。  
>
> そこで、部下の様子を見て上司は一杯連れていってやるわけである。まぁ、通常は居酒屋あたりに連れていって、恐縮している部下に向かってビールを注ぎながら、「一杯飲めや」となるわけである。で、部下は「いただきます」と言いながらビールを飲みつつ、会社の愚痴を言ったり、私生活の悩みなどを相談するわけである。

Initially, the term of _nommunication_ was created during the high economic
growth era, as the result of trying different methods to strengthen a
corporate mentality that would serve to make a company run more smoothly.  
Put simply, bosses generally have the obligation to rebuke their subordinates.
And frankly, it could be said that subordinates exist to be scolded. But of
course, nobody is happy at being scolded.  
So, considering the feeling of their subordinates, the superiors would invite
them to have a drink. Usually they would take them to an
[izakaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya) (restaurant and bar) and
provide beer to their uneasy subordinates. They would cheer them up with a
“hey, here it is. Let's drink!”. The subordinate would then thank and while
drinking beer, he would air his complaints of their company and problems in
his private life.

Alcohol is, in some cases, a businessman's best friend as it is over a glass
of [shochu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dch%C5%AB) [en] that the best
negotiations happen. As with many other cultures, inviting clients to dinner
is a common habit in the Japanese working culture, and the so called _settai_
, often translated as ‘business entertainment’, is as important as the
meetings that the company executives may have with their clients in the
company offices.

_Yellowbel_ [confesses ](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/yellowbell/20100703) that while
he would often refuse to drink with his colleagues when he was a simple
employee, he cannot avoid wining and dining with his clients now that he runs
his own company.

> その後サラリーマンを辞めて、小さいながら会社を切りまわし始めると、お酒の席は断るとか断らないとかじゃない、生活の一部になってきました。  
>  営業系の自営業にとって、酒の席で本能に限りなく近いところでおつきあいするのが、商売というかオフィシャルな自分を売り込むのに一番いい手段になるからです。

Since I quit my job as an employee and started up my own business, it has not
just become a matter of drinking or not; alcohol has simply become a part of
my daily life.  
For a self employed person who is also a sales manager, drinking with a client
until you're relating with each other as your true selves is the best tool in
which to “sell” yourself.

  
If _nommunication_ is a powerful tool in the hands of a salesman, it is
sometimes the cause of pressure and stress for those junior employees who feel
obliged to accept their superiors’ invitation. Male employees are more exposed
to this kind of pressure as they are expected to be heavy drinkers.

A [recent discussion on Twitter ](http://longwindedness.blog45.fc2.com/blog-
entry-1774.html) [ja] brought to light this deep-rooted stereotype as Twitter
user [@shisetsu](http://twitter.com/shisetu) commented that he finds it
unpleasant that it is taken for granted that everybody must drink alcohol.  
@shisetsu's few tweets sparked a debate on the habit of after-hours partying
where colleagues often gather to drink alcohol at an _izakaya_ as a way to
relief stress but sometimes to foster the relations among the team.

While some other Twitter users agreed with him saying that sometimes they feel
they obliged to drink as every one else does,
[@akcanon](http://twitter.com/akcanon) responded saying that drinking alcohol
is part of a social duty for an adult.

> @shisetu
> 飲めない事をただ強調するんじゃなくてキチンと理由まで説明すべきだと思うな。学生じゃなくて社会人だし、職場のコミュニケーションて大切なことだよ。
> お金貰ってるから仕事だけしてればいいってもんじゃないよ。

@shisetu I think that if you don't drink, you must not simply say so but you
must explain the reasons thoroughly. You are not a student anymore but an
adult and being able to communicate is important in the working place. You are
not getting paid only to do your work and that's it.

The [swift reply by @shisetsu](http://twitter.com/akcanon/status/17415399237)
[ja] changed the tone of the conversation and later on made @akcanon apologize
and reflect over the idea that being a working person is equal to being an
alcohol drinker.

> @akcanon
> 私は体質上の飲酒は全く問題ありませんが、私の父はアル中かつDVなので子供である僕と弟は反面教師で全く飲みません。これを飲み会で言って場の空気を悪くするのも酒飲みが望むご都合主義のコミュニュケーションでしょうか？人間関係を大事にするのと飲酒に因果関係はありません。

@akcanon I don't have any health reasons as to why I can’t drink alcohol but
my dad was an alcoholic and this resulted in domestic violence to my brother
and I when we were children. So as a reaction to this, I don't drink at all.
Explaining all this at a dinner and making the mood strained … would this be
the kind of atmosphere and communication that those who drink wish? There is
no cause and effect relationship between valuing other people and drinking
alcohol.

Working environments have been changing in the last years, mainly because of
the economic crisis and the system is collapsing. Some believe also that some
social obligations like _nomunication_ are becoming less pressing and fewer
and fewer younger businessmen feel it as duty to step their career up.

Blogger _kikuiri_ , for example, [believes
](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kikuiri/20090511/1241974980)that the reasons may also
be that people are busier and busier nowadays, many use their cars to go to
work and plus … the priorities are changing.

> 「忙しい」には、もう１種類あって、「家族の世話」で忙しいというケースがあります。  
>  それこそ１０年くらい前までは、勤めている人＝飲みニュケーションに参加する人＝家庭の仕事に追われていない（放棄？）男性
> という図式がほぼ成り立っていたと思うのですが、今現在、その図式は成立しないと言ってもいいでしょう。  
>  実際、「育児」に関わる人は、飲みニュケーションには少なくとも数年間は参加できないと思いますし、これから増えると思うのは「介護」に関わる人であります。

Among the category of the ‘busy people’ there is the case of those who are
busy because “they have a family to take care of”.  
Until 10 years ago there was the equation: employee = person who takes part in
the _nommunication_ = man who takes no part in (or rejects) the household
chores. Nowadays however, that equation is no longer applicable.  
As a matter of fact, those who are committed in child-rearing won't be able to
take part to the _nomunication_ for a number of years at least and also the
number of people committed to nursing the elderly will increase.

Salarymen. By A Malchik! CC License

Probably to avoid the social pressure that drinking with acquaintances may
cause, more and more people have also been [ choosing to have their drinking
parties online ](http://www.suntory.co.jp/rtd/horoyoi/horo-yoi/) in convenient
virtual meeting places provided by major brewers, or in drinking chat
sessions.  
Possible side benefits include no need for make up for the women and probably
no heavy drinking for the men.
