policymakers search for high-tech ways to fight climate change, a proposed
low-tech solution is creating controversy — contraception.

Bloggers around the world are writing about climate change today, October 15,
as part of [Blog Action Day](http://www.blogactionday.org/). One less obvious
potential solution to climate change is related to the availability of
contraceptives and reproductive health services. Many studies in the past few
months have examined the relationship between population growth and climate
change, some in support and others against using family planning as a method
of emissions reduction and to minimize the impact of climate change. EJ,
blogging on _New Society Publishers_ in Canada,
[elaborates](http://newsociety.com/blogs/index.php/2009/10/05/impacts-of-
population-growth-entering-th):

> “This issue of who lives and who dies, who can have more children and who
> should have less children, is also beginning to raise its head in the
> climate change movement…
>
> …Global population is a serious consideration for the future of our
> ecosystem. We have been debating this issue since at least 1972 when the
> Club of Rome published Limits to Growth, and yet solutions continue to evade

The world's population is
[expected](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf
) to reach more than 9 billion people by 2050, with 95 percent of this growth
in developing countries. Those in support of investing in reproductive health
services and contraception to combat climate change argue that having fewer
children means less carbon emissions and less strain on diminishing natural
resources.

An
[editorial](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(09\)61643-3/fulltext?_eventId=login)
in the medical journal Lancet last month called attention to the links between
rapid population growth and increased vulnerability to the consequences of
climate change, such as food and water scarcity and environmental degradation.
It suggested that by reducing unintended pregnancies, we could slow the high
rates of population growth and possibly ease pressure on the environment. The
Lancet says that over 200 million women want, but currently lack, access to
modern contraceptives, resulting in 76 million unintended pregnancies every
year.

An economic case was made for investing in reproductive health by a recent
[study](http://www.optimumpopulation.org/releases/opt.release09Sep09.htm) from
the London School of Economics (LSE) and commissioned by the UK-based Optimum
Population Trust. It showed that contraception is almost five times cheaper
than leading green technologies, such as wind and solar power and hybrid or
electric cars, to combat climate change. Specifically, the study found that
each $7 (£4) spent on basic family planning over the next four decades would
reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by more than a ton, but it would cost a
minimum of $32 (£19) to achieve the same result with low-carbon technologies.

Matthew Yglesias, blogging on _Yglesias_ in the United States,
[supports](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/09/population-and-
climate-change.php) the study's finding:

> “The evidence is pretty clear that in societies where women are empowered
> and have access to contraception, that on average they want modest-sized
> families. And what this study is talking about is specifically what could be
> accomplished by closing the gap between the level of contraception that
> people want to have and the level of contraception they’re actually able to
> maintain. There are dozens of good reasons to think closing that gap would
> be beneficial, the impact on the environment is one of them.”

Still, Ann, blogging on _Feministing_ in the United States, remains wary of
the study's recommendations,
[saying](http://www.feministing.com/archives/017929.html):

> “The LSE report contains a prominent caveat that this is about non-coercive
> family planning, but using fears about climate change as a way to expand
> contraceptive use is eerily reminiscent of ‘population control’ policies,
> some of which were coercive and all of which were rooted in the idea that
> certain people should be having fewer babies…
>
> …We all understand that empowering women to determine their own reproductive
> fates leads to other benefits — economic, societal, and yes, environmental.
> But given the history of population policy, to me the only acceptable
> international family planning policy is one that is motivated by increasing
> the empowerment and choices for women. Full stop.”

_[The New Security
Beat](http://newsecuritybeat.blogspot.com/2009/09/combating-climate-change-
with-condoms.html) _says that countries such as India are objecting to
bringing population into the climate change debate without more focus on
reducing consumption in developed countries. A recent
[study](http://www.iied.org/human-settlements/media/study-shatters-myth-
population-growth-major-driver-climate-change) supports this assertion.
Published in the journal Environment and Urbanization, it shows there is at
most a weak link between population growth and rising emissions of greenhouse
gases. The study's researchers say the real issue is not the growth in the
number of people, but the growth in the number of consumers and their
consumption levels.

Simeon, a reader of Malawi's NyasaTimes
[commented](http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/study-shatters-myth-that-
population-growth-is-a-major-driver-of-climate-change.html) on the study:

> “The West needs to learn to live simply if we are ever going to cut these
> green house emissions. This may sound like moralising, after all Africans
> envy the western lifestyle and see it as a model of prosperity and
> happiness. We waste time connecting population growth climate change. I am
> happy that the study has finally exposed the lie behind this long held
> fallacy. President Yoweri Museveni recently at the United Nations asked a
> very tough question: ‘If the whole world were to have access to the western
> lifestyle, would the planet be able to support us?’ I see that in the years
> to come the concept of development needs to be seriously reviewed and
> changed. Maybe to develop may mean living healthily and not necessary having
> everything”

Ruth Limkin, a pastor blogging from Australia, [says](
http://ruthlimkin.blogspot.com/2009/10/humans-not-enemy-in-climate-
change.html) maybe we should take a different approach altogether, where
people are the solution and not the problem:

> “What if we invested in innovation and respected reproduction?
>
> The inherent potential in humanity itself is stunning if ever appreciated in
> its breadth and depth. The genesis of a truly great, revolutionary idea for
> energy generation, for agricultural technology, for waste reduction or for
> recycling methods may lie in the person you met yesterday.
>
> Or it may lie in the fourth child of a family in Africa or India. What if,
> instead of controlling population, we created opportunities for education,
> established cultures of creativity and encouraged responsible, careful use
> of the natural resources around us?”
