After more than a year's worth of work, two Colombian companies have finished
a short animated film and wish to share it with the world through a free
online premiere.

Victeria and Globuleo is the retelling of Romeo and Juliet in 3D animation,
and it makes their odds even harder since Victeria is a flu virus and Globuleo
is a white blood cell: a most impossible love story would be hard to come by.
[Los Filmes Videocreation](http://www.losfilmes.com/) and [Vectorial Animation
Studios](http://www.vectorialanimationstudios.com/), both companies located in
Cali, Colombia and a team of [additional Colombian
talent](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=88619125283): animators,
scriptwriters, singers, artists and producers came together to make this short
movie happen and it is being released online for free today, December 4th.

Following is the [trailer for the short](http://vimeo.com/7293979):  

The short has been promoted through microblogging tool Twitter and you can

On [Julian Eduardo Albornoz's blog at El País of Cali newspaper
website](http://elpais.com.co/blogs/principal/blog1.php?b=52&n=1968), he wrote
about the short:
