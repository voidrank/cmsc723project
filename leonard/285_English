On the[ 2nd of March](http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/02/minorities-minister-
attacked-in-islamabad.html), an unknown gunmen shot and killed Pakistan's
Federal Minister For Minorities [Shahbaz
Bhatti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Bhatti). His body was riddled
with bullets, as his assassins flew the crime scene leaving behind a pamphlet
stating his death was justified. This is the second high-profile killing after
the assassination of [Governor Salman
Taseer](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/13/pakistan-salmaan-taseer-we-
buried-a-man-not-his-courage/). Bhatti was the only christian member of the
cabinet and his death is a huge setback not only for minorities but also for
the entire nation. Upon hearing the news of his assassination Pakistanis on
twitter reacted with horror and grief. On
[Gawaahi.com](http://gawaahi.com/2011/03/02/stand-up-in-peace/) I wrote about
the initial reactions and urged people to stand up against the violence.

> “ _There is no hope for Pakistan”_
>
> _“RIP Pakistan”_
>
> _“The Country has gone to the dogs”_
>
> _Rest in peace Pakistan. It was the first message I read on my twitter feed
> this afternoon. It didn’t take much time to scroll down, and read the tragic
> news. Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan’s minority minister and the only Christian
> member of the cabinet, had been shot dead. Shock, horror, fear — it’s
> difficult to pinpoint what came first._

_Kalsoom Lakhani_ at _CHUP_ described his death as _[an immense tragedy,
another nail in the coffin for those willing to be truly courageous in this
country](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/another-islamabad-
assassination/). __Ahsan Butt_
[expressed](http://asiancorrespondent.com/49508/the-shahbaz-bhatti-
assassination-what-if-weve-already-crossed-the-crossroads/) his hopelessness
over the assassination that left many Pakistani's pessimistic about the
future.

> failure kind of way; I’m sure the state will continue to survive for a long

Both Taseer and Bhatti were assassinated for their stance on the blasphemy
law. Although reactions after Bhatti's death are fairly different than
Taseer–no widespread celebrations. A post on Cafe Pyala
[points](http://cafepyala.blogspot.com/2011/03/graveyard-for-lunatics.html) at
the widespread culture of justifying murders in the name of religion.

> _I take personal issue with every man, woman or adolescent who says ‘but’
> when debating whether dissension merits death._

_Mosharraf Zaidi_[asks](http://www.mosharrafzaidi.com/2011/03/08/honouring-
bhatti’s-memory/) Paksitanis to shed their political differences and unite in
grief to honor the memory of Bhatti. _Yasir Lateef Hamdani_ on Pakteahouse
describes Pakistan after Bhatti at _[ideological
crossroads](http://pakteahouse.net/2011/03/14/at-ideological-crossroads/)._
Amid all the gloom and despair, two remarkable women _Naveen Naqvi_ and _Beena
Sarwar_ spoke of courage and resilience.

On her blog _Naveen Naqvi_ wrote a poignant account of Bhatti's death titled
_[Your silence can mean more murders](http://naveenaqvi.com/2011/03/09/your-
silence-can-mean-more-murders/)_ :

> _Please step up with me. Do not think it will not make a difference. It
> will. There are precedents for it, and we must have the will to set new
> precedents, or let me reiterate — there will be nothing left for us to
> fight.I ask you to step up with me on March 12. Join the_[ _letter
> campaign_](http://citizensfordemocracy.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/open-letter-
> to-the-president-prime-minister-interior-minister-chief-justice-and-heads-
> of-all-political-parties-pakistan/) _to the Government and Judiciary against
> religious intolerance on Saturday, March 12 from 11am to 7pm. I hope to see
> you then._

In addition, _Naqvi_ also attended and posted
[pictures](http://gawaahi.com/2011/03/11/shahbaz-bhatti-memorial-in-karachi/)
of Shahbaz Bhatti's memorial in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi. Human rights
activist, Beena Sarwar published her e-mail correspondence with Gwynne Dyer,
dismantling the perception that there is a [deathly
silence](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/pakistan-not-quite-a-
deathly-silence/) after the assassinations. The letter writing campaign, Naqvi
spoke of in her blog, gathered over [15,000
people](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/phenomenal-response-to-
the-cfd-mass-letter-campaign/) from different walks of life. [Video
](http://gawaahi.com/2011/03/13/your-silence-means-more-blood-cfd-letter-
campaign/) shot by Sabeen Mehmud, from the event shows people showing up in
great numbers.

Despite the over-whelming response many have criticized and [raised
questions](http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/4884/citizens-of-hypocrisy-can-a-
petition-save-pakistan/) on whether petition could help solve Pakistan's
problem. On my own [blog](http://sanasaleem.com/2011/03/17/say-no-to-
intimation/) I tried to reason with this growing pessimism:

> _Criticism is inevitable. In this case, it is the question of a petition
> being the solution to our arduous problems. It’s true, a petition is not the
> only solution. It is, however, an initiation point for a much bigger action
> plan. These 15,000 people defied all labels and cliches. It was not about
> the liberals or the conservatives, but about Pakistanis uniting against
> violence and fear. It is symbolic of the fact that, contrary to popular
> perception, we are not a nation of vigilantes. The atmosphere of
> intimidation can only be countered by courage._
