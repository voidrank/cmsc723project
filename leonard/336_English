One of the more distressing sub-plots in the ongoing two-week uprising against
[Colonel Muammar Al
Gaddafi](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Muammar_al-Gaddafi) in
Libya has been reports of the Libyan leader's alleged use of “African
mercenaries” to prop up his falling regime.

Global Voices has covered
[stories](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/24/serbia-reactions-to-the-
story-of-serbian-mercenaries-in-libya/) of mercenaries from Serbia bombing
civilians from airplanes. But the majority of speculation regarding
mercenaries portrays them as “foreign” or “African” — meaning from Sub-Sahara
Africa and “Black”. This storyline is echoed everywhere in [international
media](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/22/gaddafi-mercenary-force-
libya), in [Arabic
media](http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/19/138351.html), and in
online citizen media and
[videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uGr2AHRxs&feature=related&skipcontrinter=1).

Why put a Black face on the mercenary story when people in Libya are both
[light and dark skinned](http://www.afrol.com/articles/37443)?

In an open letter to Al Jazeera posted on the blog _Sky, Soil & Everything In
Between_, KonWomyn [worries](http://konwomyn.blogspot.com/2011/02/about-those-
african-mercenaries-al.html) that the broadcaster's shorthand description
simply has become [“mercenaries from
Africa”](http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/02/2011222165119717549.html),
instead of looking deeper into who these people actually are, and that this
description is being copied in media around the world.

Fear is another reason these claims are widely perpetuated. In a comment on a
blog post on Arabist.net about mercenaries in Libya, “Benedict”
[writes](http://www.arabist.net/blog/2011/2/24/qaddaffi-paying-a-fortune-for-
soldiers-of-fortune.html#comments):

Nonetheless, captured mercenaries in Libya have so far included people with
identification papers from [Tunisia, Nigeria and Guinea
(Conakry)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8349414/African-
mercenaries-in-Libya-nervously-await-their-fate.html) and
[Chad](http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=33135&Cat=1&dt=2/26/2011).
In [Ghana](http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php
ID=203647&comment=0#com) there are rumours that people in Accra had been
offered as much as US$ 2,500 to fight for Gaddafi. And in
[Ethiopia](http://ecadforum.com/ethiopian-news/6118) local people have
reportedly also been hired to fight. Here is a video of an alleged mercenary
captured by locals in AL Barqa, Libya.
