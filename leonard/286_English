[The earthquake in
Japan](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/) has become a tragedy for the entire world. This is evident from
the willingness of people from different countries and continents to help the
victims of the quake, which took the lives of thousands of people.

Bulgarians want to give shelter to the Japanese victims of the earthquake

[A Facebook group created by
Bulgarians](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_196310323723249) willing
to help those affected by the quake has been active in the past few days. It
was started by a few people, but grew to over 900 members in a very short
time.

Varsenia Stoyanova, a member of that group, wrote a message, proposing
concrete ways to help by offering shelter to Japanese families:

Message to group members

> All those who can help, please post a message, explaining what kind of

> disaster – a room, a house, an apartment, a resort, a hotel, etc. This way
> we can create a list, which will be given to Mrs. [Kristalina

> Japanese embassy.

> Because the initiative aims at making clear that Bulgarians are willing to

There are over 50 comments under this post, discussing the issue of housing
and clarifying how ordinary Bulgarians would be able to help.

Nina Karakasheva:

> As I said before, the Japanese people have financial resources. The
> Bulgarian government should simply designate the places, the land where
> temporary constructions, trailers, mobile homes would be placed in order to
> shelter the people from Japan.  
>  This problem should be resolved by the Bulgarian government, not by
> Bulgarian families. Currently, a quick, mass distribution of land for
> temporary housing is needed. These are people who need land, they have
> everything else a thousand times over, compared to the average Bulgarian
> families.

Varsenia Stoyanova:

> Nina, we are the change. The politicians won't do it on their own. As for
> the group, the suggestions, etc., I think we should underline the severe
> crisis situation in Japan at the moment, so our intentions are made clear.
> Yes, we're still in the beginning, but at least we're making it clear that
> there are people who are willing to help.

Siyana Ignatova:

> We can offer a house (for 6 people) in the Vodolei village in Veliko Tarnovo
> region, as well as an apartment for two in a holiday resort near Balchik [a
> Bulgarian Black Sea resort].

Sania Koprindzhiyska:

> I can offer a house in the city of Alfatar, Silistra region [a Northern
> Bulgarian city]. It has a yard, a large garden and garage. The house is
> equipped with every necessity, it's big, in very good condition and able to
> house a large family.

Vladimir Todorov:

> Dear friends, let's show our readiness to help those in need, without any
> selfishness, because our cause is noble and human. God help them and us!!!

Varsenia Stoyanova:

> So far, 43 Bulgarians have offered shelter to over 200 Japanese people
> without compensation!!
