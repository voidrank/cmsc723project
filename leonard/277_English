A group of international artists realized paintings and drawings dedicated to
the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The works are part of an
open project called [Tsunami, Des Images pour le
Japon](http://cfsl.net/tsunami/?paged=9). You can send your original
illustrations [ here](http://cfsl.net/tsunami/?page_id=2) [fr].
