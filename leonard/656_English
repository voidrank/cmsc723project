In the Philippine countryside, majority of peasants still suffer from ages-old
feudal and usurious practices and rural underdevelopment as reflected in the
lack of mechanization in the agricultural sector and deteriorated farm-to-
market roads.

Last month, some Filipino bloggers joined a commercial tour to the mountainous
parts of Cebu City in relation to the “Kumprahan Supermerkado,” a project by
local business groups that aims to bridge the gap between peasants in the
countryside and their affluent market in the city.

Aside from simply promoting and providing additional media projection to this
project, the bloggers also got a small glimpse on the livelihood of the
peasants of Sitio Cantipla, Tuanan, Cebu City. _Crossroads_ , for instance, is
[fascinated](http://markg87.net/kumprahan-sa-merkado-farm-tour-at-cantipla/)
by the thought of organic farming.

Meeting with local vegetable farmers in Cantipla, Vernon Go

And _The Photoblogger_ [comments](http://www.focalglass.com/cantipla-sudlon-

production.

After braving the dilapidated and winding roads to the area, Maria Eleanor
Valeros of _The Freeman_ found out that peasant leaders themselves shared [the
same sentiment](http://pbspvro.blogspot.com/2010/07/day-at-farm.html).

Even after more than half a century of formal independence, the Philippines
remain a backward and agricultural country whose industrial enclaves as well
as communication and transportation infrastructure are largely the result of
foreign capital investment that are geared towards serving foreign demand
rather than national needs.

Efforts like “Kumprahan Supermerkado” can surely help improve the lives of
selected peasant communities. But the resolution of [the issue of genuine
agrarian reform and rural development](http://www.bulatlat.com/main/luisita/)
on a systemic and nationwide scale remains to be one of the longstanding
aspirations of the Filipino people.
