The border row between Thailand and Cambodia has
[intensified](http://khmerweekly.com/2011/02/07/cambodia-complaints-to-un-
amid-new-clashes-with-thailand/) in the past week as both countries exchanged
[fires](http://ki-media.blogspot.com/2011/02/photos-from-
border.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot/bmaW+\(KI+Media\))
killing several soldiers on both fronts and forcing the evacuation of nearby
villages near the border. The two Southeast Asian nations are claiming
ownership of the historic [Preah Vihear
Temple](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/20/cambodia-thailand-preah-
vihear-dispute-continues/).

[Tharum Bun](http://asiancorrespondent.com/47958/comments-from-cambodia-on-

Here’s one from [Albeiro Rodas](http://cambodia1.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/the-
danger-of-nationalisms/)

> As Khmer is oldest in the Indochina Peninsula than Thailand, at least as a
> political state, it is like Cambodia is Greece and Thailand is Italy.
> Cambodia is first and it is impossible to deny it. Thailand has been built
> over the Cambodian territory, history and culture. It does not mean that
> Thailand is not authentic or it is an invader, but Thai people should
> recognize it not in humilitation, but in brotherly afection.
>
> Cambodia comes from suffering and got a strong spirit. The Thai leaders
> should wake to lucidity, suspend any agression and sit down with their Khmer
> brothers, as they are, to build peace and common development for their
> peoples.

_Khon Kaen_ criticizes [tourism officials](http://www.khonkaen.ws/tourism-
authority-of-thailand-and-the-thai-cambodian-border-clash) in Thailand who
seem to be not a bit worried about the impact of the border fighting on the
tourism industry

Many readers believe that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN
should have done something to mediate and settle the issue. This was
illustrated by _Sacrava_ through a [cartoon
sketch](http://sacrava.blogspot.com/2011/02/sacravatoons-no-1926-asean.html)
that he posted on his website

_The Son of the Khmer Empire_ accuses Thailand’s Prime Minister [Abhisit
Vejjajiva](http://sokheounpang.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/a-cheap-politician-
the-reason-why-abhishit-doesn%C2%B4t-want-multiparty-intervention-and-need-

> This border war between Cambodia and Thailand has nothing to do with

> selfish and nationalism elite persons esp. the Democrats and its alliance.
> This war is motivated because Abhishit hopes:

> against Cambodia.  
>  – to unite Thai people to continue to support his weak government and win
> the next election in April as he has already made an appeal to Thai people

The same blogger also accuses Cambodian Prime Minister [Hun
Sen](http://sokheounpang.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/the-reason-why-hoon-xen-
doesn%C2%B4t-want-third-party-intervention/) of manipulating the issue to
strengthen his leadership

> \- His popularity may gain  
>  – People will forget about their economic hardship caused by his
> incompetent leadership,  
>  – He will have the reason to buy more weapon and ask for more money for his
> personal soldiers,  
>  – He hope to gain more vote and cling on to power for years to come.
