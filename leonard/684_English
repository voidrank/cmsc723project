[Borneo Colours](http://www.borneocolours.com/) is a website that links
bloggers from Brunei, Sabah, Sarawak, Labuan (Malaysia) and Kalimantan
(Indonesia) which are all located in the island of Borneo. It's a platform for
the bloggers in this region to network and create greater understanding about
their neighbours.

To date, Borneo Colours or BC has over 1,000 members with almost 200
registered bloggers and the number is said to increase daily. Speaking to the
CEO and founder of the site, [Daniel
Doughty](http://corporate.borneocolours.com/) shared with this author the
history of the website.

The idea came about during the early part of 2002. The aim was to facilitate
and encourage Borneans to show goodwill to the world. Later, the founder
realized the huge financial challenge in maintaining the project called
“Borneo”. Eventually in 2007, BC was quietly launched but sadly the idea was
momentarily put aside as the founder was offered to assist an international
NGO in initiating a marine conservation project. It was in early 2009 that the
founder decided to bring the idea back to life. Around July 2009, armed with
fresh funding and support, Team BorneoColours.com began their work by
promoting their ideas to the Borneo Island Community and tourism bodies in
Sabah, Sarawak, Labuan, Brunei and Kalimantan. BC had its soft launching on
25th September 2009 but it was only last January when it became operational.

_What are your aspirations for Borneo Colours?_

> To be the official new media and community portal endorsed and recognized by
> governments within Borneo island, but most importantly by the Bornean and
> international online community. Our goal is also to shape

> transparent sustainable financing to raise funds for local charity
> organization, community development and environmental awareness activity on
> the island.

_What can one get from reading/being a member of Borneo Colours?_

_You got a Blogging Competition going on at Borneo Colours? What do you aim to
achieve from that competition?_

> Borneo Bloggers Award 2010 was designed to give prominent and upcoming

> appreciate each other's differences but most of all to create a sense of
> Borneo without borders. We are also hopeful that this program will help
