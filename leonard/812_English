Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Google
[honoured](http://www.rsf.org/Iranian-women-s-rights-activists.html) the
online journalists of the women's rights website _[we-change](http://www.we-
change.org/)_ on 12 March with the first “Netizen Prize”, a new annual award
for those who defend freedom of expression online. RSF's report on[ “Internet
Enemies”](http://www.rsf.org/ennemis.html) was released on the same day.

[Parvin Ardalan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvin_Ardalan) from _we-change_
accepted the award at Google's Paris offices. The Iranian women's movement has
always shown resistance… Now the movement is bringing its experience and
methods of working democratically into cyberspace.

The we-change website has been a supporter of a virtual campaign called[ One
Million Signatures Demanding Changes to Discriminatory Laws](http://www.we-
change.org/english/spip.php?article18). The campaign calls for putting an end
to discrimination against women in Iranian law. It is a follow-up to the
peaceful protest of the same aim, which took place on 12 June, 2006 in Haft-e
Tir Square in Tehran.

Here is a video film where we-change introduces its aims and history:

Parvin Ardalan[ also won an Olaf Palme Prize
](http://payvand.com/news/08/feb/1130.html)in 2007, but the Iranian government
did not permit her to leave country to accept it in person. She recorded this
message on You Tube.

Meanwhile several Iranian bloggers including [Shiva
Nazarahari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Nazar_Ahari), a female blogger
and human rights activist, have been jailed since the 12 June presidential
election.
