"Why did they kill Yuri Volkov?" (a campaign banner, by Teh_nomad

The murder of a TV journalist and football fan Yuri Volkov in the centre of
Moscow on July 10, 2010, became a widely discussed event in the Russian
blogosphere. A complicated topic, dealing with hostile ethnic stereotypes,
crime, police corruption and Russian subcultures, has generated nearly 7,000
comments, tweets and blog posts. Two mass street actions were held, gathering
from 1,000 to 3,000 people mourning the victim and asking one question: “Why
did they kill Yuri Volkov?”

The murder took place near Chistie Prudy metro station at 1 AM on July 10,
2010. According [to the
version](http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2010/076/04.html) [RUS] of Volkov's
friends, a company of 9 friends were on their way back home when one of the
offenders pushed one of them and provoked a quarrel. The fight was immediate
and short. As a result, Volkov received deadly knife wounds and died. Three
offenders – Akhmedpasha Aidayev, Bekhan Ibragimov and Magomed Suleimanov –
were detained by the police within several minutes after the fight. The
witnesses of the fight recognized them, the police found the knife as well as
blood on the offenders’ clothes. The official police version with its Soviet
propaganda style [mindlessly said](http://www.petrovka-38.org/news/1617) [RUS]
that it was just a drunken quarrel. It was not.

Volkov was an active fan of the [“Spartak” football
team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Spartak_Moscow) [EN]. Football fans, and
especially “Spartak” fans, are known for their excessive
[violence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIBlJ9wmXtc) [RUS] and
[xenophobia](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3047420.stm) [EN]. LJ user
_yermoloff_
[described](http://livejournal.com/474757.html?thread=5003397#t5003397) [RUS]
them this way:

> из всех клубов … именно спартаковских болельщиков провожают до метро. именно
> их держат в тройном оцеплении ментов. именно они мне, идущему в пиджаке с
> экзамена, разбивают лицо.

of all the football club fans, it's only “Spartak” fans who are being
accompanied to the metro [by their peers – GV]. It's only them who are guarded
by three circles of the police [during football matches]. It's them who
smashed me in my face when I was coming back from an exam, dressed in a suit.

LJ user _d2om_ , however,
[argued](http://d2om.livejournal.com/40723.html?thread=427283) [RUS] that Yuri
had been “a responsible and adequate fan.”

At the same time, football fans have a strong feeling of group solidarity and
have vast online networks, some of which are hidden from the search engines.
It was through the Internet fan forums that a few thousand people were
mobilized to come to the streets in order to pay tribute to Volkov. The first
and the second commemorations were well documented by bloggers (pictures and
videos available [here](http://evgen-valyaev.livejournal.com/15837.html)
[RUS], [here](http://drugoi.livejournal.com/3301828.html) [RUS] and
[here](http://bb-mos.livejournal.com/271127.html) [RUS]).

The organizers of the commemoration [were very
strict](http://supul.livejournal.com/352975.html) [RUS] about forbidding any
political agenda of the action. The conventional media tried to call it a
“meeting of the skinheads” (a common label given to football fans), although
the pictures prove it's not quite true. “Skinheads” [did indeed join the
commemoration](http://pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/pic/010a0kf3.jpg), but were
not a significant part of it. The violent crime in the centre of Moscow
touched both ultra-nationalists and people not interested in politics at all.

An important detail about the offenders – who are all of the
[Chechen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_people) [EN] origin – put the
topic into the framework of complex ethnic relations in Russia, and,
specifically, the [Russian-Chechen
relations](http://carnegie.ru/events/?fa=2980) [EN]. LJ user _varfolomeev_
[wrote](http://varfolomeev.livejournal.com/354938.html):

> Если бы убийцами этого несчастного 23-летнего мальчика оказались не чеченцы,
> а представители какого-либо иного народа, шума и общественного возмущения
> было бы столько же? И также бы собирались сотни людей, чтобы почтить память

Would it be less of a stir and public outrage if the murderers of the 23-year-
old boy weren't Chechens but representatives of some other nation? And would
hundreds of people gather in order to mourn the victim, would they make flash
mobs, and would popular bloggers write about the emergence of civil society if
the murderers were the same Muscovites as Volkov?

Nationalist and neo-Nazi groups of bloggers were happy to join (and,
eventually, lead) the discussion of the case, stressing the nationality of the
offenders. During the mass commemoration actions, graffiti featuring
xenophobic slogans (“Chechens are killing Russians,” “War in your home,” “A
Russian killed by the Chechens”, “Moscow is a territory of war”) appeared on
the walls of the nearby houses.

A lot of popular bloggers couldn't stay neutral in this story and followed the
nationalistic discourse of the story. As LJ user _voland-bride_
[wrote](http://voland-bride.livejournal.com/159440.html):

> Много топовых блоггеров среагировали на смерть Юры Волкова, много написали о

A lot of top bloggers reacted to Yura Volkov's death, wrote a lot about how
it's hard to be a defenseless Muscovite, but no one made any effort to dig
deeper into this case – because it's not that simple. In general, the death of
a football fan by a knife of the “immigrants” is a thing that demands a
serious journalistic investigation, but not guesses with admixture of
chauvinism.  
The propaganda machine of the nationalists had been launched, and where
there's a machine, it's well-known that there's little truth.

Another aspect of the story – the corruption in the Russian police – was
raised because two of the three offenders had been released from jail
(allegedly due to a bribe given to the police). Some bloggers
[believed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdZ0J2G6lDE) [RUS] such a mild
measure had been chosen because of the pressure of the Chechen diaspora
representatives on the investigation.

Evgeny Valyayev, press secretary of “[ _Russkiy
Obraz_](http://community.livejournal.com/rus_obraz/)” (“The Russian Image”)
ultra-right nationalist organization, [posted](http://evgen-
valyaev.livejournal.com/16312.html) [RUS] a screenshot from the
_[Islam.ru](http://umma.islam.ru/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=12683&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0)_
[forum](http://umma.islam.ru/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=12683&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0),
where an alleged sister of one of the offenders was trying to gather money for
a bribe (250,000 roubles, or $8,200), to “free” her brother from the police
(the identity of the author hasn't been verified).

Blogger _stroev_sergey_ commented on both the corruption and nationalist
trends of the discussion:

> …ЛЮБАЯ диаспора может откупить, отмазать своего члена. Кроме русских. У
> которых нет диаспоры. Потому что русские всегда жили в симбиозе со своим
> государством и если это государство оказалось антирусским, то русские
> оказались людьми второго сорта, за которых НИКТО, НИКОГДА не заступится.

…ANY diaspora can buy out and protect its member. Except Russians. Who don't
have a diaspora. Because Russians have always lived in a symbiosis with their
government, and when the government turned out to be anti-Russian, Russians
became second-class people, for whom NO ONE, NEVER will stand up.

Yuri's girlfriend (her name isn't disclosed) [started](http://for-
him14-07.livejournal.com/) [RUS] a LiveJournal blog, in fear that the police
will soft-pedal the issue due to the pressure from the “diaspora” and the
alleged bribes. Popular blogger _teh_nomad_ [started](http://teh-
nomad.livejournal.com/396322.html) a silent flashmob offering people to repost
the black picture with a question “Why did they kill Yura Volkov?” The same
slogan [appeared](http://www.sovsport.ru/news/text-item/398217) [RUS] during
several football matches.

Yuri's girlfriend wrote:

I'm sitting here, writing this, but I'm scared. I'm scared because I'm a girl.
I'm scared because at the place of the tragedy some strange people came, made
pictures, and disappeared.  
I'm scared because if something happens to me, **everything will be just stuck
with RIPs on the guest boards.**

In the whole case the most underrepresented point of view was of ethnic
Chechens. Ramzan Kadyrov, president of the Chechen Republic,
[posted](http://ya-kadyrov.livejournal.com/4693.html) [RUS] a generic post on
the unacceptability of labeling whole nations for the crimes of individuals.
Timur Aliev, Kadyrov's adviser, made an attempt to understand the incident:

A friend of mine, a couple of years ago, told me that it was impossible to
live in Moscow without a knife. Without it, it's very easy to become a victim
of [gopnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopnik)s [aggressive young males]. On
one night, he was attacked by four. They wanted either to beat him, or to rob
him. He took out his knife and rushed towards them. They fled.  
[…]  
Why am I writing it?  
I'm not a wrestler, not am I a boxer or a karate fighter. And, personally, I
wouldn't want to be an object of a beating. This is, first of all, degrading.
Probably, I would do my best not to become such an object.

The case of the murder of Yuri Volkov isn't the only one in the long list of
the numerous ethnic crimes committed both by Russians and non-Russians in
Moscow. It provoked, however, one of the most active reactions among
Muscovites during the last couple of years. Among other things, it has
highlighted a total lack of trust towards police and legal procedures of
justice (with the evidence of two out of the three offenders having been
released soon after the incident), and a high level of police corruption
combined with the reluctance of the mainstream media to cover such a sensitive
topic. The case has highlighted the mobilizing power of the football fans’
online networks and the ease of embedding nationalistic narratives into such
dramatic events.
