Let’s start with Singaporean students in Tokyo who wrote about their
experience when a [strong
earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/) struck Japan last week. [Tang Chee
Seng](http://enquirer.sg/2011/03/18/dont-give-in-to-groundless-fear/) used the
bathroom to store emergency supplies

> At first, I felt slightly dizzy, a feeling that I knew was part of an
> earthquake.
>
> It seemed minor at first, until my shelves and dishes began to rattle
> violently.
>
> Remembering some half-truth I’ve heard about certain bathrooms in newer
> Japanese buildings as being earthquake-proof, I quickly moved to the toilet
> and sat down, waiting for the shaking to stop.
>
> My friends and I stocked up on canned goods, water and emergency supplies,
> based on the hypothetical situation that we would be trapped under rubble. I
> set out my supplies into a backpack, along with my thickest waterproof
> jacket and clothes laid out on the limited rack and floor space in my toilet

[Cassandra Eng](http://enquirer.sg/2011/03/13/living-with-aftershocks/), also
a student in Japan, recalled how she was unable to differentiate between the
tremor and herself shaking from fear

> I’ve moved and kept everything heavy and dangerous from my shelves. I’ve
> packed an emergency bag and stocked up on food. I only dare to lie in bed
> when I know I am going to give in to exhaustion. I sleep in clothes that I’m
> ready to run out in. My running shoes are unlaced and placed at the head of
> my bed next to my emergency bag. I have 4 litres of boiled water in my room
> and a tub filled with water should the supply be cut. I eat anything and
> everything that doesn’t require cooking. I don’t want to watch the news but
> I have to, so I keep it running. I bathe with the news on maximum volume so
> that I can hear the earthquake alert siren if there is any. I can no longer
> differentiate between an after tremor and myself just shaking and it scares
> me because I don’t know when to panic.
>
> I am tired of living in fear.

She observed how everybody was helping each other in Japan

> And yet, I have never loved this country more. Japan has impressed me even
> more in time of disaster and I cannot respect her people and her
> preparedness more.
>
> Companies and restaurants are giving out free food and drinks, schools are
> opened as shelters, free calls, free wireless, free lodging at hotels, and
> more. People are scared and are all in a rush to go home or make a call, but
> there’s still order. There is a definitely an increase in demand for food,
> but there is no rush. Already, money has been raised for those affected by
> the quake. And the fact that this country has continually aimed for
> earthquake-proof buildings has saved the lives of so many.

[Ng E-Jay](http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=6298) reacts to the statement of
Singapore Senior Minister Goh who compared the ‘noise’ made by Singaporeans
about the [flooding disaster](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/08/the-
great-floods-of-singapore/) which hit the city state last year and the ‘stoic’
response of the Japanese today

> It would have been great if SM Goh has commented only on the fortitude of
> the Japanese. But he turned this tragedy around and used it to accuse
> Singaporeans of complaining about relatively minor events like our recent
> floods. He said Singaporeans were noise makers.
>
> This is reprehensible.
>
> Japan as a nation will be stronger as a result of dealing with this crisis.
> But the People’s Action Party (PAP) will not be stronger as a result of
> their ineptitude at managing Singapore’s flood control system, which has
> failed spectacularly, repeatedly, and inexcusably.

Media giant Channel News Asia was forced to
[apologize](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2011/03/mediacorp-says-sorry-for-cna-
japan-earthquake-email.html) for sending this [marketing
email](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2011/03/japan-got-earthquake-quickly-book-
your-cna-commercial-slots-now.html) only hours after the earthquake in Japan

[Lucky Tan](http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2011/03/during-crisis-who-stays-
who-leaves.html) praised the Fukushima nuclear plant workers and volunteers
who remained to repair the damage in the plant. He asked if Singaporeans would
do the same thing if a similar disaster hit the country

> If a situation like Fukushima surfaces in Singapore and volunteers are asked
> to be part of a mission to save others by risking their lives, how many will
> volunteer? The situation is different from a war and you're asked to be part
> of an army….this one is a suicide mission where your health and very likely
> your life has to be sacrificed away with a high level of certainty.

_Spotlight on Singapore_ believes the government should convince neighboring
[Indonesia](http://rogerpoh.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/nuclear-accidents-oppose-
indonesia-nuclear-energy-plans/) to drop its plan to build a nuclear plant

> Singapore should vigorously oppose the construction of nuclear plants in
> Indonesia.
>
> The [annual haze](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/22/haze-envelops-
> singapore/) that plagues Singapore, thanks to Indonesia, is child’s play
> compared to a radioactive cloud.

_The Enquirer_ is hopeful that
[unity](http://enquirer.sg/2011/03/16/can-%E2%80%9Cnoisy%E2%80%9D-singaporeans-
take-a-real-tsunami/) can still be achieved in Singapore even if natural
disasters are rarely occurring in the country

> Do Singaporeans need a national disaster on the scale of Japan’s earthquake
> and tsunami to coalesce a sense of national solidarity? Are we spoilt in the
> absence of natural calamities?
>
> While immensely tragic and painful, external threats and disasters had this
> unintended effect of uniting a society, as history has shown.
>
> While disasters bring out the best in everyone, a sense of national spirit
> and belonging can still flourish in a safe and stable Singapore. A key to
> achieving this is an inclusive society where feedback and criticism are
> respected, not a top-down leadership which dismisses all comments as
> “noise”.

[Singapore Red Cross](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/03/if-you-want-to-help-
the-japanese-earthquake-survivors/) continues to receive donations and other
forms of assistance that will be given to Japan earthquake survivors.
