On September 18, a man was writing on the walls of the [Balderas Metro
Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Balderas) in Mexico City, when he
was confronted by a police officer. The man reacted and began shooting,
killing the officer. During the chaos, subway riders sought refuge in the
subway cars, while others fled up the stairs looking for an exit. Another man,
identified as Esteban Robles Barrera, decided to take matters into his own
hands to prevent more deaths and charged at the gunman. His intervention was
unsuccessful and he, too, was shot and killed.

The security video of the entire incident soon appeared on Mexican television
and on the internet showing the sequence of events in graphic details. Some,
like Bernardo Degaray [thinks that the video should not have been shown
[es]](http://twitter.com/bdgaray/statuses/4110210535) because of what it
depicted.

The images clearly show the actions of the police officer and of Robles
Barrera, as well as their tragic deaths. On sites like Twitter, there has been
an [outpouring of admiration for the bravery

men. Roberto Marmolejo (@AdrianusImp)

Seeing the video from the Balderas Metro (Station) shows you that there are
still heroes in splendidly miserable Mexico City.

Other Mexican bloggers describe where they were during the tragic event.

The blogger at _Historias y Reflexions del Albuelo [es]_ (Stories and
Reflections from Grandfather) [also provides a recap of the
day](http://albuelo.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/balacera-en-el-metro-balderas/):

I was on my way home, in the bus that takes me to the cyber-café where I
connect to the Internet, when, out of laziness, I asked for the driver for his
cellular phone and I connected to Twitter to say goodbye to my grandchildren
and the guys, when I started to receive information about the event.

At first, I thought it was a joke, just like the crazy person and the
“hijacking” of the Aeroméxico plane. Nevertheless, when I started to receive
more and more information, I knew that the matter was very delicate.

Between what the news sources and the comments being shared by reporters and
friends, I realized that it was a serious matter and especially because of the
concern that came over my friend Morf0, who knew that a friend used the same
(subway) route to get to where she was going and he could not get in touch
with her.

The reference to the [failed hijacking of the Mexican flight involves a
Bolivian
priest](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hurKrE3xb7Gfc6iwUeTYJy5slHOgD9ANH7T80),
who attempted to divert the plane indicating he had a bomb. No one was hurt
and he was taken into custody.
