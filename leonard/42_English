Kurdish people are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, making up 20 per cent
of the population, which is close to 20 million people. They have been subject
to state-sanctioned discrimination and human rights violations. Today, in
Yuksekova, which is a district in the Hakkari province of Turkey, Kurdish
people were attacked for gathering to celebrate Newroz – the Kurdish new year.

One Kurdish politician, Ahmed Turk was hospitalised, and 32-year-old Alaattin
Okan was hit with a tear-gas canister in Batman. Two prominent Kurdish
websites were taken down earlier this morning, and have been unable to send
updates regarding the clashes. In addition to this, mainstream news sites have
been slow in covering this story, which is why Kurdish activists have used
social networking sites to raise awareness.

[Bianet](http://www.bianet.org/yazar/faruk-arhan) tweeted a picture showing a
Kurdish woman being attacked by Turkish riot police:

Another Kurdish activist, [tweeted this picture](www.twitter.com/@quzzulqurt),
showing Turkish riot police firing tear-gas and Kurdish youth responding with
stones out of anger and frustration that they can't even celebrate the Kurdish
new year without being attacked:

Hawri Tofik from Sweden was among the hundreds of Kurdish activists angered by
the Turkish government's brutality towards Kurds celebrating Newroz. She
