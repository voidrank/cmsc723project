Will a cash incentive make women want to have a child? Going by recent figures
under Singapore’s recent Baby Bonus initiative, a government plan to raise
declining birth rates in the country, the answer ostensibly is “no”.

According to [news
reports](http://www.malaysiainsider.com/index.php/world/35226-baby-bonus-
little-impact-in-singapore-hasn't%20worked), S$230 million (about US$162.3
million) in baby bonuses were handed out by the Singaporean government in
2008, yet there appears to be no corresponding rise in the number of
Singaporean babies born.

The [Singapore government's
website](https://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/index.html) explains:

> You will get a cash gift of up to $4,000 each for your 1st and 2nd child and
> $6,000 each for your 3rd and 4th child. All your children born on or after
> 17 August 2008 will also enjoy Government contributions in the form of a
> dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings you contribute to your
> child’s Children Development Account (CDA). If your child is born before 17
> August 2008, he or she will enjoy the Government matching contributions in
> the CDA if he or she is your second to fourth child.
>
> The CDA is a special savings account that you open at any OCBC Bank or
> Standard Chartered Bank branch for your child who is eligible for CDA. You
> can save in the CDA any time until 31 December in the year your child turns
> 6 years of age. The savings will be matched up to the cap of $6,000 each for
> the 1st and 2nd child, $12,000 each for the 3rd and 4th child and $18,000
> each for the fifth and subsequent child. The Government will match your
> savings in the following month.

This means that the those eligible will not only get the cash bonus, but [also
moneys from the government in the CDA account](http://iantan.org/?p=1445),
subject to a cap, depending on the birth order of the child.

Recently, Singapore’s National Population Secretariat
[statistics](http://www.malaysiainsider.com/index.php/world/35226-baby-bonus-
little-impact-in-singapore-hasn't%20worked) revealed there were only 32,423
citizens born last year, just 129 more than in 2003, the year before the
government extended the Baby Bonus Scheme to include the first and fourth
child.

According to _[Mother of Six](http://fohl.blogspot.com/2006/06/six-kids-and-
they-are-real-bonus.html)_ , a blogger in Singapore who writes on motherhood
and social issues, the perception of having a larger family in Singapore is
not favourable. She says:

> Often, when I tell people I have six children, they react in disbelief. Many
> must think we are crazy, as the norm in Singapore is to have just one or
> two. Now with the baby bonus, three or four children may become a standard
> in future. But six?
>
> The typical objections to having so many children in Singapore are mainly
> economical. Rising costs is one. If you factor in tuition, enrichment,
> supplementary class, school buses, childcare, day care and maid, then there
> will be disincentives to have more than two children.

On the other hand, single unwed mothers in Singapore [do not
enjoy](http://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/faq.html) the baby bonus
benefits. According to [the _Association of Single Mothers Singapore
blog_](http://afsms.blogspot.com/2007/09/being-mother-is-noble-status-right-
so.html):

> By providing single mothers a chance to move out and start a family on their
> own, they learn to be independent and self-help themselves.
>
> By providing single mothers with the same privileges like the ability to
> purchase HDB flats (government housing) and receive the Baby Bonus, they can
> stop worrying about facing pressures when at home and focus better at work
> and improving themselves. By having a clearer mind and more refreshed and
> energized self, they can better plan their future.
>
> The Baby Bonus allows single mothers to pay for their child’s basic needs
> like milk and diapers. Single mothers can also use that money to enrol their
> child into public nurseries so that they have more time on their hands to
> take on a more permanent and stable job. With bonuses, single mothers can
> ease their minds

[Molly’s blog](http://mollymeek.livejournal.com/144749.html), _To Fix A
Mocking Peasant_ , a personal blog, has an interesting analysis into the
situation of the stance of the Singapore government and single unwed mothers:

> As usual, our darling [CNA (Channel News
> Asia)](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/262796/1/.html)
> is able to sum up the hopelessly impressively circular (il)logic of the
> government's representatives in one succinct sentence (perhaps without
> seeing the irony?):
>
> “The baby bonus will not be extended to single unwed mothers as the Marriage
> and Parenthood Package is an incentive for married couples.”
>
> In other words, we won't extend the baby bonus to single unwed mothers
> because we won't. The Baby Bonus will remain something for married couples
> because we won't extend it.

Molly writes further:

> Other wonderful reasons Mrs. Yu-Foo (Minister of State for Community
> Development, Youth and Sports) came up with for not extending the Baby Bonus
> to single unwed mothers include the fact that they are eligible for other
> sorts of benefits that married mothers are eligible…
>
> Single unwed mothers are not entitled to the Baby Bonus because they are
> entitled to everything else. Yes, that's to sum it up in one line.
>
> But you have yet to see the best of Mrs Yu-Foo:
>
> “The Marriage and Parenthood Package is not a financial assistance scheme
> for children. The government
>
> cannot and should not be the surrogate father.”
>
> So, the Baby Bonus is supposed to lighten the financial costs of having
> children, but it's not a financial assistance scheme! The government can
> give the Baby Bonus to poor married couples without becoming the surrogate
> father, but if it extends the Bonus to single unwed mothers, it will become
> a surrogate father!

She ends her commentary by saying:

> Single unwed mothers, often more so than married mothers, make a conscious
> decision to keep their babies instead of aborting them due to the social
> stigmas associated with being, well, single unwed mothers…
>
> Sons of single parents serve NS (Singapore’s compulsory National Service)

_Pretty Princess Maggie_ , “a mum who is committed to her family and her
handsome baby boy”, has interesting perspective of motherhood and Singapore’s
baby bonus [on her
blog](http://prettyprincessmaggie.blogspot.com/2008/10/more-babies-for-
singapore.html):

> The Singapore government had recently revised its baby bonus package.

The background of Singapore’s current predicament of an aging population is
interestingly explored on _[Singapore Sojourn
blog](http://singaporesojourn.blogspot.com/2009/08/breed-breed-breed.html)_.
It states:

> …If one reads the history of social engineering from the 1960's onwards it
> becomes apparent the reluctance to breed was first triggered by a deliberate
> campaign to reduce population.
>
> In those times parents who had more than two children were penalised and the
> incidence of abortion was high. Having a third child carried a stigma and
> financial cost.
>
> Mui Teng Yap wrote an interesting paper on this subject entitled Fertility
> and Population Policy: the Singapore Experience in which he wrote “
> _Singapore has long been known for its use of social policies to influence
> fertility/reproductive behaviour. This began in the late 1960s/early 1970s
> and continues to the present, although the demographic objective has changed
> from anti-natalist to selectively pro-natalist._ ”

> There was also great concerned that ‘educated’ Singaporeans were not

A few reasons why Singapore’s baby bonus has not produced its desired results
are laid out in [(13)
Expositions](http://2009ri3b13.blogspot.com/2009/08/does-baby-bonus-truly-
equate-to-bonus.html). Among the reasons listed, are the society’s mindset and
the difficulty in maintaining a good work-life balance:

> Firstly, there is a higher need in the change of the society’s mindset. As
> Singapore modernizes, its citizens become more educated and women are able
> to become more independent. They develop a deep passion for their career and
> a sense of satisfaction when they succeed. In fact, Singapore has witnessed
> a sharp increase in the percentage of working mothers from 45.6% in 1986 to
> 54.3% in 2006…
>
> Secondly, the difficulties in maintaining a balance between work and family
> cause couples to be hesitant to have babies. Working women are especially
> reluctant to have babies, fearing the insurmountable task of having to
> juggle between the demands from work to their family-building duties, which
> require large amounts of commitment…
>
> In conclusion, other prominent factors have been shown to affect the
> decision to have children. Thus, the Baby Bonus Scheme is limited in its
> impact and presents a too simplistic solution to resolve such a personal and
> complicated dilemma.

The _[Temasek Review](http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/08/20/high-cost-of-
hdb-flats-a-key-reason-for-failure-of-baby-bonus-to-boost-birth-rate/)_ also
adds that the high cost of living, especially housing, is a prime reason for
the ineffectiveness of the baby bonus.

According to a [news
report](http://www.malaysiainsider.com/index.php/world/35226-baby-bonus-
little-impact-in-singapore-hasn't%20worked), Sociologist Paulin Straughan has
suggested that a cash incentive is not enough to encourage women to take on
the role of motherhood. She was reported to have said that what mothers and
parents really need is more “flexibility and latitude” at the workplace. She
was [quoted](http://www.malaysiainsider.com/index.php/world/35226-baby-bonus-
little-impact-in-singapore-hasn't%20worked) as saying, “We need more
enlightened employers who know that granting parents time off for pressing
childcare needs may actually produce happier, more productive and loyal
workers.”

_[Mother of Six](http://fohl.blogspot.com/2006/06/six-kids-and-they-are-real-
bonus.html)_ concludes:

> What lessons can be drawn from my experience? Firstly, making a decision to
> have a child is a personal one between a husband and his wife. We have
> children because we like children, even if we do not get to enjoy a baby
> bonus. It would be sad if a couple had a child solely for the monetary
> rewards, as a child needs more than money to grow into adulthood.
>
> Secondly, women need to rediscover who they are. Only we can bring life into
> the world, and since the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s, I feel we have
> actively suppressed this important role of procreation. Of course, in this
> era of equality, we can argue that the husband must also contribute to
> bringing up a child — but if a woman does not even allow herself to bear a
> child, how can the man get the chance?
>
> Often, women in Singapore prefer a briefcase to a bottle, a notebook to a
> nappy. In this drive to actualise ourselves as career women and useful
> citizens, have we forgotten that we have the power and ability to bring life
