Presidential [elections in Uruguay
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/14/uruguay-election-season-
underway/)were held on Sunday, October 25, and no one can say who will become
the next President because no candidate received the required majority (50% +
1). In this situation, the election will go to the next round in a run-off
election on November 29, 2009.

The Broad Front candidate, Senator [José
Mujica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mujica), was the closest to the
majority needed receiving 48.16% of the votes. In second place, the National
Party candidate [Luis A.
Lacalle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alberto_Lacalle), received 28.9% of
the vote, still giving him a chance to win and who will face Mujica in the
run-off election. In third place, the Colored Party received 16.66% of the
vote, considered to be an internal victory for its followers. This party had
fallen in past elections, after being the governing party for many years. Now,
under the leadership of Pedro Bordaberry, the son of ex-dictator Juan M.
Bordaberry, the party has grown more than expected as indicated in earlier
surveys.

The 4th political party, the Independent Party, did not achieve the necessary
percentage to obtain a Senate seat, receiving only 2.47% of the vote. It did,
however, manage to elect two deputies to Parliament.

The reactions from the various parties were surprising, as noted by the blog
_Asi Ta'l Mundo Botija [es]_ , who makes references to the contradictions.
[The party that celebrated the most was the one that received the least number
of votes, and on the contrary, those who received the highest percentage
appeared to be sad](http://www.asitalmundobotija.com.uy/2009/10/26/uruguay-un-
pais-politicamente-raro/):

Many took (the results) as a surprise or as a victory, and it was not, in my
understanding, “not one or the other.” At least for me, it was not a surprise.
There were those who thought (or dreamed) that the Broad Front would win in
the first round. I don't think those people should be sad. On the other hand,
the National Party received less than the 30% predicted by the surveys;
nevertheless, the celebration by many of their followers were as if they had
won the World cup. The Colored Party also celebrated a lot. They came in third
place after the vote tally, that is how this country is.

He also provides some thoughts on why the Broad Front did not win outright in
the first round:

Well, even though I may make some readers angry, I think one of the reasons
was that the ticket should have been the other way around. In other words,
(Danilo) Astori for President and Mujica for Vice-President. I admire Mujica.
He says things in a straightforward manner, he is not politically correct, he
is not that much of a hypocrite or a person that fails, which are things we
are accustomed to around here. But … the people elected him over Astori, even
though (Astori) is the person who knows the most about the economy in this
country, recognized by the opposition. This would have been enough to attract
people from other political sectors.

However, another blogger known as La Ciudadana (The Citizen) wrote in her blog
_Qué pasa Uruguay? [es]_ that the Broad Front [should think about what went
wrong](http://laciudadana.blogspot.com/2009/10/mi-opinon-sobre-las-
elecciones.html):

The Broad Front, however, should self-criticize itself, it should think a
little bit about where they went wrong, because they had 60% approval rates of
the (current President Tabaré Vásquez from the Broad Front party) President
(something I doubt and will doubt), they had all of the propaganda apparatus
of the government that up until a day before the elections, had been
contributing its support, they had a lot of money for advertising, with the
Cabinet also campaigning, in the end, they had an important apparatus for its
benefit, but all the same, they did not reach the necessary number of votes,
it was a dark day, one might say, because apparently they did not reach
parliamentarian majorities, which is not yet confirmed, they did not win in
the referenda, and they did not win in the first round, which was the primary
goal.

In Parliament, there was suspense from the public whether any party would
obtain the majority of the seats. The Broad Front Party will have 16 seats in
the Senate, while the National Party and Colored Party gained 9 seats and 5
seats, respectively. In the Chamber of Deputies, there will be 50
representatives from the Broad Front Party, 30 National Party members, 17
Colored Party members, and 2 from the Independent Party.

The blog _Mujeres y Elecciones 2009 en Uruguay [es]_ (Women and Elections 2009
in Uruguay) has been providing coverage about issues affecting Uruguayan women
throughout the campaign, and [notes that 6 women Senators had been elected
from the Broad Front
party](http://mujeresyelecciones2009.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/senadoras/).

The [strategies for the next round
[es]](http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/10/27/elmundo/i-02027513.htm) has
already started. According to surveys, it is expected that the Broad Front
Party will continue to govern the country and that Mujica will win the run-off
election. The Colored Party candidate, Bordaberry, [has already said publicly
that he will support Lacalle [es]](http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-
ecuador/alianza-opositora-puede-dificultar-el-triunfo-de-mujica-en-la-segunda-
vuelta-374974.html). The blog _Visión Universitaria [es]_ alludes to this
union of the Colorado and National Parties, [calling them the “Rosados” (the
Pinks)](http://visionuniversitaria.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/2162/). However,
even with this support, it does not appear that the National Party candidate
will have enough votes to beat Mujica.
