Tourism is a big industry in Thailand. In fact, it contributes more than [12
percent](http://www.bangkokpost.com/tourismreview2007/10.html) to Thailand’s
GDP. However, the tourism sector has been severely affected by [political
instability](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/thailand-
protests-2008/) in recent years. The [airport
blockade](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/29/sleepless-and-stranded-in-
thailand/) by anti-government protesters last December damaged the
international reputation of Thailand as a tourist destination.

In the past months, numerous news stories exposing the [different
scams](http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/Tourism-Scams-t299353.html) experienced
by tourists in Thailand further eroded the image of Thailand. Last September,
the TV documentary entitled [“Big Trouble in
Thailand”](http://www.bravo.co.uk/shows/big-trouble-in-thailand/) aired on a
British television channel. This show, which featured the bad behavior of
foreign tourists and locals in Thailand, generated a heated debate in the
cyberspace.

Here is the description of the show from the Bravo channel website:

> Bravo’s cameras go beyond the idyllic beaches and tropical island life to
> capture a rare and fascinating insight into British holidaymakers as they
> party in paradise and discover the horrors that can happen when things go
> drastically wrong.
>
> From adrenaline fuelled drug busts, organised tourist scams, scorned lady-
> boys, violent brothel disputes, bar room brawls, brutal murders, street
> robberies and sexual assaults, the series is filmed in the popular tourist
> hotspots of Koh Samui, Phuket, Bangkok, Pattaya and Chang Mai.

_Oneditorial_ , a Thai citizen, [sees nothing
wrong](http://oneditorial.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/my-perspective-as-a-thai-
on-the-programme/) with the program

> Personally, I see nothing wrong with the programme. Given the title of the
> programme it is guaranteed to feature scenes depicting the bad behaviour of
> some tourists and locals. To my surprise, many people have been making a big
> fuss about it.

Johnny is not happy that it portrays Thailand in a [negative
way](http://oneditorial.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/my-perspective-as-a-thai-on-
the-programme/#comment-445):

> The problem with this clearly that it paints Thailand in a less than
> flattering picture. Sure Thailand as corruption, drinking, sleaze, drugs and
> other nasties shown but there is more to Thailand than this.
>
> Another issue is the alleged staging of events to over dramatise the series.
> If it is true, as evidence suggests, then this makes the documentary all the
> more worse for fabricating events, one of which involved a Pattaya-based
> gangster.

Monsicha Hoonsuwan, another Thai citizen, does not want the international
community to view Thailand as a [“gangster”
country](http://oneditorial.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/my-perspective-as-a-thai-
on-the-programme/#comment-461)

_Bangkok Diaries_ [uploads the
episodes](http://www.bangkokdiaries.com/2009/09/10/big-trouble-tourist-
thailand/) of the documentary. The blogger agrees that the issues tackled by
the show are indeed genuine but doubts if they are often experienced by
tourists:

> On one level it does seem somewhat sensationalized which is to be expected
> of anything you watch on television but on another level this stuff does
> happen. The jetski rental guys are crooks. Dumb ass tourists take drugs in
> Thailand despite the ample warnings everywhere. Idiot drunks get themselves
> in trouble and get the crap kicked out of them by locals. So on that level,
> all of this stuff happens. The big question is whether it happens as
> frequently as portrayed in the program.

_Thailand, Land of Smiles_ thinks the documentary is a
[fraud](http://thailandlandofsmiles.com/2009/09/08/big-trouble-in-thailand/)
and that some scenes were staged

> I think Big Trouble in Thailand is much more than a waste of time…I feel
> it’s a fraud meant to paint Thailand in a negative light. The journalism was
> so one sided and leaned towards sympathetic to all of the British nationals
> involved. I truly believe that parts of this documentary were staged.

The controversial documentary has caught the attention of Thai authorities.
Some are angry over it while [some promised to act on the tourist
scams](http://thailandlandofsmiles.com/2009/09/12/fallout-from-big-trouble-in-
thailand-documentary/) featured in the show

> One good thing that has come of this is that Thai authorities seem to be
> cracking down on the jet ski operators and the scams they perpetrate on the
> tourist community

_Leosia_ [criticizes the reactions](http://leosia.com/2009/09/16/big-trouble-
video-nasties/) of the Thai police to the airing of the documentary

> This is a fairly typical response from the police. Whenever there is a
> problem, it must have been “staged” or someone is being “vindictive” or
> there is a plot against national security. Lots of bland statements repeated
> ad nauseum.
>
> The Police LT is of course speaking from experience, but he’s making the
> mistake of thinking that foreigners have the same motivations as the Thai
> police force. That is, the staging of cover-ups, falsifications and filming
> video evidence of the suspect “pointing” at the scene of the crime.
