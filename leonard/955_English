> In Singapore, raping your wife is not treated as rape.
>
> But it should be.

This is the main message of the [‘No To Rape’](http://www.NoToRape.com/Blog)
campaign published in the [Facebook
page](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25846462465) of the group. The
organizers aim to abolish the marital rape immunity law in Singapore.

> The ‘No To Rape’ campaign advocates one simple idea: sexual violence by any
> person, against any person, is criminal violence. Consequently, non-
> consensual sexual penetration, regardless of whether the victim and
> perpetrator are married to each other, should be treated as rape

The group has already gathered more than [3,000
signatures](http://www.notorape.com/blog/2009/12/01/petition-closed/) for the
petition which will be delivered to the Prime Minister

> We would like to thank everyone who has given his or her support to the No
> To Rape petition to abolish marital rape immunity in Singapore. Twenty
> minutes ago, our petition has officially come to a close with over 3,600
> signatures.
>
> Over the next few days, we will be putting together the data collected
> before presenting it to our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, by email and
> in hard copy.

_Barnyard Chorus_ observes that “[Rape
culture](http://barnyardchorus.blogspot.com/2009/11/public-announcement-
service-no-to-rape.html) in Singapore is a phenomenon that has really caught
us by surprise and disturbed us when it finally reared its unabashedly ugly,
misogynistic andabhorrent head.”

_Syinc_ is [supportive](http://www.syinc.org/the-seachange-
blog/2009/10/13/the-notorape-crew-wong-pei-chi-jolene-tan-and-mark-wong.html)
of the ‘No to Rape’ campaign

> Let's just look at one facet of how maddeningly awful this is.
>
> When a strange man rapes a stranger, it's highly unlikely that they'll ever
> have to face each otehr again.
>
> When a husband rapes a wife, they'll be seeing each other everyday. In fact,
> the abuse is more than likely to keep going on. Perhaps, everyday.
>
> When someone who promised to love and protect you through thick and thin
> commits such a horrific act – this leaves indelible scars deep within a
> person's psyche.

_The Temasek Review_
[explains](http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/24/please-support-no-to-rape-
campaign/) why the cause involves everyone

> This campaign brings together women and men, the young and the old, people
> from different races, believers in various faiths and those of no faith at
> all. Whatever your background, all of us have a shared interest in this.
> Everyone deserves the protection of the law from violence, no matter who
> commits it. Rape is a beating, a form of abuse, that just happens to be
> carried out using a sexual organ instead of a fist.

The ‘No To Rape’ campaign has produced several ads urging Singaporeans to
support the petition drive

Bu some netizens are not supportive of the campaign. Toolang
[comments](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/10/petition-against-marital-rape-
off-to-slow-start/) at _The Online Citizen_ blog

> The poor response shows that if every couple supports the campaign to make

> terrorism except to investigate what thousands of couple do every night on
> bed, to assess whether excessive force was used on the partner. If excessive
> force was indeed used and tantamount to marital rape, the Police may take
> months to investigate. In the meantime, the couple reconciles and settles
> another round of pleasure on bed to resolve the dispute and do not want to
> pursue further. All the Police efforts go down the drain. I would suggest

> family and domestic problems thoroughly first before embarking on this

Btan [believes](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/10/petition-against-marital-
rape-off-to-slow-start/) the organizers failed to gather enough signatures
because it lacks genuine public support

> Petitioners are still in denial. The lack of signature is not because of
> lack of publicity or drive but because most people know this petition is
> silly and nonsensical.
>
> The petitioners insult the people, especially women, by assuming they cannot
> take care of themselves when they have the full weight of the law behind
> them.  
>  It is better they direct their energies to more worthy cause, like
> establishing a genuine two-party system in Singapore where our citizens are
> not whipped like slaves and foreigners entering en mass diluting our
> national spirit.
>
> The house is burning and they are worrying about a bad hair day?
>
> Get your priorities right.
