It is not secret that corruption is a major problem in Nepal. According to
[_Transparency International_
(TI)](http://www.nepalnews.com/main/index.php/news-
archive/2-political/2459-nepal-ranks-143rd-in-anti-corruption-scale.htm), the
country stands 143rd (down from 121) among 180 countries on its anti-
corruption scale. New Zealand being the least corrupt and Somalia the most.

TI says that the reason for the country's seemingly unconquerable corruption
malice is:

> “political instability and weak executive in Nepal with the increased
> corruption level. Although, this year was relatively peaceful in Nepal,
> corruption has increased as the law implementing agency has become weaker
> due to various issues related to transition,”

_Mohan Nepali_ at _Groundreport_ [says](http://www.groundreport.com/World/Oil-
price-goes-up-in-Nepal/2911979):

> Nepal is yet far behind in the combat against all-pervasive corruption, ill-
> governance and dysfunctions of its state mechanisms.
>
> The present rise in the petroleum price is also considered as an indicator
> of the heavy influence of black market forces, operating in nexus with
> political players, on state power mechanisms.

[_Dr. Hari Bansha Dulal_](http://drdulal.blogspot.com/2009/11/crime-
corruption-edging-out-politics.html), a well known political commentator,
reminds that the culture of corruption has some highly placed promoters.

> “It is not only the poor local politicians trying to establish a foothold in
> politics who are engaged in looting the state; the so-called top leaders of
> major political parties have not given up their right to loot the state

The culture of corruption in Nepal is not limited to the government and
politicians. Sadly, social life has also fallen victim to this disease.
[_Krishna
Bhusal_](http://krishnabhusalkawasoti.blogspot.com/2009/11/corruption-in-
nepal-root-prevalance-and.html) writes in his blog how marriages-with high
dowry demands from the groom's family and the bridal side willing to ignore
character imperfections of the groom if he is in well place position within
the government (where he is able to extract undue political and economic
benefit) is affecting the sanctity of social relationships.

In recent years, due to large number of Nepali workers traveling abroad in
search of employment, immigration and border security has also morphed into a
virtual gold mine for those officers seeking undue benefits. In a blog by
Nepali officers, [_B.
Basnet_](http://nepalofficers.blogspot.com/2009/06/corruption-issues-in-nepal-
immigration.html)-who was recently transferred to a different department,
discusses why immigration staff find corruption so enticing.

> “In Immigration, the illegal travelers are the source of major illegal
> income. Normally fair travelers are not under targeted income source list.
> The types and volume of illegal or curtailed travelers are amazing. Most of
> the illegal work is done with the pre-consent and coordination of higher
> level official of the Ministry and Department. The percentage of such income
> immediately distributed through their agents. So, it is stupid to blame only
> to the junior immigration staffs for corruption matters.”

Basnet says that reforming immigration should start from the higher level
officials.

To gauge the scale of Nepal's culture of corruption, [here is an YouTube
video](http://www.youtube.com/v/HteZP1ucPMI&hl=en_US&fs=1&) from Kathmandu's
Avenues TV. You can see how a community water distribution project in district
of Salyan's materials buying process is rigged.

“Corruption affects us all,”
[recognizes](http://www.un.org/en/events/anticorruptionday/) UN Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon in his message on the International Anti-Corruption Day
today.

Corruption is entrenched in Nepal. Culture, social relationships, business and
government-all affected by this malice. Unless the people and the government
work together to end social acceptance of the practice, it is unlikely that
honesty is going to make a comeback in Nepal.
