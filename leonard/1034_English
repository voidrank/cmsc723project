Qatar has been abuzz with events over the past few months: an [international
film festival](http://www.dohatribecafilm.com/), a nail-biting woman's [tennis
championship](http://www.sonyericsson-
championships.com/page/Home/0,,12910,00.html), and now, the [Brazil-England
friendly football
match](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/sep/23/england-brazil-friendly-
qatar) on November 14.

The game has drummed up a great deal of excitement and apprehension here, as
residents wonder how conservative Qatar will handle the inevitable influx of
rowdy football fans this weekend.

On the forum _[Qatar Living](http://www.qatarliving.com/node/787677)_, family
man _HDY_ solicits advice on whether to buy tickets to the match:

> Do you think that such matches are suitable for families? Shall I expect

_Secret1_ tried to reassure him, but caused a stir with his comments:

> I really think theres no problem here for families…. Its Qatar man not

Though the exact number of people flying in for the match is unknown, the
[England Supporters Club](http://www.england-supporters.com) reported that
10,000 tickets were sold to British football fans within 48 hours of the box
office opening.

[Khalifa International Stadium](

for the Doha 2006 Asian Games and where Saturday's match will be held, holds
50,000 people.

The match, added QV, will be a test for Qatar, which is bidding for the [World

Some residents drew on past experiences to reassure others that the football
match will be a family-friendly event.

Indeed, such values are why British football fans should take care not to
offend, warns one organization.

The [Footballer Supporters’
Federation](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2712524/England-

It added that public drunkenness, going bare-chested, rude gestures and overt
PDAs could also lead to court  
in the Gulf state.

In a separate thread on _[Qatar
Living](http://www.qatarliving.com/node/785967)_ , forum members debated the
best way to handle any potential bad behavior.

_Jervis_ was more optimistic after being impressed by Qatar's hands-off
approach to the Doha Tribeca Film Festival (DTFF).

On another note, many Qatar bloggers expressed disappointment that English
footballer [David Beckham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham) won't
be playing in Saturday's match as his American Major League Soccer team Los
Angeles Galaxy [progresses to the MLS Western
Conference](http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/140/world-
cup-2010/2009/11/10/1615558/la-galaxy-win-forces-david-beckham-out-of-england-
squad) final on Friday.

On _Twitter_ , [v3nomous](http://twitter.com/v3nomous/status/5585002015), who
flew to Doha for the match, said:

> Damn.. Beckham is not playing this Saturday.. :( bummer..

[IvanGiesbrecht ](http://twitter.com/IvanGiesbrecht/status/5554299830) was
more concerned about Mrs. Beckham:

> What about Posh? Any chance she'll still be able to make it?
