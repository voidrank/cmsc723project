insecurity) and bloggers discussing the issues worldwide._

As the [Horn of Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa) deals
with what the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is calling the [“most
severe food security emergency in the world
today,”](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/86457/icode/) experts warn that
conditions in famine-stricken Somalia are likely to [further
deteriorate.](http://newsone.com/world/associatedpress2/somalia-famine/)

**Over 12 million impacted**

Triggered by a combination of the worst drought in 60 years, conflict and high
food prices, the food crisis in northeast Africa is affecting [more than 12
million people](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/82543/icode/), according
to the FAO. While countries such as Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya have been
severely impacted, Somalia has been hardest hit, facing the worst food
security crisis in Africa in the last 20 years.

Five areas of Somalia are now suffering from famine, which is expected to
spread to two more regions soon and even further in coming months. It has
already [killed tens of thousands of
people](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/82387/icode/I), including [some
29,000 children](http://www.undispatch.com/what-can-be-done-about-the-somalia-
famine-hint-its-not-a-problem-than-can-be-droned-away) in the past three
months. Another [3.7 million people across Somalia are in
crisis](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/86457/icode/). Of these, 3.2
million are in need of immediate lifesaving assistance.

In response, the FAO has held two emergency meetings in less than a month, the
most recent of which was [last
week](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/86848/icode/), to determine steps
for dealing with the disaster.

But David Dorward, a professor at Australia’s La Trobe University, says on
website The Conversation, that there is [one
reason](http://theconversation.edu.au/from-fear-to-famine-the-politics-of-
hunger-in-the-horn-of-africa-2662) why Somalia has been more severely affected
by this food crisis:

> While droughts are caused by weather – the failure of the rains – famines
> are invariably political…
>
> Crops have failed and livestock perished for want of pasture. But the
> problem is not spread evenly across the drought-affected region…
>
> The famine has affected each part of the Horn in different ways. In each
> port, each capital, each refugee camp, politics decides who, and how many,
> will starve.

**Continuous conflict**

Somalia has experienced ongoing conflict since its civil war began in 1991.
While there is a transitional government in place in the capital Mogadishu,
the Islamic militant group al-Shabaab controls large portions of southern
Somalia, where much of the famine is occurring. Al-Shabaab has banned many
international aid groups, alleging ulterior motives on their part, and
preventing hungry people from leaving the country, according to [media
sources](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/16/world/la-fg-somalia-human-
rights-20110816).

John Campbell, blogging on the Council on Foreign Relations’ site, mostly
[blames al-Shabaab](http://blogs.cfr.org/campbell/2011/08/02/somalia-famine-
finally-captures-the-news-cycle/) for the crisis:

> In effect, al-Shabaab bears the most responsibility for the famine. The
> terrorist group continues to block Western aid workers during a drought that
> has displaced close to two million people, or a quarter of Somalia’s entire
> population. A few years ago, Shabaab dismantled a child vaccination
> campaign, claiming it was a Western plot; that program could have saved many
> children who have since succumbed to measles.

Suspected measles cases in Somalia have [increased by over 660
percent](http://reliefweb.int/node/442706) compared to the same time last
year, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, and cases of cholera are also on the rise. But a report released last
week by Human Rights Watch says all parties to Somalia’s armed conflict [are
contributing to the catastrophe](http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/14/somalia-
end-war-crimes-help-tackle-famine-0).

An Associated Press investigation revealed last week that sacks of food meant
for starving Somalis are being [stolen and sold in
markets.](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gEpnEF-
DPQMCkM6magQe9jH5bPDg?docId=59d9ba3f7a3743029faa9edcf4142961) Soaring prices
are also adding to the population's inability to access food. The prices of
local food staples in Somalia have increased by up to 240 percent in the past
nine months, exceeding the previous record high in 2008, according to [media
reports.](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/spike-in-
food-prices-worsens-east-african-famine/article2130748/)

Another cause of the crisis, says Dave Algoso, an international development
professional in Kenya, on his blog Find What Works is the [failure to respond
to the crisis early.](http://findwhatworks.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/famine/)
Rebecca Sargent, blogging on a peace of conflict, also blames, among many
other factors, [large land lease “land
grabs.”](http://apeaceofconflict.com/2011/08/03/the-over-simplified-narrative-
of-the-somali-famine/)

The crisis has forced Somalis to flee to neighboring countries, including
Ethiopia, Djibouti and, particularly, Kenya. The number of refugees at Kenya's
Dadaab complex has reached [around
400,000](http://www.unhcr.org/print/4e2019869.html), even though it was built
to hold 90,000, with an average of 1,300 Somalis arriving daily. In a series
for the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Samuel Loewenberg [reports on
Dadaab's “disastrously overcrowded” refugee
camps.](http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/kenya-africa-hunger-malnutrition-
drought-oil-dadaab-refugees)

As aid workers struggle to get food and water to those in need, some bloggers
wonder what they can do. Ann Freeman, blogging on Upside My Head (Pay
Attention Now), lists [three ways to
help](http://embraceyouragecauseyoulivin.blogspot.com/2011/08/famine-in-
somalia-and-horn-africa-what.html), including increasing awareness. The World
Food Programme has created a
[quiz](http://gifts.wfp.org/quiz/hornofafrica?lead_source=twitterpost-wfp-hoa-
quiz) to do just that. Cynthia Bertelsen, blogging on Gherkins and Tomatoes,
wonders why more food writers and bloggers [aren't discussing the
famine](http://gherkinstomatoes.com/2011/08/12/famine-in-somalia/).

**Search for solutions**

While emergency aid and short-term solutions are necessary, international
agricultural experts who gathered at the FAO emergency meeting last week also
stressed the need for [long-term actions and
policies](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/86848/icode/) to prevent
future famines. Kenya's agriculture minister, [for
example](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/18/food-
experts-solutions-somalia-famine), emphasized the need for drought-resistant
seeds, small irrigation projects and infrastructure and examining the link
between food production problems and climate change.

Hannah Ellison, writing for the Population Institute's blog, says for other
reforms to work, [family
planning](http://blog.populationinstitute.org/2011/08/12/interrupting-the-
cycle-of-hunger-in-the-horn/) must also be part of the strategy. Jeffrey
Swindle, blogging on USAID’s Global Broadband and Innovations site, discusses
information and communications technology's [potentially important
role](http://gbiportal.net/2011/08/09/how-to-stop-the-next-famine-in-somalia-
internet-infrastructure/) in organizing humanitarian relief efforts and
preventing famines. United States professor Marion Nestle, blogging on Food
Politics, says [Somalia's politics](http://www.foodpolitics.com/2011/08/q-and-
a-global-food-security/) must also be addressed:

> We keep making the same mistakes.
>
> This is because it seems—and in the case of Somalia _is_ —much easier to
> deal with the immediate demand for food aid than to address the underlying
> politics that caused the problem in the first place.
>
> But if we don’t deal with the underlying politics, the same tragedies occur
> again and again.

Despite the dire situation, some bloggers try to remain hopeful. Somali model
Iman, blogging on The Huffington Post, lists [five seeds of hope for
Somalia](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/iman/five-seeds-of-hope-for-
somalia_b_926155.html), including the strength of the country's women. Ed
Carr, blogging on Open The Echo Chamber, points out that if humans have caused
this disaster, [we can also prevent the next
one](http://www.edwardrcarr.com/opentheechochamber/2011/07/21/drought-does-
not-equal-famine/). Dave Algoso [injects a little
hope](http://findwhatworks.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/famine/) on his blog, Find
What Works, by sharing three uplifting videos. He says:

> Images of starving famine victims often reinforce pessimistic stereotypes of
> hopeless Africans unable to do much for themselves. Against such images, we
> like to inject nuance and point to the complexity of the situation, in the
> hope of countering the stereotypes and provoking a better response from the
> consumers of Western media.
>
> But another possible antidote is to simply combat simplistic hope _less_
> ness with simplistic hope _ful_ ness.
