Since Prime Minister Najib Razak’s unveiling of the plan to construct the
100-storey Warisan Merdeka tower during the [Budget
2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/17/malaysia-
budget-2011-announced-2/), Malaysians have come up to protest against the
construction of the tower.

Most Malaysians are against the idea as they believe that it does not serve
any purpose- it will not be the tallest building in the world, and Malaysia
already has iconic skyscrapers- the Petronas Twin Towers and the Kuala Lumpur
Tower.

the announcement of the $5 billion MYR (approximately $1.6 billion USD)
project, many Malaysians have taken to using Facebook to protest, with the
most popular being the [‘1M Malaysians Reject 100-storey Mega Tower’ page
](http://www.facebook.com/NoMegaTower)which has garnered more than 200,000
‘likes’ from users in just slightly more than two weeks. Even a
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J2Y5xt_BQQ) was created to oppose the
project.

However, the government’s stand is that the project will benefit the country’s
economy and provide jobs, which would then benefit the citizens.

Adrian Ng, a Malaysian, [wrote in Loyarburok](http://www.loyarburok.com/the-
system/bolehland/oppose-menara-warisan-merdeka-and-for-that-reason-i-

Adrian’s view is also largely supported by many Malaysians. However, not all
Malaysians are against it. Poobalan offered a slightly more [less critical
stance](http://poobalan.com/blog/borninmalaysia/2010/10/29/impact-of-menara-
warisan-merdeka/):

> surrounding area. Can suggest to improve transportation in tandem with the

> city centre, so not a big problem to attract tenants.

Popular blogger Ahirudin Attan, in [retelling a
conversation](http://rockybru.com.my/2010/10/latest-bru-in-malay-mail.html) he
