    Berlin Wall in front of Brandenburg Gate – 1989, by [](</dd)

[](</dd)

[Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall not so numerous Russian
bloggers remember, celebrate and discuss the historical event that some call
“the most important event in the history of the 20th century.” For most of the
Russian bloggers ‘The Fall’ is a memory from childhood/adolescence, an act
rather mythical than real.](</dd)

Some bloggers use the date to remind their readers about the current political
situation, some practice their cynicism, but most of the bloggers ask
themselves: “Why no one talks about this date? Why it is not publicly
celebrated?”
