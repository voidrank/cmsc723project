_Zied Mhirsi_ is a Tunisian doctor, [blogger](http://www.zizoufromdjerba.com/)
and activist, currently based in the United States, who is dedicated to
fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Middle East and North Africa. In
September 2008 he started a blog called _[HIV in the Arab
World](http://arabhiv.blogspot.com/)_ [Ar], which monitors Arab media coverage
of HIV/AIDS.

A wide range of subjects are covered in the blog, such as an [awareness-
raising campaign](http://arabhiv.blogspot.com/2009/09/blog-post_4829.html)
[Ar] in Tunisia, reasons for the [spread of AIDS in
Iraq](http://arabhiv.blogspot.com/2009/09/blog-post_3992.html) [Ar], and a
[Saudi religious scholar's opinion](http://arabhiv.blogspot.com/2009/09/blog-
post_2116.html) [Ar] on the permissibility of marrying a person with HIV/AIDS.

In this post, Zied tells _Global Voices Online_ about his work, and how it all
began.

**What prompted your interest in working in the field of HIV/AIDS?**

> A family member died of HIV/AIDS when I was 11. This was in the 80s and at
> that time there was nothing we can do. This event shaped my life and made
> HIV/AIDS become part of the issues that are dear to me. During my medical
> school, I joined the [_Tunisian Association Against
> AIDS_](http://www.newint.org/columns/makingwaves/2008/01/01/tunisia/) (
> _Association Tunisienne de Lutte Contre le Sida_ ) and never left the HIV
> field ever since. I worked in Tunisia, Lebanon and Sudan so far and I’m
> looking forward to help my colleagues and friends in more countries.

**What are the greatest challenges for people living with HIV in the Arab
world?**

> Stigma and discrimination is definitely on the top of the list. Stigma is
> partially due in my opinion to the fear-creating approach that our
> governments and activists adopted as a main prevention message. Fear is
> often paired with ignorance and stigma is a consequence of this mix. Stigma
> makes it more difficult to convince people to get tested, and hence to get
> treated. It also contributes in denying basic rights to those who are
> infected and does not allow them to have security regarding their future
> (work, family…).

**When did you start the _[HIV in the Arab
World](http://arabhiv.blogspot.com/)_ blog, and who are you aiming at? **

> I believe in the power of media in changing behaviours and bringing
> awareness. For many years Arab media has been neglecting the issue of
> HIV/AIDS and during the last years I observed some changes in the way they
> framed HIV/AIDS. I created this to better follow the way Arab media reports
> about AIDS and to offer to those interested a webpage that collects all the
> articles that talk about this epidemic in the MENA [Middle East and North
> Africa] region. It is also a way for me to keep connected with the MENA HIV
> news.

**You also have a[Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=36562668250) associated with the
_HIV in the Arab World_ blog – who is it for?**

> I left the region in 2007 and moved to the United States where I work for
> the department of Global Health at the University of Washington. This move
> made it difficult for me to keep in touch with my friends and colleagues
> from the region. I created this Facebook group to reconnect with my friends
> and to offer an opportunity for activists and HIV/AIDS professionals to meet
> and discuss about the issues that are important to them. It is a primarily a
> networking tool and also a forum where news and emerging issues are
> discussed. The group is open only to those who are working in the field and
> has already more than 42 members from all over the Arab world.

**How many HIV-positive people are there in Tunisia? Can you describe the work
of the[ _Tunisian Association Against AIDS_](http://www.atlsida.org/) [fr]?**

> Tunisia’s HIV epidemic is relatively small (3000 estimated cases/10,000,000
> inhabitants). We estimate the prevalence to be one of the lowest in the
> world. This is due to male circumcision, a good healthcare system,
> conservative sexual behaviours and the government/civil society’s work.
> There is however a lot that needs to be done in order to prevent the disease
> from spreading larger. These actions include a need to target vulnerable
> groups with better designed prevention interventions and more work on the
> policy and epidemiology level.
>
> I joined the Tunisian HIV association in 1997. This NGO is the largest and
> one of the most popular ones in Tunisia. We work in the areas of HIV
> prevention, care and support, and advocacy. We cover the Tunisian territory
> with more than 5 local offices and we participate in many international
> activities and networks that represent to us a source of funding and
> partnerships.
