[﻿Marcelo Bielsa ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa)–also known as
“el loco” (the crazy one)– is the coach of the Chilean national football team,
but for many Chileans he is much more than that. In the South American
Football Confederation ([CONMEBOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL))
qualifying stage for the 2010 World Cup,[ Bielsa made history by taking his
boys to the second spot
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_\(CONMEBOL\)#Standings)with
only one point less than the leader, Brazil. He is also known for his
statements, often making headlines for his wordy, yet usually admired
opinions. But these days the talk around Bielsa has more to do with his
actions than with his words, and Twitter has become one of the main stages for
Chileans to voice their opinions.

Before leaving for South Africa, the Chilean football team was bid farewell by
[President Sebastian
Piñera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Pi%C3%B1era). In that instance,
Marcelo Bielsa approached the president, shook his hand and quickly walked
off. A [video ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LzR1DdEScE&feature=related)of
the incident soon spread on the web and mixed comments on the coach's actions
spread online; some considered Bielsa to be cold and rude, and others
(especially those who don't like the president) defended Bielsa and thought it
was not a big deal. On July 1, Sebastian Piñera received the national team in
the presidential palace, welcoming them back to their country after they were
eliminated from the World Cup in a game against Brazil. Once again, Bielsa's
handshake (or almost lack of it) caused an uproar on the web. A [video
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx7GQx5xxSE)of today's event was quickly
uploaded to YouTube.

“Bielsa” soon became[ a trending topic](https://twitter.com/#search?q=Bielsa)
on Twitter, as Chileans used 140 characters or less to publish their thoughts
on the incident:

Such an ugly attitude of the “Loco” Bielsa with President Piñera he almost
left him with his hand in the air. There is something called EDUCATION/
[manners].

He [Bielsa] was not rude, At least he offered him [the president] his hand, I
wouldn't have shaken hands with the president, Bielsa is not a hypocrite like
the president.

once again i did not like Bielsa's attitude, beyond the differences there
might be [between them], not greeting [the president] doesn't speak well of
him [Bielsa].

One thing is political color [opinion] and another thing is education. Is
there a coach that can train Marcelo Bielsa in good manners?

bielsa is rude and piñera is a profiteer and that's the end of it

Bielsa's lack of courtesy does not annul the good job he has done, but [show]
minimum respect to the president of Chile, no???

Clearly bielsa doesn't like sebastian piñera and instead of being cynical he
acts like that and he has every right to do so

Mr. Bielsa don't be rude. President Piñera doesn't deserve your disrespect, is
that your example to our youth? …BEHAVE!

I like the low profile Bielsa keeps… he greeted him in his own way, what where
you waiting for? a hug??

let's stop the criticism with bielsa… let's not lower ourselves as a country
arguing over how to greet a president

Many draw political conclusions to the incident because Bielsa's treatment of
[former left-leaning president Michelle
Bachelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet) is very different to
his treatment of right-leaning president Sebastian Piñera. On a [video
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yWBJeMQREU&feature=related)on YouTube, in a
gathering similar to the good-bye by President Piñera, Michelle Bachelet
visits the team and Bielsa dedicates a few words to her publicly; the two are
then seen walking, talking and similing. Michelle Bachelet also accompanied
the team to South Africa, staying in the same hotel, as reported by _[La
Tercera [es]](http://latercera.com/contenido/688_268327_9.shtml)_.

Chilean comedian Stefan Kramer recently released [a sketch where he makes a
parody out of the two encounters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1x1eA_hZrQ);
although the dialog is in Spanish, as in real life –and as many critics would
say– in this case actions speak louder than words.
