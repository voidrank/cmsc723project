A 23 year-old woman was stripped, beaten and raped in a moving bus in South
Delhi on December 16, 2012, [stirring shock and
outrage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20765320) in India.

The victim and her male companion, who was also beaten with an iron rod, were
then thrown off the bus, and dumped semi naked near Delhi's Mahipalpur
flyover. She is now in the hospital with critical injuries.

The victim, a physiotherapist and her companion, a 28-year-old software
engineer, were [returning from watching a movie, when they
got](http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/23-year-old-girl-
gangraped-in-moving-bus-in-Delhi-main-accused-arrested/Article1-973767.aspx)
on to the private luxury bus which was en route to Dwarka. The bus driver
along with six others, allegedly gang raped the woman. The police [tracked
down](http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/how-the-police-cracked-the-delhi-
gang-rape-case-306698) the bus and have [arrested four
persons](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/299320/delhi-rape-4-arrested-
attempt.html).

Every year hundreds of rapes are registered in Delhi and hundreds more are not
reported. In India rape is considered taboo which leads to few cases being
registered. This incident has [raised a lot of questions regarding public
safety](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/12/18/economics-journal-the-
delhi-rape-case-examined/) in the Indian capital.

The matter has been the talk of the town and was also been [addressed in the
parliament](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20765869). But the most
buzz was found on social media.

Perhaps Moonmoon Ghosh's Twitter status catches the frustration most:

[A Woman in Today's India](http://www.rediff.com/news/column/rapes-happen-in-
india-because-we-are-a-callous-nation/20121218.htm) is furious:

> This is not the first time it has happened. It will not be the last!
>
> It will happen again, and again, and again, multiple times in a day, across
> this great, goddess-worshipping nation called India. [..]
>
> Rapes happen in India, because we are a callous nation.

[An Indian Homemaker](http://indianhomemaker.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/girl-
gang-raped-in-moving-bus-in-delhi/) has a lot of questions:

> What do you think made these rapists in Delhi so fearless? [..]
>
> Do you think our society really sees rapists as serious criminals? Many of
> us seem to see rape as something that happens when a rapist is not able to
> control himself. It seems we have special standards for judging sexual
> criminals, and rapists know this.

[Ritu Lalit](http://phoenixritu.com/an-open-letter-to-social-activists-law-

makers and law enforcers. An excerpt:

> I would like to draw your attention to the actual downtrodden of our

> cant you froth in the mouth for them? The most public figures among you are
> women, and they freak about something that happened in 2002!

[The Pregnant Thought](http://www.hiyer.net/2012/12/open-up-kyunki-dilli-ab-
door-nahi.html) opines:

> The rape culture in delhi was not born yesterday. It is the illegitimate
> child of our unruly upbringing. Delhi hasn't failed. We have failed.
>
> We have strict laws, we don't have proper implementation. More than stricter
> laws, we need a more open culture. What kind of culture is this where sex is
> a bad word, and rape is a norm.
>
> What would it take for us to understand that “to address an issue, you need
> to undress it”
>
> Wake up. Open up!
