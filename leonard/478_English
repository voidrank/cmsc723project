[![Puerto Rico Police](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

content/uploads/2010/10/policia.jpg)On October 6th the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) arrested 133 people in Puerto Rico, including 89 police
officers, in what the US Department of Justice called [“the biggest police
corruption investigation in the history of the
FBI”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11489547). The police
officers were accused of providing protection to local drug dealers. This
represents a very serious blow to the already tarnished reputation of Puerto
Rico’s police department after very high profile cases of police brutality the
past few months. Puerto Ricans are wondering how and why things have fallen so
low.

Criminal justice professor [Gary
Gutiérrez](http://www.80grados.net/author/gary-gutierrez/) worries in [an
article for the digital online magazine 80
Grados](http://www.80grados.net/2010/10/servir-y-proteger-la-insanidad-
tambien-viste-de-azul-3/) [ES] about the delegitimization of the authority of
the police after these arrests:

> Esa deslegitimación del oficial del orden público, justificada o no, puede
> ser peligrosa pues termina fomentando el espiral de violencia social. Si las
> instituciones del país, como la Policía, se ven como ilegítimas, los
> ciudadanos no tienen por que someterse a su autoridad.

This delegitimization of the public order officer, justified or not, can be
dangerous as it ends up fomenting the spiral of social violence. If the
country’s institutions, like the police, are viewed as illegitimate, the
citizens do not have to submit to its authority.

Gutiérrez urges his readers to look at this problem of police corruption not
as something that exists outside society, but rather as a product of a
consumerist society:

> Son frutos de una sociedad cuya cultura se basa en acaparar bienes de
> consumo que se convierten en símbolos del éxito. Esta es una sociedad donde
> el valor del individuo no radica en su capacidad de producir, ayudar y
> solidarizarse con el colectivo.

These are the products of a society whose culture is based in the accumulation
of consumer goods, which becomes the symbols of success. This is a society
where the value of the individual does not reside in its capacity to produce,
help and have solidarity with the collective.

The team of the [#EnProfundo](http://www.enprofundo.somoscarbono.com/)[ES]
podcast also discussed the possible causes for such widespread police
corruption on its [29th episode on October
10th](http://www.enprofundo.somoscarbono.com/2010/10/11/enprofundo-29-te-voy-
a-llenar-la-cara-de-eso/). Twitter user
[@Martillo20lbs](http://twitter.com/#!/Martillo20lbs), a military police
officer, was a special guest and he voiced his opinion on why the police is so
prone to corruption and to the use of unnecessary force.

@Martillo20lbs argued that one of the main causes was politicians promising an
increase in the number of police officers as part of their campaign promises.
This has resulted in lax and dangerous practices by the police department
which is under pressure to recruit whatever artificial number of police
officers politicians have set:

> …tú pasas ese _screening_ inicial y lo único que tienes que hacer es ir a la
> academia y graduarte. That’s it. Ese es el problema fundamental en Puerto
> Rico: que no hacen un debido _screening_ de todos los aplicantes…

…you pass that initial screening, and from that point forward all you have to
do is go to the [police] academy and graduate. That’s it. That’s the
fundamental problem in Puerto Rico: there is not a proper screening of all
applicants…

@Martillo20lbs states that this lack of screening combined with inadequate
training results in a corrupt culture:

> …la Policía de Puerto Rico no tiene una cultura en donde tiene unos valores
> centrales, que es proteger la vida del ser humano y velar por los intereses
> de la población de Puerto Rico. El policía que llega ahora mismo a la
> Policía de Puerto Rico llega o porque no tiene dinero o porque salió del
> caserío y el bichote lo está mandando para la Policía de Puerto Rico para
> que cuando salga pida el traslado hacia su caserío y continue haciendo lo
> que estaba haciendo.

…the police of Puerto Rico does not have a culture with a set of core values,
which should be to protect human life and safeguard the interests of the
people of Puerto Rico. The policeman that is coming in right now into the
Puerto Rican police force is there either because he does not have any money,
or he is coming from the projects and the local drug dealer sent him to the
Police Department so when he comes out [from the academy] he requests a
transfer back to the projects and keeps doing whatever it was he used to do.

Just like Gutiérrez, @Martillo20lbs argues that developing a social conscience
is central to changing the culture of corruption.

> …el que se metió a la policía de Puerto Rico para renumerar económicamente
> está mal, porque es un servidor público. Tú tienes que tener un cierto grado
> de devoción para combatir el crimen.

…whoever has joined the Puerto Rico police to make money is wrong, because he
is a public servant. You must have a certain degree of devotion to fight
crime.

With a corruption problem that seems to be tied to deep rooted societal ills,
Puerto Rico’s police seems to have a long road ahead to rebuild its
reputation.
