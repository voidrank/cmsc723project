When news of Osama Bin Laden's death broke on May 2, 2011, journalists in the
United States (US) were tweeting and using social media just like other
citizens to report their feelings and what they saw on the streets and even
airplanes. It marks an interesting contrast to how 9/11 itself was reported in
2001, when social media was still only a nascent technology, especially in the
world of professional journalism. Have journalists finally become citizen
reporters?

Ed Henry from _CNN_ tweeted from celebrations in front of the White House in
Washington D.C.:

> cheers of joy behind me outside WH making me want to cry. wow.

Journalist and photographer Thomas Cain, from national community news company
_[Main Street Connect](http://mainstreetconnect.us) _tweeted the moment he
landed at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City on May 2:

> @[ThomasCain](http://twitter.com/ThomasCain/status/64896845024985088): Just
> landed in JFK and the pilot came over speakers to inform us of bin laden's
> death. The whole plane just erupted in applause!

Jim Forman from the _KING 5_ Night Team in Western Washington also tweeted an
airplane experience:

>

> 9/11 widow on my flight. In tears. Comforted by entire cabin. Life altering

Not all experiences in US airports were jubilant, as security levels were
raised:

> @[tmsruge](http://twitter.com/tmsruge/status/65029363795623936): OBL's death
> = extra level of security at checkin.. By “level” I mean 7 extra check
> points within 100ft radius + extra rude passport stamper

In New York at the “Ground Zero” site of the former World Trade Center,
journalists reported on jubilant crowds.

Matthew Bishop, the New York bureau chief of _The Economist_ also tweeted from
here:

Writer and _New York Times_ employee Jennifer Mascia said:

> Seriously cannot believe how young this crowd is. 9/11 must have been the

On the following morning in New York, Jeff Jarvis, an early blogger and one of
the first journalists to [report on the aftermath of the World Trade Center
attacks](http://jeffjarvis.tvheaven.com/story/), retraced his steps to Ground
Zero:

> @[jeffjarvis](http://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/65033827017437184): I've
> retraced my steps here on 9/11. I see an augmented reality from my memory
> over the city.

In his blog _Buzz Machine_ , he wrote a [moving
reminiscence](http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/05/02/bin-laden-dead-at-last/)
on how 9/11 defined both his career as a fierce advocate of citizen
journalism, as well as the medium itself:

> As soon as I saw the news, I turned by reflex to Twitter. Twitter is our
> Times Square on this victory day. A reporter asked me tonight whether this
> would be a defining moment for Twitter. Another one, I said. Today, our
> grand shared experience around news is no longer defined as all of us
> watching TV. Now, TV is in the background. Twitter is where many of us come
> to find out the news and share our thoughts and feelings.
