In May, the second India and Africa Summit was held at the African Union
headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This Summit should lead [to the
adoption](http://www.brazzaville-
adiac.com/index.php?action=depeche&dep_id=49418&oldaction=liste&regpay_id=0&them_id=0&cat_id=2&ss_cat_id=0&LISTE_FROM=20&select_month=05&select_year=2011)
of two documents: the Declaration of Addis Ababa and the Cooperation Plan
between India and Africa (which can be found on the official website of the
[African Union](http://au.int/en/summitfr/AfricaIndia) [all links in French
unless otherwise indicated].

The Summit has inspired comments from Francophone African bloggers on the
competing influences of China and India in Africa. It has also inspired
_TheLeadersOfTheWorld_ [to post this short satirical video

Blog _[journaldutchad.com](http://journaldutchad.com/article.php?aid=1259)_
gave the key statistics of the Summit:

> India will therefore break its piggybank and cash meters are already going
> crazy with a list of loans totalling 2400 billion CFA francs (5 billion USD)
> for the African continent over the next three years. Moreover, the Prime
> Minister, Manmohan Singh, who shares the same vision for the continent,
> intends to grant a subsidy of 336 billion CFA francs (700 million USD) in
> grants to Africa.’

[Patrice Garner](http://www.afrique7.com/author/patrice-garner) on
_afrique7.com_ [gives further
details](http://www.afrique7.com/economie/1418-afrique-la-cooperation-
economique-inde-afrique.html) on the new projects:

> Acts speaking louder than words, and in line with this new partnership, an
> Institute of information technology will be built in Ghana, another
> Institute for educational planning in Burundi, an Institute of foreign trade
> in Uganda and a diamond institute in Botswana.

Indian investments are already [visible
](http://www.afrik.com/article22925.html)in the daily life of Africans,
reminds [Assanatou Baldé](http://www.afrik.com/auteur12526.html) on
_Afrik.com_ :

> One of the most important investor is the Indian telecom giant Bharti
> Airtel, which has disbursed $ 10 billion to access the mobile telephony
> industry in 15 African countries. Indian car maker Tata trades in 11
> countries on the continent and has the monopoly of public transportation in

A debate has opened on the platform _Flamme d'Afrique,_ _les autres voix de
l’Afrique (_ Flame of Africa, other African voices) opened by the Panos
Institute website, where Ousseini Issa [compares the Chinese and Indian
approaches](http://www.panos-
multimedia.org/indeaf/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76) in
Africa:

> The way Delhi manages trade and cooperation with Africa differs from the
> Chinese way, with a swoop on mainly private local companies, but bought with
> subsidies from the Indian state, via a merger and acquisition strategy,
> whereas China favors direct trade with governments. But India also has this
> feature: that it tries to develop approaches inclusive of the regional
> economic institutions such as ECOWAS and SADC. […] the issue is, for many,
> the prospect of the continent building different relationships from those
> marking its exploitation for centuries, under the north-south axis.

Commenter _[NIBIZI](http://www.panos-
multimedia.org/indeaf/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=74:commentaires&catid=46:commentaire#comment-2)
_hopes this partnership will herald a new era:

> With this new partnership, African leaders should learn a lesson and break
> away from the corrupt ways that have plagued the continent. The culture of
> human rights must come first, if we want to make the most of the dividends,
> which will put an end to wars, and the internal power struggles which have
> prevented Africa from making a good start.

_karl_ is more pragmatic, both confident and [worried](http://www.panos-
multimedia.org/indeaf/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=74), wary
of a possible ” [land
grab](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/18/ethiopia-are-land-grab-deals-
a-path-to-food-security/)” [en]:

> This summit should be an opportunity for Africa to negotiate ways to
> collaborate to solve the critical energy issue. But it should also put an
> end to the lease and sale of African land, while farmers are struggling to
> access them to help achieve food self-sufficiency and to satisfy their right
> to housing

On the _Radio France International_ website, an article on[ the Addis Abeba
Summit](http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20110524-inde-affirme-presence-
afrique#comment-194653 "RFI") has also
[generated](http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20110524-inde-affirme-presence-
afrique#comment-195451) comments from readers. They are much more vocal in
rejecting “[L'indépendance sous haute
surveillance](http://www.lyricsmania.com/armee_francaise_lyrics_alpha_blondy.html)”
(Independence under strict surveillance, lyrics from a song by African singer
[Alpha Blondy](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Blondy "wikipedia")), which
is to say, the post-colonial cooperation model imposed by France.

_Kamerun_ :

> With India and China arriving on the African continent, we are very proud,
> because it will help us shoe away the imperialist thieves who have been
> looting the continent since 1960. […]

_Anonymous_ :

> […] I don't see (President of Ivory Coast) Ouattara grant juicy markets to
> Indians or Chineses and deprive France of them any time soon. Unless he does
> not wish to stay long in power.

_Ma belle Afrique_ :

> The Indian cooperation approach with Africa est more altruist that the one
> privileged by France under Mr. Sarkozy. From now on, Africans must turn
> their back to countries which impose governance at gun point.

_RéaPar_ :

> These forms of cooperation, where Africa's natural resources are coveted by
> many (Europe and the BRIC countries) cannot be a sustainable solution for
> the development of this continent. Cooperation must be built around a long
> term vision that will allow African to sell some day Tata cars to India,
> China or France (ok, I'm going overboard here). This involves training young
> people, democracy, and long term ambitious economic policies, to put an end
> to the outstretched hand policy (begging) of this continent.

The Addis Ababa summit was also an opportunity for a percussionists band from
[Rufisque](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufisque), a city southeast of Dakar,
to bring a touch of West African culture in Ethiopia. On _rufisquenews.com_ ,
Cherif FAYE [announced ](http://www.rufisquenews.com/arts-et-
culture/310-sommet-inde-afrique-a-addis-abeba-le-groupe-l-ker-gi-r-de-bargny-
a-lhonneur.html)they had been invited to perform in Ethiopia by the Embassy of
India in Senegal: ****

> The “ _Kër Gi”_ band from Bargny [should] perform a concert called “ _Guur
> Nduuy”_ which means “ _léboue_ _tradition”_ _._ The “ _Guur Nduuy”_ show
> trace some aspects of the rich immaterial heritage of the
> [léboue](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9bous) community.
