Increasing numbers of loud and littering tourists are damaging the world's
largest mangrove forest, which stretches from Bangladesh to eastern India and
is home to [Royal Bengal Tigers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Tiger)
and a colorful collection of other wildlife that includes spotted deer, birds,
crocodiles, and various species of snakes.

The mild weather of winter at the moment is sure to draw visitors to the
[Sundarbans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans) forest, and with it
throngs of tourists whose careless picnicking and sightseeing destroy the
environment and disturb the animals. [Nearly 100,000 local and international
tourists](http://www.prothom-alo.com/detail/date/2012-12-20/news/314615) [bn]
flock to this UNESCO world heritage site each year, with that number
increasing each year by 20-30 percent.

This issue has fueled debate in local media and the local blogosphere.
