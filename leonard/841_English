In early 2009, Peruvian President Alan García [announced the
creation](http://peru21.pe/noticia/250698/crearan-gran-colegio-mayor-) of the
[President of Peru High School
[es]](http://www.perueduca.edu.pe/colegiomayor/) located in Huampaní, about 25
km east of Lima. The idea consists of an ambitious [educational
project](http://www.universia.edu.pe/noticias/principales/destacada.php?id=71160),
targeting the 500 best high school students from 47 of the best public schools
from across the country. Those admitted will complete their last two years of
high school and will have access to some of the best teachers and facilities
in the country.

Admission is based on a competitive tests, and the results have been in the
process of being announced. However, some are concerned about the access to
the information about the application process. For example, Saravia, from the
blog _[Autoeducación Digital [es]](http://saravia.wordpress.com/)_ raises
[some concerns](http://saravia.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/colegio-mayor-
secundario-preocupaciones/) about the process:

> Un capricho presidencial como lo llamamos desde el inicio a la creación del
> Colegio Mayor se ve envuelto en algo que de haber sido transparente su
> concepción y proceso, se hubiera evitado. Desde el inicio, el Prospecto
> costó mucho “bajarlo” de internet por la forma cómo había sido diseñado. El
> Lima, tal vez quienes tienen internet en su casa, fue fácil, pero quienes
> recurren a cabinas, tuvieron que gastar varios soles para bajar el Prospecto
> como para imprimirlo. ¿Se imagina cómo sería en provincias?

A presidential whim, as we called from the start the creation of the High
School, ends up as something that should have been transparent from its
conception and process, might have been avoided. In the first place, the
informative prospectus was very hard to “download” from the Internet, due to
the way that it was designed. In Lima, maybe for those having Internet at
home, it was easy, but those using public Internet access, one had to spend a
few soles (Peruvian currency) to download the prospectus in order to print it.
Can you imagine how would it be in the provinces?

In addition, Pedro Martínez of the blog _[El Arte de Enseñar
[es]](http://elprofepedro.blogspot.com/)_ raises some other concerns about the
legality of the process, since the High School will be a public school:

> Según la Ley no está permitido que los colegios seleccionen o discriminen
> con evaluaciones el ingreso de los estudiantes y si se va a escoger a los
> mejores alumnos de segundo año de secundaria de las instituciones educativas
> a nivel nacional a través de exámenes sicológicos y académicos, entonces se
> requerirá un régimen legal excepcional.

According to the law, schools can not select nor discriminate a student's
admittance based upon evaluations, and if they are going to choose the best
students from the second level of high schools nationwide with psychological
and academic tests, then an exceptional legal system will be required.

Some Peruvians welcome this new educational process, and one commenter at
[Peru 21 [es]](http://peru21.pe/noticia/250698/crearan-gran-colegio-mayor-),
Arturo writes:

Wonderful idea. In a world, more and more competitive, we need to instill in
our brilliant students the desire to overcome (something forgotten in our
country) and competitiveness. The right to free education is guaranteed for
everyone, but it is fair that the best students from across the country also
have the same opportunities to develop themselves and to develop Peru.
Hopefully the curriculum will not be based on “informing,” but rather on a
complete intellectual, physical, and spiritual “development.”

With the new school year beginning on Monday, March 1, t[media announced
[es]](http://www.correoperu.com.pe/correo/nota.php?txtEdi_id=5&txtSecci_parent=0&txtSecci_id=12&txtNota_id=288748)
the name of the student who got the highest score in the admission test. Her
name is [Yazmín Lazo Cahui [es]](http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/suenos-
mejor-estudiante/20100220/417232), she is 14 years old and lives in
[Arequipa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arequipa)

In the Peruvian educational system, 20 is the highest grade a student can
obtain, and Yazmin received a grade of 17.5. She scored third place on her
written test, but her essay about global warming and its implications on our
daily lives was judged to be so well written, that she earned the highest
overall score.

The announcement that Yazmin, the daughter of a mechanic and a housewife,
received the highest score, was well received in the country because of the
disparities between education in males and females in Peru. Illiteracy affects
17.5% of women, while only 6.1% of men are illiterate, as
[stated](http://www.flora.org.pe/mujercifras.htm) at the website of the
feminist movement [Flora Tristán [es]](http://www.flora.org.pe).

In addition, the 2nd and 3rd highest scores also went to girls: Wendy León
Espinoza and Pamela Rojas Huamanlazo, and both got a grade of 17. The three of
them, as well as the other students who earn their admittance to President of
Peru High School will report to their new school on February 26.
