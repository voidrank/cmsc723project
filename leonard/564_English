and Learn with Georgia_](http://www.tlg.gov.ge/index.php?lang=eng) (TLG) is a
project established by the [Ministry of Education and Science of
Georgia](http://www.mes.gov.ge/?lang=eng) (MES) aiming to recruit 1,000 native
English speakers willing to teach English at Georgian schools for the
2010-2011 academic year. The first wave of teachers arrived in Georgia in the
end of July and the Georgian government expects that all 1,000 will have
started by the end of 2010.

The MES hopes that not only will the teachers help improve the situation with
proficiency in English throughout the country, albeit at the expense of
Russian, but that they will also learn more about Georgia and promote it back
home by sharing stories with their families and friends. Several have already
started their own blogs, for example, and write about everything from their
students to culture and cuisine.

One of them, _drew's blog_ , says that many others in addition to existing
students in Georgia's second largest city of Kutaisi are [eager to learn
English](http://drewsobota.wordpress.com/2010/09/25/address/).

> I’ve added some more teaching hours outside of school. I made some friends

> with. One is Tinico’s (my main companion) English grammar text book that
> she, herself, wrote. She wants me help her finish & be the editor. I’m
> honored. […]

Unlike Drew Sobota, however, not all of the teachers are located in large
cities such as Kutaisi or Tbilisi, the capital, with some sent to the less
well developed regions of the country. Paul Knettel, for example, arrived in
Georgia in August and teaches in Zeda Etseri, a village near Zugdidi in the
west of the country. Writing on _Floating World_ , the American [appears to
have settled in quite
easily](http://paulknettel.wordpress.com/2010/08/31/images-and-words/).

> I am enjoying my time here immensely. The Georgian family is wonderful and

> against a group of Georgians, which was a blast despite the scorching heat:
> so much for a cooler environment than Texas!

However, other TLG teachers do occasionally touch upon some sensitive
subjects. One of them is Neal Zupancic from Slovenia who wrote on his blog,
_Georgia On My Mind_ , [about attitudes towards gender and sex in what still
remains a fairly traditional
country](http://peripateticpedagogue.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/sex-in-
georgia/). The post received more than 200 comments and initiated an intense
discussion.

> At orientation, the TLG staff gave us a bunch of info about dating and
> gender relations in Georgia. The breakdown is familiar: men are expected to
> be sexually experienced when they get married and women are expected to be
> virgins. Of course, this system cannot work without some third factor,
> because how are men to get experience when women are not allowed to have
> sex? So there must exist – or so we can theorize – some group of women who
> are violating the traditional rules. […]
>
> “Dating” in Georgia is vanishingly rare. Instead, there is courtship. A man
> and a woman get together, they date for about two months, and then the
> expectation is that the man will either “do the right thing” or stop fooling
> around and move on. In theory every woman has a “patroni,” or male guardian,
> whose job it is to make sure that the men in these women’s lives “do the
> right thing” – in other words, propose marriage within an acceptable period
> of time, or leave the woman alone.
>
> […]
>
> Finally, a note about talking about sex in Georgia. The subject seems to be
> a lot more taboo than it is in the US. Even when you talk to Georgians about
> dating, they are generally taken aback by the idea that anyone would talk
> publicly about any kind of romantic interactions between men and women. It’s
> pretty strange.

Some of the blogs by TLG teachers can be found on _[Dream is
Destiny](http://dodka.ge/2010/10/13/wildgeorgia/) [GE] _ as well as my own
_[The Young
Georgians](http://theyounggeorgians.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/teach-and-learn-
with-georgia-reflections/)_. As with those blogs [established by some Peace
Corps Volunteers](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/10/14/georgia-peace-
corps-volunteer-blogs/), they might well offer a unique glimpse into life in
Georgia.
