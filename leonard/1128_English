The first week of September in Japan is the [Disaster Prevention
Week](http://www.bousai.go.jp/kunren2005/0901/top.html) [ja]. During this week
schools, organizations, offices and so on come together to organize disaster
prevention training.  
Severe earthquakes, inundations, fires and other types of disasters are
simulated and every citizen is required to participate.

In a country where [every year there are approximately 100,000 earthquakes
](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070424i1.html ) (including many
that human beings cannot perceive), everybody lives their life being aware
that a calamity could happen anywhere at anytime and they need to know how to
deal with it in the quickest and most effective way.

>  県の防災ヘリも参加して、被災者を吊り上げて搬送する訓練も見せていただきました。

In my town, every ward was organized into a disaster prevention group and
participated in several activities starting from early morning.  
Among those groups there were those who learnt how to erect a tent and those
who were trained to fight a fire.  
As I belong to the Red Cross, together with my colleagues we held courses
teaching people how to manage a `Disaster Prevention Volunteer Center`. The
firemen of the town also participated with enthusiasm. A session to teach what
to do in case of building collapse was set up and rescue dogs were trained to
look for victims.  
The firemen’s team also simulated the rescue of people trapped in collapsed
houses. The emergency helicopter of the prefecture took part in the training
as well and showed us how to lift and carry injured persons.

A blogger living in Shizuoka Prefecture (south of Tokyo) [ explains what he
learnt ]( http://www2.cocolog-
suruga.com/chunenpower/2009/08/post-738b.html　)this year.

> 8月 11日に静岡県を襲った 震度 6弱の地震。その地震で、あらためて災害に備えることの大切さを知りました。  
>  そして、先週から、「県の防災週間」がはじまり、静岡県内の各地で、巨大地震 (震度 7以上) を想定した防災訓練が行われています。

On the 11th of August a tremor with an intensity [ ***** ] of less than 6
struck Shizuoka Prefecture. This made me once again realize the importance of
preparing for  
such disasters.  
Last week the “Prefectural Week of Disaster Prevention” started and in every
area of Shizuoka Prefecture training for the prevention against a possible
severe earthquake (intensity of 7 or more) was held.

> 今年度の町内会の組長である小生は、「簡易担架の作り方」コーナー担当でした。毛布とかシーツを使って、カンタンに怪我人などを運ぶ方法を学びました。  
>  ほかにも、防災倉庫に常備されている チェーンソウ、発電機、消化ポンプの使い方。三角巾などを使った怪我人の手当ての方法も学びました。  
>  今年からは、簡易トイレも購入して、その作り方も学びました。

I am the chairman of my town assembly this year and I was assigned to the `how
to make a simple stretcher` session and I learnt how to swiftly carry injured
people, using blankets and sheets.  
I learnt how to use chainsaws, electricity generators and portable pumps, that
are always present in the disaster prevention kits, and also how to give
medical treatment to an injured person including the use of a triangular
bandage.  
This year, we also purchased a portable toilet and learned how to set it up.

[ ***** ] The [Japanese scale](http://www.mutantfrog.com/2009/08/12/the-
japanese-earthquake-scale/) is different from the Richter scale. One measures
the seismic intensity, the other measures the magnitude of an earthquake.
