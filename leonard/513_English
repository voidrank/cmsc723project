Since the artillery attack by North Korea last week on the populated South
Korean island of Yeonpyeong, which killed four people and turned the island
into a ghost town, offers of help for the desperate islanders have come
pouring in from everywhere in South Korea.

After the shelling by North Korea devastated Yeonpyeong island, most of its
residents fled to Incheon, the nearest city, leaving their homes behind.
Luckily, around 1,300 residents who were rendered homeless were given a
helping hand. Currently, about 800 Yeonpyeong refugees are staying in Inspa
World, one of Incheon's finest spa facilities, thanks to the generosity of its
owner, Park Un-gyu. Park has generously lodged and fed the refugees, at his
own expense with no strings attached, for over a week. Local newspapers
estimate the cost of hosting the refugees to be around 100 million Won
(US$88,000). Though donations have been offered to those in need and numerous
volunteers and aid groups have shown up in the area to assist, Korean citizens
are displeased with the city government's lukewarm response. While Park
struggled to host the refugees all by himself, the Incheon city government
merely promised that they would reimburse him later for his expense.

According to local media reports, an hour after hearing the news of the deadly
skirmish, Park picked up the phone and called the Incheon city government and
offered to host the refugees at his facility. Inspa World, a gigantic complex
offering a variety of spa treatments, is quite a lucrative business, receiving
around 3,000 customers daily on weekends. In order to be able to accommodate
the refugees, Park turned away paying customers and even hired extra staff.
[It was revealed later by local
media[ko]](http://faas7777.blog.me/40118613587) that Park had also opened his
doors, also free of charge, to members of the coast guard and volunteers who
came to the city to handle the aftermath of the [Cheonan
incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROKS_Cheonan_sinking), which killed 46
South Korean marines.

Twitter user
[@barunsori6](https://twitter.com/barunsori6/status/10174485286096897), who
works in the media, posted an exclusive [interview with
Park[ko].](http://tvpot.daum.net/clip/ClipView.do?clipid=28741882) In the
interview Park said that even though he was delighted to host the refugees, it
had been more than eight days and the burden had become a bit overwhelming.
_Barunsori_ has initiated the first-ever tweet donation concert to help the
Yeonpyeong refugees. Though the concert is not until December 14, donations
reached almost 8 million Korean Won (US$7,000) in just three days, and several
top singers and celebrities, including South Korean rock legend Kim Jong-suh,
have pledged to show up at the event. _Barunsori_

[One medical community went to Inspa World to do medical volunteer
work](http://kimgilwoo.tistory.com). Kim Gil-woo posted [an article with
pictures titled ](http://kimgilwoo.tistory.com/284)“In Incheon Inspa World,
Doctor Kwon Tae-wook and Doctor Lee Dae-hyun have cured 66 seniors in our
first round [of volunteer trips to the location]”. The writer of the article,

[in front of Inspa World] It was bustling with cars parked outside. As we
entered the main gate, we saw various relief aids scattered around here and
there. As I entered, I was faced with Yeonpyeong islanders who sat there so
uncomfortably in such a crowded place. I was suddenly overcome by a strong
emotion.

When we opened our (makeshift) medical clinic, people who had been living over
a week in discomfort lined up and started to be registered. After tending to
them one by one, two hours passed very quickly and the it was a lunch time. We
lunch on food that people from various places had donated. […] The treatment
continued and it was past 4:30pm and we had attended to 66 patients. I felt
happiness about the fact that I have helped these people somehow, but also
felt gloomy at the thought that they have lost their home and livelihoods and
were staying at the spa.

Many Koreans have expressed gratitude to Inspa World's Park for being
extremely generous in time of emergency and for confirming that warm hearts
still exist in Korean society.
