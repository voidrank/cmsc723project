On Sept. 1, a silence decree came into force in Budapest's District VI, which
is well-known for its lively nightlife. The decree requires bars, restaurants
and 24-hour-shops to close at 10 PM. The local council promised to review the
regulation on Sept. 10 and keep further arrangements suspended, but the notary
of District VI with a group of policemen started a round-up on Sept. 1 and
made several bars and restaurants dismiss their guests and close their doors
in Nagymező Street, which is also known as the Broadway of Pest.

The first civil disobedience movement and protest against the decree took
place the same day at Liszt Ferenc Square, András Földes of _index.hu_

(HUN):

> […] The demonstration of the outlets in Terézváros [‘Theresa City’ is the
> other name of District VI] Thursday night succeeded wonderfully. Protesting
> against the decree of the district, which came into force Sept. 1, the
> outlets at Liszt Ferenc Square turned off their lamps at 10 PM. Foreigners
> sitting on the terraces looked around wonderingly, as if they were waiting
> to get to know some special Hungarian habit. The citizens from Budapest were
> undisturbed, they kept on talking.
>
> It became obvious that they knew what was happening when the lamps turned
> back on and a wave of applause swept over the terraces. The square again
> looked as if the decree of District VI hadn't come into force that day,
> saying that the outlets of entertainment, restaurants and shops were allowed
> to be open until 10 in the evening instead of midnight and 1 AM. […]

_The Budapest Times_ published an
[article](http://www.budapesttimes.hu/content/view/12949/27/) after the
revision of the decree, reporting:

> Despite having promised a suspension of the silence decree on bars and
> restaurants, the council of Budapest’s District VI voted against the
> discontinuation of the regulation at its session last Thursday. […] After
> the decision was announced around 50 district bar owners held a meeting and
> unanimously agreed to stay open after 10pm. […] They will likely close at
> 1pm, which, according to the decree, was previously the latest time a bar or
> a restaurant could remain open if no resident complaints were made against
> it.

The citizens started to organize a demonstration in front of the district's
mayor's office on

ENG):

> We had no other choice but to DEMONSTRATE against the so-called “silence
> order” came into force on the 1st of September, according to which ALL PUBS
> AND RESTAURANTS have to close the latest at 1 a.m. in district VI
> (Terézváros).
>
> Unfortunately it turned out that quite a few members of the delegate board
> simply did not say the truth upon promising the withdrawal of the order came
> into force on the 1st of September. Now we’ve been assured by the
> renegotiation of the issue at the end of October, expectedly it will amount
> to the same result. So far negotiations and protests were not efficient, so
> our only way is a demonstration.
>
> Noone has the right to paralyse the nightlife of downtown Budapest, to
> bankrupt well-known and popular pubs, to restrain the vivid clublife.
> Budapest is a real European metropolis which can not exist without night
> life!
>
> More than a 1000 workplaces, yearly hundreds of thousands guests and the
> fame, renown of Budapest are at stake!
>
> Would you like to party in the future in Terézváros? Than demonstrate with
> us! Without YOU it won't work. The more people are there the more evident it
> will be how ridiculous and destroying this order is.
>
> The venue of evening parties is downtown Budapest, noone can take it away!
> […]

A website was started dealing with the topic, trying to reconcile the views of
the local residents who want silence and rest at night and of those who prefer
keeping the boisterous nightlife alive.
[Takarodó.com](http://www.takarodo.com/) (‘sack time’.com, HUN) published
several ideas and proposals that they would like to discuss with the local
council. They're also spreading the word and try to invite people to the
demonstration on Monday.
