Iranian protesters
[poured](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/12/27/iran.protests/) into
Tehran and several major cities in defiance of the Iranian government on
Sunday, as large crowds gathered for Ashura, a major religious observance.

The crowds fought back security forces and chanted slogans against the Islamic
regime. According to one opposition web site, at least four people were
killed. While Iranian and international reporters were banned from the event,
citizen media provided photos and video coverage.
