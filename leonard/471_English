A U.S.-based Serbian couple Vuk and Verica Nastic have been going through hell
since June 2010, when the U.S. Child Protection Agency (CPA) took away their
children, son Damjan, 8, and daughter Nastasija, 5, because of alleged
negligence and sexual abuse.

According to the Serbian [media
reports](http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/144645/Amerikanci+nam+oteli+decu%21.html),
the drama began when pictures of Vuk's naked children were found on his
laptop, after which the police and CPA representatives burst into Nastic’s
house in California. They handcuffed Vuk and Verica and took them to prison,
while the children were sent to live with a Mexican and, later, an Arab foster
family.

Eventually, Vuk Nastic was released on $18,000 bail; his wife was released six
days later.

According to a statement issued by the Nastic family, it had been little
Damjan who took the photos while playing with the camera, while his parents
were downstairs.

On Sept. 1, the Nastic family's attorneys and the CPA signed a deal, according
to which the Nastics were guilty of negligence (because they allowed their
children to use the camera), while the other charges were eliminated.

The Nastics have engaged a team of Serbian psychologists, who sent a letter to
the California court explaining cultural differences between Serbia and the
United States: “In our culture children are perceived as completely asexual
and it isn’t unusual that they take baths with their parents. It is nothing
unusual that they are photographed and I believe that everyone has in their
family album their own naked photo (as a child), or their child’s. It does not
produce any erotic feeling, they are just perceived as little kids.”

Nastic family”](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Podrska-Porodici-Nastic-
Support-to-Nastic-Family/186523644693492) call people to post their own naked
childhood pictures as a way of public defiance. Some have posted photos of
their own children.

She also posted [a mock

about a YouTube video of two American children who were recorded in a bathtub.

an experience similar to that of the Nastic family:

Mira Popovic-Keser was [not
surprised](http://www.facebook.com/#!/permalink.php?story_fbid=187859771226546&id=1827996527)
by the story, but she could not hide her own bad feelings:

After six months of silence, the Serbian highest authorities did indeed get
involved.

The Serbian President Boris Tadic [personally
engaged](http://www.trojka.rs/vesti/4649-tadic-naredio-u-pomoc-nasticima.html)
in solving this problem, treating it as a problem of the highest diplomatic
level. Vuk Nastic wrote [a letter of gratitude](http://www.vesti-
online.com/Vesti/Srbija/106697/Vuk-Nastic-poslao-pismo-Tadicu) to the
President.

At the same time, people who think that photographing naked children should
not be called culture and tradition also reacted.
