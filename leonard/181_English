The Roma in the Republic of Macedonia (RM) have political representation,
including [a Member of Parliament, a
Mayor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_%28Romani_subgroup%29#Macedonia), and
a [Government Minister](http://www.vlada.mk/?q=node/3155). Their legal and
ethnic rights are institutionally protected, and the media do not use ethnic
slurs. However, most of the Roma suffer the oppression of poverty, compounded
with the consequences of negative stereotyping based on skin color and
perpetuation of traditional prejudices by their fellow-citizens.

Over the years, NGOs have reacted to cases of discrimination, such as denial
of entry to Roma children in public pools, or police brutality toward the
Roma, which usually remain without official closure. Ethnic Macedonian
bloggers also tackle this issue from time to time. For instance, in 2009 _Bi_
[wrote](http://blogot.blog.com.mk/node/240027) [mk] about a “shameful” protest
against building of a center for street children on the premises of a
kindergarten in [Bitola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitola). In 2010, Global
Voices covered [the incident involving the use of overwhelming police
force](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/07/macedonia-police-raid-roma-
riot/) in a Roma-majority Skopje suburb of [Šuto
Orizari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0uto_Orizari_Municipality) (aka
Šutka).

* The discrepancy between census results and the “actual” estimated numbers may stem from the cases of people who adopt the identity of a larger, more powerful ethnic group, allegedly due to hope that it would provide them material or other benefits. This affects various ethnic groups, leading to controversies about the “true” identity of portions of the population in various combinations: Roma “turned” into Turks or Albanians, Muslim ethnic Macedonians or Albanians “turned” into Turks, Christian Macedonians “turned” into Bulgarians… On the other hand, representatives of the small ethnic Egyptian community vehemently deny any relation to the more numerous Roma. The state's response on such issues is that all citizens have the right to self-determination in regard to ethnic identity and nobody should influence their choices.
