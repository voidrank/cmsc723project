Media artist Kazuhiko Hachiya (八谷和彦) realized an [animated
video](http://www.youtube.com/user/onaradaijobu) to explain the situation at
the nuclear plant of Fukushima.

The main character is Genpatsu-kun (i.e. Mr. Nuclear power station ) who has a
stomach ache caused by the earthquake. Doctors (i.e. nuclear experts) go and
cure him with cold water and boric acid to prevent him to “poo” (i.e. to
release radiations). At the moment, Genpatsu-kun's stomach ache doesn't stop
but his health condition is constantly monitored and so far, only repeated
“poopees” (i.e. smoke emissions) have been reported.

The anime also explains how, even in the worst scenario, Mr. Genpatsu (i.e.
Fukushima plant) is different from Mr. Chernobyl, as he is wearing a nappy.
However, in case Mr. Genpatsu had to poo (i.e. the nuclear plant exploded),
the effects on the health of the people living in the area would be very
serious for decades.
