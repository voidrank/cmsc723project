On January 17, 2010 Sebastián Piñera was elected Chile's next president,
following twenty years of a left-leaning government that symbolized the
transition to democracy after [Augusto
Pinochet’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet) dictatorship.
Spanish-speaking bloggers and online newspapers have commented on the
relationship between the president-elect and the deceased dictator; many of
these observations arose from the public support showed to Pinochet after
Piñera’s victory.

Commenting on the Pinochet followers the day of the final vote, [Luis Ramirez
[es]](blog: http://luisramirez.cl/blog/?p=2785) wrote on his blog:

> Sí, ya es un hecho: Los Piñeristas Pinochetistas están entre nosotros.

Yes, it is a fact: The Piñeristas Pinochetistas (Pinochet supporters) are
among us.

Pictures like the one above and videos like the one below that show Chileans
yelling “General Pinochet, this victory is for you” and “Chi Chi Chi le le le,
long live Chile and Pinochet” have been passed around the internet to the
bewilderment of some, and the indifference of others who say that this is
nothing new in the country.
