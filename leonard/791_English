Russia has experienced an enormous growth of Internet penetration during the
last 10 years. But the quality of Internet connection isn't the same for
everyone. Quality, price and accessibility of the broadband Internet differ a
lot throughout the country with some territories (like
[Sakhalin](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/03/07/russia-divide/) [EN])
still being beyond the digital divide. In this article, I'll present the
results of the study of broadband prices of the Internet in the Russia's 90
largest cities (with the exception of Moscow and Saint Petersburg). The study
was conducted as a part of my Ph.D. thesis for the Moscow State University.
More detailed version will be published in the Russian magazine “[Internet v
Cyfrah](http://www.in-numbers.ru/)” [RUS] in April, 2010.

The analysis focused on unlimited Internet access at the speed of 1 megabit
per second (mbs). The original dataset included 810 providers. Then the city
median mean was counted. The result of the analysis showed that Russians pay
for the same service very different prices. 1mbs unlimited Internet access
plan costs from $180 per month in northern
[Norilsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk) [EN] to $12 in [Yoshkar-
Ola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshkar-Ola) [EN] in central Russia. In some
cities, there are no 1mb unlimited plans at all and the highest speed people
can count on is 256 kbs (if this happened, the special coefficient was used).

Another problem is that in many towns in Siberia and Far East there's no
decent broadband and people use satelite Internet which is much more
expensive. Below is the table of the cities with the cheapest and the most
expensive Internet in the country:

**Table 1. Cities with the cheapest broadband prices (November 2009)**

($ per month) | Number of providers  
---|---|---|---

2 | [Kazan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan) | 14 | 13

10 | [Penza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penza) | 17 | 10  
  
Most of the cities in the top-10 are from the [Volga
region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Federal_District) (Yoshkar-Ola,
[Naberezhnye Chelny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naberezhnye_Chelny) [EN],
[Kazan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan) [EN] and others) where the
cheapest prices were found. As a general rule, the cheapest Internet is
prevalent in the biggest cities with developed universities (Yekaterinburg,
Novosibirsk and others). The railroad connection is also of critical
importance due to the technology of the construction of the broadband
telecommunications, many of which are constructed along with the railroads.

On the other side, the most expensive broadband can be found in two types of
cities: industrial and/or [company
towns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_town) [EN] and in the cities of
the North Caucasus. People of the cities with developed oil industry (Surgut
and Nizhnevartvosk) do not usually “suffer” from high Internet prices due to
higher than average salaries. Both types of cities represent the “risk groups”
where the digital divide is present. Poor infrastructure tied with low
salaries turns into backwardness on a digital level.

Different prices of broadband in the cities lead to a serious differentiation
on a regional level. Below is the map of the broadband prices in different
[Federal Districts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_districts_of_Russia)
[EN] (super-regional administration territorial divisions).

While in the [Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Federal_District),
[Volga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Federal_District) and
[Urals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urals_Federal_District) federal districts
the situation with the Internet is rather normal (about $30 for broadband,
which is about 5-7 percent of the average income in 2007 and even less in
2009), the situation is much worse in the Far East and North Caucasus where
Internet is not only expensive but also less accessible.

Role of government in promoting broadband is positive but not everywhere.
Government companies (Center – [Domolink](http://www.domolink.ru/), North-West
– [Avangard](http://www.avangard-dsl.ru/), Volga –
[JDSL](http://www.jdsl.ru/), N.Caucasus – [Disel](http://www.diselcom.ru/),
Urals – [Utel](http://www.u-tel.ru/), Siberia – [Web
Stream](http://www.wstream.ru/), Far East – [Disly](http://www.disly.dsv.ru/))
that work in federal districts usually offer the lowest prices and the best
conditions. At the same time, in the “problematic” regions like Far East and
North Caucasus, government ISP often face monopoly accusations (like it
happened with [Dal Svyaz](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/03/07/russia-
divide/)). At the same time, government ISPs are expected to be more likely to
violate users’ rights and less eager to stick to Net Neutrality principles.

Another dimension of digital divide is the size of the city. The analysis
shows that the bigger city is the better conditions users have. Internet in
smaller cities is usually more expensive and there is less provider competion.

**Table 3. Share of broadband price in relation to the average salary**

City inhabitants | Share of broadband price in the average salary  
---|---  
1,000,000 + | 3,6%  
500,000 – 1,000,000 | 5,2%  
400,000 – 500,000 | 5,6%  
300,000 – 400,000 | 7,4%  
200,000 – 300,000 | 8,8%  
  
Although Internet penetration rate growth in Russia is impressive, more
detailed picture shows there's a lot to be done. As in other parts of the
world, there are several factors influencing digital divide: location near
main telecommunications arterias, size of the city and it's specialization.

Soviet-era industrial company towns turn out to be less competitive in the
post-industrial era. Cities of the unstable and underdeveloped North Caucasus
experience the lack of both telecommunications investment and provider
competition. Majority of population in smaller cities and towns might have
passed the digital divide but still live in the “pre-broadband” world with
little or no access to YouTube and other traffic-sensitive online services.

While government officials in the United States and European Union raise the
question of the country-wide affordable 30 mbs (or even 100 mbs) in the next
decades, Russia's aim should be at least 1 megabit per second.
