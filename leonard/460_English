This past week, a 28-year-old pop singer known as Kalimba was [accused of rape
by two underage girls.](http://perezhilton.com/2011-01-01-mexican-pop-singer-
kalimba-accused-of-raping-two-underage-girls)

The girls were hired for a one-night event at a bar as models. They decided
not to charge any money for their work as they felt it was good enough to be
in the same event as the famous singer. After the event, the girls went to the
singer's hotel, where the alleged rape took place.

In Mexico, to have sex with a minor is punishable by law.

The next day, the girls went back to the airport with the singer.

Mexicans following the story are divided in their opinions: Some believe that
the girls are taking advantage of the singer in order to get fame and monetary
benefits; others think the girls where just victims of a famous singer who
thinks he can have whatever he wants.

[Kalimba's](http://twitter.com/KalimbaMX) (@KalimbaMX) recent tweets mention
his prayers and his faith and loyalty to God:

> Independientemente de lo que pase, gracias a todos lo que creen en la
> verdad. DIOS los bendiga. Seamos fuertes en oracion. Be blessed.

[Whatever happens, thanks to all who believe in the truth.
](http://twitter.com/#!/KalimbaMX/status/22118342307348480)God bless you.
Let's be strong in prayer. Be blessed.

> Es gran error humano creer que DIOS te abndona en los problemas y nos deja
> solos. No es hipocrecia, es fe! Conozco a mi DIOS. Be blessed

A big human error is to believe that God leaves you while you are facing
problems and that you are alone. It is not hypocrisy, it is faith! I know my
God. Be blessed

His fans have also defended him through Twitter, like Monserrat Sotelo
([@BarbieMonse](http://twitter.com/BarbieMonse/statuses/26322752369594368))
[es] and Kenya Alvarez
([@Jeiimyy](http://twitter.com/Jeiimyy/statuses/26312816508014593)):

> kalimba stamos contigo animo amigo hechale ganas ya sabes q estas 2chicas
> solo kieren hacer pedazos tu vida y tu carrera tqm ….

kalimba we are with you, be strong friend, you know that those two girls just
want to ruin your life and your career. I love you…

Other Twitter users are disappointed that the case is getting so much media
and public attention. Ce
([@csita22](http://twitter.com/csita22/status/26305454296539136)) tweets:

> Entre si soy acuario o no, y si kalimba es culpable o no, casi me distraigo
> de lo realmente importante… Que voy a hacer por mi pais hoy??

Wondering weather I am [Aquarius ](http://www.aolnews.com/2011/01/13/new-
zodiac-sign-dates-causing-identity-crisis-on-twitter/)or not, and if Kalimba
is guilty or not, I almost got distracted from what is really important… What
can I do for my country today??

In a similar tone, El Silenciero
([@ElSilenciero](http://twitter.com/ElSilenciero/status/26137121240645632))
[es] condemns that the media is reporting more on Kalimba's case than on [the
murder of poet and activist Susana
Chavez.](http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7870273-mexican-activist-
susana-chavez-who-led-protests-against-unsolved-killings-in-juarez-is-
murdered)

The blog [_Hazme el Chingado Favor_
compared](http://hazmeelchingadofavor.com/index.php/2011/01/11/kalimba-
envaselinado/) [es] the whole situation to a soap opera:

> La _telenovela nacional_ esta dominada últimamente por [la historia de
> Kalimba que es acusado de
> violar](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/102095.html) a dos
> menores de edad. Sobra decir que para este tipo de noticias nos pintamos
> solos con chistes

The _national soap opera_ is dominated with Kalimba's story, accused to have
raped two underage girls. Needless to say, for this type of news we are able
to invent hundreds of jokes.

Finally, Félix Rivera in the column “Sexo Ilícito” (Illicit Sex) at
_Vanguardia_ , [expressed his concern about the
news](http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/sexoilicito-627983-columna.html) [es],
inviting Mexican society to judge this case in a fair way:

> En todo caso, Kalimba no se ha cansado de declararse inocente. Y aunque el
> público prefiera la “versión picante” en la que todos se lo imaginan
> sosteniendo relaciones sexuales con dos muchachas ebrias, también cabe la
> posibilidad de que efectivamente no haya sucedido nada. En todo caso, lo más
> importante es que esta situación se resuelva con justicia y que si de todos
> modos alguien resulta culpable, se pague el delito conforme a la ley.

In any case, Kalimba has not given up and he has always said he is not guilty.
And while the public prefers the “spicy version” in which they all imagine him
having sex with two drunk girls, it is also possible that actually nothing has
happened. In any case, the most important thing is that this situation will be
resolved with justice and that if someone is guilty, he/she pays the offense
under the law.

Kalimba denies having sexually abused both minors. If the singer is found
guilty by Mexican authorities, he will be sentenced to prison.
