A plane flight safety demonstration danced to pop tunes by the flight
attendants of a Philippine-based commercial airline is a recent a hit on
YouTube.

According to an [airline
official](http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2010/10042010.html), the
dancing of the safety procedure demonstration is simply one way of combining
service and entertainment.

> “The safety demo dance rendition is just another way to bring out our fun
> culture and showcase our homegrown talents. We plan to roll this out onto
> more flights after receiving great commendations from the global public.”

Cebu Pacific is a budget carrier in the Philippines which dominates the local
airline industry.

An association of flight attendants and stewards, however, is
[alarmed](http://www.facebook.com/notes/anc-247/press-statement-fasap-is-
against-dancing-flight-attendants-gimmick/471576039121) by the gimmick and the
spread of the video on the net.

As of this writing, the video already have 6,866,006 views, 13,720 likes, and
529 dislikes since its uploading on September 30. It also attained [a variety
of YouTube honors](http://www.techpinas.com/2010/10/cebu-pacific-dancing-
flight-attendants.html), according to _Techpinas_.

The video has elicited both positive and negative comments in Youtube,
Facebook, and Twitter. Many lauded the dancing flight attendants for making
safety demos less boring. The video's detractors, however, condemn the
practice for espousing sexism and gender discrimination. A sample of some
comments on Facebook:

> **Samuel Raterta** i like it. passengers became more attentive to the safety
> features of the aircraft. also they only danced at the start not the whole
> flight.  
>  **Prince Valdez** lets face it sex sells…  
>  **Tine Sabillo** Sex sells because we tolerate such cheap sexist marketing
> schemes. And yes, there are a lot of not-so-young PAL FAs. They've been
> fighting for equality. They are safety professionals after all. This is not
> some beauty or talent contest. People will still ride airplanes even if the
> FAs aren't that “hot” or “pretty” because travel is a necessity. No to
> gender and age discrimination at work.  
>  **Mabel Balanquit** what the fuss about it. its a nice strategy. its

>  **Rey Refran** ‎”throwback to the unenlightened past during the 50s and 60s
