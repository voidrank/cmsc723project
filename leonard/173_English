On Thursday May 5, 2011, a national protest (#marchanacional on Twitter)
kicked off in
[Cuernavaca](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110505/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_mexico_anti_violence_march),
Morelos, a city 80 kilometers (around 50 miles) away from Mexico City. The
participants en route to the capital in a peaceful walk will be received on
Sunday, May 8, with [a massive peaceful
demonstration](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/05/mexico-prepares-for-
massive-national-protest-on-may-8/) against the violence generated by the War
on Drugs.

On Wednesday night, hours before the march began, President [Felipe
Calderón](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_calderon) appeared on national
television [ asking for the support and understanding from Mexican
society](http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/world/05/05/11/mexico-
defends-drug-crackdown-ahead-protest  ) towards his strategy in combating drug
trafficking.

> Your understanding and your support, support from the entire society, is
> essential. Because some people, in good or bad faith, are trying to stop the

>
> There is no option to withdraw from the fight. On the contrary, we must
> redouble our efforts, because if we stop fighting they will kidnap, rob and
> kill all over the country.

During the official acts of the Cinco de Mayo national holiday, the President[
declared](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2011/05/05/tengo-la-razon-la-ley-
y-la-fuerza-tropas-seguiran-en-lucha-contra-delincuencia-calderon) [es]:

> Ante este enemigo hay quienes, de buena o mala fe, quisieran ver a nuestras
> tropas retroceder, a las instituciones bajar la guardia y darle simple y
> llanamente el paso a gavillas de criminales. Yo les digo que eso no puede y
> no va a ocurrir, porque tenemos la razón, porque tenemos la ley, y porque
> tenemos la fuerza vamos a ganar.

In the face of this enemy there are some that – with good or bad will, would
like to see our troops stepping back, institutions lowering their guard and
simply give way to sheaves of criminals. I tell all of them that this cannot
happen, because we are right, because we have the law, and because we have the
strength to win.

Monero Hernández (@[monerohernandez](http://twitter.com/#!/monerohernandez)),
a political cartoonist that organized the movement #nomassangre (#nomoreblood)
published this cartoon criticizing the President for not listening to the
protestor's demands.

Hundreds of people are already on their way to Mexico City. Excited, fearless
and marching in silence, the participants demand a credible and smart strategy
from the government, one that won't result in more violence and deaths.

Samuel Espino ([@Sarcle](https://twitter.com/#!/roblesmaloof)), a very active
citizen that has been working really hard in the organization and promotion of
this protest, was also featured today in Al Jazeera's[ “The
Stream”](http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/mexico-may8) to talk about
#marchanacional.

Newspaper _Milenio_[ offers an interactive map
](http://www.milenio.com/node/710119)[es] of the route and events related to
#marchanacional. The group that left Cuernavaca on the morning of May 5
already covered the first 20 kilometers (around 12 miles). Here is a video of
their arrival to Coajumulco, their first stop:

[@patyaspe](https://twitter.com/#!/patyaspe/status/66239447607422976) tweets:

> La marcha retoma su camino. Son más de mil personas, entre víctimas,
> familiares, inconformes y reporteros… Ah, y policías #marchanacional

The march is back on track. Over one thousand people, including victims,
families, protesters and reporters … Oh, and police #marchanacional

Also, a music video by Youth in Movement United for Peace from
[Chiapas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas) is spreading around the web to
support #marchanacional and demand: “No more Blood, No more Deaths Mr
President!”

Jesús Robles Maloof also writes in [his
blog](https://roblesmaloof.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/marcha-nacional-dia-1/)
[es] about the first day of #marchanacional:

> Nunca pensé que caminaría de Cuernavaca al DF, como nunca pensé que mi país
> se sumiera en una ola de violencia y que nuestros políticos solo acertarán a
> decir. “Si no estas conmigo, estás contra mi”. Sigue el debate de las
> propuestas de las ideas. ¿se debe cambiar la estrategia? ¿cuál es la opción?
> ¿marchar resuelve algo?

I never thought I'd walk from Cuernavaca to Mexico City, as I never thought
that my country was going to be plunged into a wave of violence and that our
politicians would managed to say. “If you're not with me, you're against me. ”
The debate of proposals and ideas continue. Is there a need to change the
strategy? What are the options? Does marching solve anything?

Today, May 6, the march will continue all the way to Topilejo on the southern
outskirts of Mexico City and more people are expected to join to get to the
main square, [El Zócalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Zocalo), in downtown
Mexico City on May 8.
