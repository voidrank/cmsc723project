Russia Time by Wikimedia Commons

A year ago Russian President Dmitry Medvedev brought up the idea of changing
time zones in the regions of Russia. In his annual address to the Federal
Assembly of the Russian Federation he particularly
[stated](http://www.rg.ru/2009/11/13/poslanie.html) [RUS] that by doing so a
convenient co-existence of different regions and the capital would be
achieved. Messages on this topic sprung up on news portals of Primorsky Krai
several days ago.

In the meantime this is not entirely a novel idea. A year ago Gennadiy
Lazarev, a member of the regional Legislative Assembly, provoked the same sort
of discussion on the web. He suggested changing the time zone with the
expectation of reducing the difference with Moscow from seven to four hours.
These ideas did not get very far and nothing was changed. User
_NNN_[argued](http://novostivl.ru/msg/9251.htm) [RUS] that the [protests of
December 2008 – January
2009](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B5_\(2008%E2%80%942010\))
[RUS] in Vladivostok became the reason for this proposal. The people went on
the streets [with Japanese flags](http://pioneer-
lj.livejournal.com/1225290.html) [RUS] protesting against the ban on the
right-sided steering wheel. When it all happened Moscow was still asleep and
the governmental reaction was late.

On 17 November 2010, members of the Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai
will discuss an initiative to change the time zone of the region, thus making
it one hour closer to Moscow. It is particularly planned to prepare a proposal
for Vladimir Putin, Russian Prime Minister.

As news portal _VL.ru_
[reported](http://news.vl.ru/vlad/2010/11/13/priblizitsja/) [RUS], regional
Governor[Sergey
Darkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Mikhaylovich_Darkin) [RUS] became
an initiator of this idea. In the meantime netizens of Primorsky Krai were
highly concerned about this decision as well as the fact that public opinion
has been neglected.

_Drom.ru_ , Far East automobile portal, became a useful platform for netizens
not only to discuss the car-related issues but social and political ones as
well. Global Voices has
[written](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/25/russia-online-activism-
success-stories/) about one of its successful campaigns.

This time _Drom_ community did not ignore the issue of changing time zones
either. User _Jokky_ particularly [pointed
out](http://forums.drom.ru/vladivostok/t1151482563.html) [RUS] that the
session of the Legislative Assembly would not take place in the usual location
where everyone could come, but in a small room on the eighth floor where the
public would not be allowed. In the meantime the official website of the
Legislative Assembly
[refuted](http://www.zspk.gov.ru/activity/sessions/90.html) [RUS] the
information, announcing that the session would take place in the assembly hall
open for everyone. Other users suggested canceling winter or making the day
longer since the Moscow decision-makers are all-mighty and local politicians
are following their every move.

Information agency _Deita.ru_
[mentioned](http://www.deita.ru/politics/primorskij-
kraj_11.11.2010_158423_primorskie-chinovniki-zakonodatelno-khotjat-stat-
blizhe-k-moskve.html) various advantages of this initiative. It would be
comfortable for those doing shopping in bordering China. The time difference
with this country and Primorsky Krai is three hours in Summer and two in
Winter. China has only one time-zone and _Deita.ru_ has expressed suspicion
that soon the region will minimize its time difference with Moscow to four
hours instead of the existing seven-hour difference. They suggest that the
Chinese are not complaining and it would be much easier for the Kremlin to
rule the country with this improvement.

I am a representative of officialdom, and not for the first year. I must say
that the (Vladivostok's – GV) interaction with the center (Moscow – GV) only
slightly correlates with the difference in time. Not often, but it happens
sometimes, we get instructions from the center in the morning which were
supposed to be executed the evening or night before. But it happens so rarely
that it cannot significantly disrupt the overall work. On the other hand, if
the center really needs it, then they will always find and pull in to work any
bureaucrat, wherever he is, but at my work I can recall only one such case in
10 years. So, in my opinion the problem of time zones is completely
artificially inflated.

Indeed, many local companies adapt to the Moscow time zone and stay extra
hours at work. It has not been a big problem before, even during the time of
the Soviet Union. User _Ученик 5 класса_ [5th grade student]
[claimed](http://www.deita.ru/politics/primorskij-
kraj_11.11.2010_158423_primorskie-chinovniki-zakonodatelno-khotjat-stat-
blizhe-k-moskve.html)[RUS] that all officials have failed geography at school
and think that the earth is still flat. He suggested determining noon time by
the sun and live by daylight time, like ancient people did.

Damn, it would be funny if it were not so sad! Are we really a country of
idiots? ? ? No, I don't consider everyone to be so, but the initiators of such
ideas and their supporters clearly have something wrong with their heads. It
is not convenient to work with Moscow – then move your working day for a
couple of hours. Why should everyone suffer? […] during the summer it was
possible to make it to the beach after work, and now [… ] one has to work and
then rush home before it gets dark. Why are MPs not guided by the logic and
requests of the public (they are sort of “people's representatives”), but not
the mercantile interests of the officials?

Probably these questions will be left unanswered. The [online
petition](http://petition.su/node/23) [RUS] against this measure has received
more than 250 signatures so far. Nevertheless this amount of signatures is not
enough, even though the activists are asking to hold a referendum regarding
the time zone change.
