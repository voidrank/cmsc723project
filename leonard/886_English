[Volens,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volens_\(NGO\)) a Belgian NGO works
with orphans and vulnerable children in Zimbabwe, counseling them on how they
can deal respectfully with giving and taking constructive criticism. Through
this process the children wrote, performed, filmed and edited a short movie
showing how gossip and badly given criticism could kill.

In the Chiedza Child Care Center in Waterfalls, Harare, fifteen children
between 12 and 18 years worked with the NGO learning about video making and
constructive criticism. They decided to[ film a mystery
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpikUywxQjk)in a reality TV situation, where
the characters face the death of one of the members of the Big Sistar house
they all live in. It seems she was poisoned, and they try to figure out who
had a motive to kill her, and they come face to face with the consequences of
gossip and destructive criticism.

At the [end of the movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpQUdFIRVs0), the
children all give tips and tricks on how to give constructive criticism in the
best way possible as well as how to receive it in good spirit.
