Egyptians from all walks of life have been chanting for an end of the Mubarak
regime, as Egypt braces itself for the 11th day of massive protests.

Today is being dubbed as Departure Friday or Final Friday, and millions are
being roused to march to the streets to bring down Mubarak's regime after the
noon Friday prayers. People are already in Tahrir Square, Cairo, and the
chants have never been louder.

The drama continues to unfold on our television screens and social media,
despite attempts by a desperate government to muzzle free voices around the
world. Yesterday saw unprecedented attacks by the government on political
activists, human rights defenders and the international media, drawing an
international outcry. In the dark of the night, we held our breath expecting
the worse from a regime which has shown us all that it would stoop to the
lowest most despicable levels to terrorise Egyptians calling for change and
aspiring to better lives. Stories of government-paid thugs wrecking havoc
continued to dominate our time lines, as the death toll and injuries continued
to pile up.

Back in Tahrir, the mood seems
[jubilant](http://streamarchive.us/videos/protesting-at-tahrir-square/#jan25),
with Mubarak's thugs at bay.

from the protests from YouTube:

> Translation via Adam:

> It's his daddy's money. Money does what it wants, While people became dirty
> poor, No to Mubarak No to Sulieman, To hell with tyranny. We want a civil
