According to Ecuador's latest census, more than 14 million people live in the
country, but there is still no consensus on the national infant mortality
rate. According to figures from UNICEF in 2009, the rate was 11 in 1,000, but
the [Index Mundi ](http://www.indexmundi.com/map/?v=29&r=xx&l=en)displays a
value of 20.9 per 1,000 live births.

Recent incidents have called attention to health care practices in neonatal
units in Ecuadorian public hospitals, triggering an investigation into newborn
deaths in the country.

**Health care gaps**

Although in the last decade funds for health care have increased in the state
budget from US $74.4 million to $1.244 million, not counting the $406 million
[granted](http://ecuadorinmediato.com/index.php?module=Noticias&func=news_user_view&id=145524&umt=LA%20HORA%20%28Quito%29%20%C1reas%20de%20neonatolog%EDa,%20vulnerables)
[es] after a health emergency was declared in Ecuador over the last three
months.

Newspaper [La
Hora](http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101108559/-1/%C3%81reas_de__neonatolog%C3%ADa,_vulnerables.html)
[es] explains why Ecuadorians worry about their newborns having to enter an
intensive care unit, especially in the light of complaints at hospitals in the
provinces of [Guayaquil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil), [Loja
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loja_Province)and [Santo Domingo de los
Táchilas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Domingo_de_Los_Colorados). These
are not the only hospitals with problems however; there are gaps in other
health care facilities, as the newspaper describes:

> La crisis en las áreas de Neonatologia no son de hoy, en los hospitales
> Napoleón Davila, de Chone, y Teófilo Davila, de Machala también se
> registraron muertes en años anteriores. En mayo de 2006, en Chone,
> fallecieron 26 neonatos. En Machala, en julio de 2005, un informe de la
> Direccion de Salud de El Oro señaló; la muerte de 89 recién nacidos.

The crisis in neonatal care is not new: Napoleon Davila hospital, Chone, and
Teofilo Davila hospital, Machala, also reported newborn deaths in previous
years. In May 2006, in Chone, 26 infants died. In Machala, in July 2005, a
report by the Directorate of Health of El Oro reported the death of 89
newborns.

So far, these cases are still under investigation. Ecuadorian Health Minister
[David Chiriboga](http://www.msp.gov.ec/) [es] and a High Level Technical
Committee are in charge of directing the enquiry.

For now only directors at the Gustavo Dominguez hospital and a provincial
director of health, both in the Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas province, have
been removed for a “[lack of
vision](http://neohegquito.blogspot.com/2011/03/diario-la-hora-18-de-marzo-
del-2011.html)” in their care for infants; [photos were
revealed](http://www.eldiario.com.ec/galeria-fotos/352-crisis-en-el-area-
neonatal-del-hospital-de-santo-domingo.html) of babies in the province being
placed in bathtubs and on cardboard sheets in the absence of any cribs, by
Guayaquil newspaper _El Universo_.

President Correa has [expressed doubts](http://ecuador.hotels-
vacations.in/news/correa-duda-de-veracidad-de-las-fotos-de-bebes-en-
cartones-77.html) [es] about the photos’ veracity, but Twitter users seem to
believe the images are real. Journalist Alexis Moncayo
([@alexismoncayo](http://twitter.com/#!/alexismoncayo/status/49147214542536704))
tweets that he cannot believe the show President Correa displays with the
newborns laying on cardboard.

But Daniela Pareja
([@Cuinita](http://twitter.com/#!/Cuinita/status/48555768290611200)) from
Guayaquil thinks it is the health minister's fault, not Correa's: “what a
beautiful country Ecuador is”, she tweets sarcastically.

Diosdado Anchundia
([@miramelindo35](http://twitter.com/#!/miramelindo35/status/49437027812392960))
says he now knows where his taxes are going: towards a “new piece of cardboard
on which newborns can stay warm”.

In the Loja province, reports have indicated that the bacterium [_Enterobacter
cloacae_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacter_cloacae) found in soap was
the possible cause of the 26 infant deaths[ registered at the Isidro Ayora
hospital since November
2010](http://ecuadorecuatoriano.blogspot.com/2011/03/neonatos-fallecidos-en-
hospital-isidro.html) [es]. In Francisco Icaza Bustamante hospital in
Guayaquil, the bacterium _[Serratia
marcescens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratia_marcescens) _has been the
reported cause of newborn deaths.

The vice minister of Public Health and the Isidro Ayora hospital's director
have [both resigned](http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/03/24/1/1447/reubicado-
personal-vinculado-mal-estado-hospitales.html?p=1354&m=1775) [es].

**Whose responsibility?**

But on Twitter, Ecuadorian journalist Mónica Mendoza
([@moniquemendoza](http://twitter.com/moniquemendoza)) is concerned about the
level of responsibilities:

>
> [@moniquemendoza](http://twitter.com/moniquemendoza/status/49125003542802434#):
> Por qué si [#Correa](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Correa "#Correa")
> responsabiliza al Ministerio de Salud por mala atención
> a[#neonatos](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23neonatos "#neonatos"), solo sale
> viceministra y no el ministro Chiriboga?

@moniquemendoza: If #Correa has issued responsibilities to his Health Minister
for the poor attention to #newborns, why it is only the Vice Minister who
leaves and not [Health] Minister Chiriboga?

_[MetroEcuador](http://www.metroecuador.com.ec/10729-plan-contra-infecciones-
para-salvar-a-neonatos.html)_ [es] reports current data on infant mortality:
“The rates of frequency of infection in neonatal units are between 15 and 30
percent. About 140 babies die each year in public hospitals in Ecuador.”

But both the Health Minister David Chiriboga and the Minister of Social
Development Coordination, Jeannette Sanchez, have [tried to defend
themselves](http://www.desarrollosocial.gob.ec/ Minister-jeannette-sanchez-
and-minister-david-Chiriboga-had-a-chat show-cum-leaders-of-
opinion-1216.html):

> En lo referente a la muerte de neonatos en diferentes ciudades del país,
> indicó que, a nivel mundial, se estima que entre el 5 y el 10 por ciento de
> pacientes ingresado a cualquier hospital adquiere infecciones
> intrahospitalarias. De este porcentaje, 25% ocurre en cuidados intensivos.
> Las infecciones neonatales son un problema global y no particular del
> Ecuador, presentes incluso en hospitales de países desarrollados y conocidos
> por su excelente atención en salud. Los neonatos son más vulnerables a
> infecciones ya que su sistema inmunológico no acaba de madurar.

Regarding the death of infants in different cities in the country, [Minister
David Chiriboga] indicated that it is estimated that globally, between 5 and
10 percent of patients admitted to any hospital acquire hospital infections.
Of this figure, 25 percent occur in the intensive care unit. Neonatal
infections are a global problem and not just one that occurs in Ecuador, it is
present even in hospitals in developed countries known for their excellent
health care. Infants are more vulnerable to infections because their immune
system is not completely mature.

[New reports](http://www.desarrollosocial.gob.ec/ministra-jeannette-sanchez-y-
ministro-david-chiriboga-tuvieron-un-conversatorio-con-lideres-de-
opinion-1216.html) [es] show newborn deaths are decreasing. In 2008 the rate
of neonatal deaths from 21 hospitals in Ecuador was 7.38 percent; in 2009 this
figure dropped to 6.9 percent, and in 2010 it decreased to 5.69 percent.

Blogger Henry Raad predicts this issue will not be solved any time soon. He
says the problem with public health is a matter of pragmatism; Ecuadorians
need to stop relying so heavily on the [SENPLADES
](http://www.senplades.gov.ec/web/senplades-
portal/inicio;jsessionid=675392C2E001F4999A9CCA11B444161B)[es] (Ministry of
Planning and National Development) because the [Ecuadorian health system is
not self-sustaining ](http://www.henryraadanton.com/2011/03/japon-libia-y-
ecuador.html)[es].

Martin Pallares, on the other hand, believes that it is necessary to evaluate
the government's public investment. He says that only the stubborn can deny
that the scale of public works undertaken by the current Ecuadorian
administration has been enormous. But are these public works really doing any
good?, he asks in his blog _[Desde la
Tranquera](http://desdelatranquera.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/una-tarea-para-el-
cholito-y-bonafont/) _[es].
