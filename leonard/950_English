On December 22, the Ecuadorian television channel
[Teleamazonas](http://www.teleamazonas.com/) was [taken off the
air](http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/12/22/world/international-uk-ecuador-
television.html) by the [Superintendent of Telecommunications
[es]](http://www.supertel.gov.ec/), under a provisional suspension of 72
hours. Teleamazonas is a channel that has been characterized as one that does
not follow the official governmental line. During those 3 years, it has
maintained strong discrepancies with President Rafael Correa's regime, which
has called many times for the closing of the television channel.

The Superintendent of Telecommunications justified the channel's closing
because of the events of May 22, 2009, when it spread news based on
assumptions regarding the exploitation of gas on the Puná Island that will
affect the residents of the island, who make a living in the fishing industry.
According to the Superintendent, upon spreading the news, Teleamazonas
violated Article 18, Number 1 of the current Constitution that establishes the
right of all persons to “look for, receive, exchange, produce and spread true,
verified, timely, diverse, uncensored facts, events, and general interest
processes is and with ulterior responsibility.”

Soon after, there were voices of protest from different sectors in Ecuador,
which are also planning marches and protests against the measure. For many, it
is an attack on freedom of expression. This recent event is also relevant just
as the members of [the National Congress are debating the new Communications
Law,](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/18/ecuador-debates-over-new-
communication-law/) which was made known after dissolving a previous agreement
between assembly members from the governmental party and opposition.

There are also online opinions for and against the government measure. For
many, the closing of the television channel is a clear attack on free press
and it also becomes an intimidating act. For Xica of the blog _[La Alharaca
[es]](http://laalharaca.com/2009/12/23/primer-canal-sacado-del-aire-en-
ecuador/)_ :

> Por más de que el gobierno ecuatoriano haya decidido sacar del aire a

For as much as the Ecuadorian government has decided to take Teleamazonas off
the air for only 3 days, it is enough to send a strong message to other media
and to the members of the assembly: we can close a media channel and we do not
need a media law to do so.

The editorial line of Teleamazonas, which is against the government, also has
its detractors, and many news anchorman Jorge Ortiz as its visible head, which
always makes biting comments against the government. In addition, the fact
that the channel is own by banker Fidel Egas also places public speculation
about impartiality and information bias. In regards to this, Eduardo Varas of
the blog _[Más Libros, Autores y Otros Riesgos
[es]](http://eduardovarasc.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/asco-y-sodomia-
revolucionaria/)_ writes:

To applaud that it is the Executive branch that calls to prohibit opinions or
define what or what is not a profession is a cruel act that confuses
everything and it is not important to them. All of us should have the freedom
to say what we want, if we are a media outlet with all of the money in the
world and with an owner who thinks of himself as the conveyor of truth, or a
president who also thinks of himself as the owner of the truth, or an idiot
like me, or idiots that celebrate the closing of media channels as fair
maneuvers. All of us.

The suspension is already finalized and it yet to see if this will affect the
new Communication Law that is currently being debate in the National Congress.
