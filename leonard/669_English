The recently released United Nations World Investment Report 2010 brought to
light the shape of the Malaysian economy to its citizens: Foreign direct
investment (FDI) has dropped 81% from 2008 to 2009, from US$ 7.32 billion in
2008 to US$ 1.38 billion in 2009.

News portal Malaysiakini [explained it in simpler
terms](http://malaysiakini.com/news/138165):

> The 2009 FDI is less than half of the annual average FDI inflow between 1995
> to 2005, which encompasses the long recovery period following the 1997
> economic crisis.

Tony Pua, a Member of Parliament in the Democratic Action Party (DAP), one of
the opposition parties in Malaysia, wrote in his blog about [what the
statistics mean](http://tonypua.blogspot.com/2010/07/foreign-direct-
investments-what.html):

> **1\. For the first time ever in history, Malaysia attracted less investment
> than the Philippines.**
>
> **2\. Compared to the previous year 2008, Malaysia suffered by far the
> biggest decline of FDI in Southeast Asia.**
>
> **3\. Malaysia was the only country in Southeast Asia to have register a net
> negative Foreign Direct Investment Flow.**
>
> **4\. For the first time ever, cumulative Outward FDI Stock exceeded
> cumulative FDI Inward Stock.**
>
> **5\. Barring a “blip” in 2001 when we attracted only US$0.55 billion in
> FDI, this is the first time we've attracted less than US$2 billion in FDI
> over the past 20 years.**

Regina Lee from Malaysiakini [quoted](http://malaysiakini.com/news/138241) RAM
Holdings group chief economist Yeah Kim Leng's comment on the issue:

> …should the FDI that has flowed to the neighbouring countries rather than
> Malaysia, be of high value and be more technology driven, then we could very
> well lose out on the opportunity to be the regional meeting point.
> Especially when Asean is mulling region-wide economic cooperation. The lack
> of FDI could also mean that the country may not be able to upgrade its
> investments and could in the end, “hollow out”. It could result in de-
> industrialisation. In the short term, Malaysia could lose skilled and
> unskilled workers. In the medium to long term, we will need to focus on
> higher value and technology driven investments to put us back ahead of our
> neighbouring countries. Malaysia could end up being caught in the middle-
> income trap

However, Malaysian news agency Bernama reported that the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) has [released a
statement](http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsbusiness.php?id=516577)
announcing that FDI “for the first quarter of 2010 nearly matched the full
year of 2009″. Its minister, Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed, said in the report:

> FDI inflows totalled RM5.06 billion for the January to March 2010 period,
> compared with RM5.66 billion for all of 2009.

Meanwhile, The Star newspaper
[quoted](http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/27/business/6738411&sec=business)
CIMB Group Holdings CEO Datuk Seri Nazir Razak as saying:

> It doesn’t mean that lower net investment flow is necessarily bad … We need
> to look at the quality of the investments and look at the facts in terms of
> the timing of investments.

Kamal Malhotra, the United Nations’ resident coordinator for Malaysia, [summed
it up](http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsbusiness.php?id=515932):

> Although concerns over declining investment and engaging private sector
> participation in the economy were dealt with in the New Economic Policy and
> 10th Malaysia Plan, the challenge for Malaysia will, however, be in
> converting the lofty vision and content of these documents into
> implementation reality in the next five to 10 years
