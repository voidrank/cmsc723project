Amidst the ongoing debate of the role of social media in revolutions across
the Middle East and North Africa lies another question: To what degree does
Internet access matter in determining the role of the Internet and social
media in these revolts? In Egypt and Tunisia, many attribute an important role
to online tools while others
[debate](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/21/arab-world-the-great-
social-media-debate/) their worth; most observers [fall somewhere in the
middle](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/22/egypt-social-media-in-the-
middle-east-as-a-tool-for-incremental-change/), recognizing the value of the
Internet but remaining realistic about its limitations.

On my own blog, I framed the question slightly differently,
[asking](http://jilliancyork.com/2011/03/01/internet-mobile-access-and-social-
movements-libya-madagascar-beyond/):

> The normative question in relation to the Internet (mobile is obviously a
> different story) is, then, how much do basic indicators like Internet and
> mobile penetration affect the effectiveness of such tools for organizational
> or revolutionary purposes? Or, can a tiny group of Internet users influence
> a countrywide movement?

But in comparing the role of the Internet in Egypt (where most accounts* put
Internet penetration between 20-25%) and Tunisia (which hovers closer to 35%)
to the potential role of the Internet in other countries, one must take into
consideration the access in that country. In Libya, for example, access to the
Internet is only available to about 5% of the population. Statistics on
individual social media sites are also important when analyzing their role in
a protest movement. CNN has an excellent map of Facebook and Internet
penetration in the Middle East and North Africa
[here](http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2011/02/tech/map.mideast.tech/index.html).

Blogger Andrew Trench recently presented a theory on the threshold of when
Internet penetration starts to matter,
[writing](http://www.andrewtrench.com/2011/02/02/predicting-revolution-based-
internet-penetration/):

> Social networks have also been given plenty of credit for the revolution
> unfolding in Egypt.
>
> So I went and had a look at the numbers over on www.internetworldstats.com
> to see what they could tell us about these two scenarios. Well,
> fascinatingly, both Egypt and Tunisia have seen a massive growth in internet
> users and internet penetration over the last 10 years.  
>  Both have now got internet penetration of over 20% and in Tunisia's case it
> was as high as 34%.
>
> While it is clearly simplistic to over-state this factor and there must be
> many more drivers contributing to such a rapid political uprising, it is
> obviously a factor as evidenced by the Egyptian regime pulling the plug on
> the country's internet access to try and block the rising tide of revolt.
>
> My back-of-napkin theory is this: that a rapid increase in internet
> penetration in a repressive regime does play an important role as it
> provides an unfettered channel of communication allowing disaffected
> citizens to share views – and more importantly – to rapidly organise and
> mobilise.
>
> If Egypt and Tunisia are valid case studies, it looks like internet
> penetration of around 20% is the mark.

[adds](http://geoeconviews.blogspot.com/2011/02/dominoes-tunisia-egypt-
libya.html):

> Internet penetration: Social networking sites were critical to sustaining

[writes](http://community.brandrepublic.com/blogs/frompakistan/archive/2011/03/07/the-

The role of mobile receives perhaps even less media attention than the role of
other technologies. And yet, mobile penetration is higher across the region
than Internet, with only Yemen, the occupied Palestinian territories, and
Syria reporting fewer than 50% mobile subscribers. Several countries in the
Middle East and North Africa, including Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the UAE,
boasted mobile subscriber rates of over 100%.
[MobileActive](http://www.mobileactive.org/mobiledata) has detailed mobile
data by country.

Micah Sifry, writing for TechPresident, has also considered mobile,
[arguing](http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/egypt-tunisia-generation-txt-
comes-age):

> The biggest factor in the unfolding events, to me, appears to be the
> emergent power of young people, compounded by how urbanized they are and how
> connected they are by mobile phones.
>
> If you look at the available data on degree of internet penetration, number
> of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people, percentage of population
> under the age of 15 and degree of urbanization, what jumps out is how the
> last three factors seem to matter more.

Sifry adds:

> With the exception of Yemen, mobile coverage in the other five countries
> I've focused on–Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Jordan and Iran–hovers between 98%
> and 100%.

> Finally, the pace of mobile phone penetration has exploded, far faster than
> internet penetration. With the exception of Jordan, which boasted a 23%

> ownership was in the single digits–just six percent in Egypt and Tunisia
> back then. That has skyrocketed in 2007 to 76% in Tunisia and 40% in Egypt,

*For those interested in learning more about Internet penetration globally, there are two main organizations which track such data: the [International Telecommunications Union](http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/icteye/Indicators/Indicators.aspx#), and the [World Bank](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/0,,contentMDK:22059113~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282823,00.html). Their statistics sometimes differ. The website [Internet World Stats](http://internetworldstats.com/) aggregates their data, as well as the data from smaller or more localized institutions.
