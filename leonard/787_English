For the first time in Russian history, [Andrzej
Wajda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda)‘s [ENG]
“[Katyń](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy%C5%84_\(film\))” (2007) has been
aired on Russian public [television channel
“Kultura”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kultura_\(TV_channel\)) [ENG]
provoking online discussions on Stalin regime, historical truth, humanism and
Russian-Poland relations.

[The Katyn massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) [ENG], a
deliberate execution of almost 22,000 Polish officers by the Russian [NKVD
officers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD) [ENG] in 1940 remains the main
unresolved historical issue between contemporary Russia and Poland. Throughout
almost 50 years official Soviet propaganda said that Katyn had been a Nazi war
crime until in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev recognized the NKVD murders.

Russian government's position on the issue was far from straightforward since
that. In 1990, the Russian Prosecutor's Office started investigation of the
horrible incident. In 1992, Russian president Boris Yeltsin shared a part of
the secret archives containing evidence of the NKVD executions. But in 2004
(already under Putin), the case was closed due to the death of the guilty
(executors). Polish officers shot in Katyn along with thousands of Soviet
political prisoners were neither rehabilitated nor recognized as repressed.
While in Poland Katyn massacre became one of the new nation-building symbols
of martyrdom, there's no common view on the issue in the Russian society as
there's [a group of historians promoting Soviet point of
view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Ignatyevich_Mukhin) [ENG]backed up by
communist party together with some veterans of NKVD. The Soviet version is
still transmitted in popular newspaper like
“[Pravda](http://www.pravda.ru/politics/parties/other/02-04-2010/1025806-Katyn-0/),”[RUS]
and by some popular bloggers like Russian intellectual Anatoliy Wasserman.

Followed by a serious worsening of relations between the two countries in
2005-2007 ([Meat trade
dispute](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-174021143.html) [ENG], Missile
dispute, etc.), things started to change in 2007. The prime-ministers of
Poland and Russia launched [the Commission on Difficult
Issues](http://dmitry-p.livejournal.com/17023.html) [RUS], which mission was
to settle down a large number of historical issues between the countries. The
Katyn massacre stood as a central point of the debate. [Most experts agree
[RUS]](http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/2001204.html) that the
appearance of “Katyń” on Russian public TV was due to the work of the
commission and upcoming commemoration of the Katyń massacre.

“Katyń” was aired during Friday prime-time (19:40 – 21:30) with the discussion
after the show. It was claimed that the Channel One (Russian leading TV
channel) simultaneously Oscar-winning “Hurt Locker” on purpose but that turned
out to be inaccurate (“Katyn” ended at 21:30, while “Hurt Locker” began at
this very time). Interesting feature of the TV-discussion that followed the
movie was that none of the Polish representatives was invited.

The online discussion of the movie [gathered more than 2100 blog
posts](http://blogs.yandex.ru/search.xml?cat=theme&id=12505&group=2) [RUS] and
became #5 topic in the Yandex discussion rating. Bloggers were divided in
their opinions. Some completely denied the version of NKVD murders (claimed to
be the Goebbels’ version as the Nazis were the first to announce Katyn
massacres). Among those who recognized the NKVD murders, opinions weren't
uniform either. Despite some bloggers’ claims “Katyń” was [“market-
oriented,”](http://moon-in-spain.livejournal.com/66302.html) “Anti-soviet on
purpose,” [“too outlined,”](http://object.livejournal.com/1340019.html) “[made
to order,](http://leo-mosk.livejournal.com/320425.html)” the majority of
Runetizens said they were deeply touched by the movie.

Most bloggers denounced the myth of the movie's hidden
[russophobia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Russian_sentiment) (anti-
russian sentiment).

For me, frankly speaking, this film didn't seem russophobic at all. Something
was a cliche and way too straightforward (tearing flag for socks), but not
primitive or rancorous. I'm under very strong impression.

Nobody else in Poland could make no-antirussian (non-russophobic) movie on the
Katyn topic. But Wajda managed to do that.

One of the main current of those discussions was the search for the reason of
the mass murders. “Usual” (in this kind of discussions) versions like
“strategic necessity,” “[revenge for 16,000-20,000 Soviet prisoners of war who
died in the Polish camps after Soviet-Polish
war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camps_for_Russian_prisoners_and_internees_in_Poland_\(1919-1924\))“[ENG]
and others were offered. LJ user _Yasko_ [repeated deputy Kosachev's
explanation [ENG]](http://yasko.livejournal.com/93267.html) of the massacre in
terms of the essential blood-lust of the faceless totalitarian regime:

> Совершенно гениально пан Вайда показал нам, что это работала именно машина

> западной цивилизации, это тема выходящая уже за пределы темы Катыни, в том

Mr.Wajda absolutely ingeniously showed us that it was a human-killing machine.
And the thing is that this machine is a child of the Western thought, Western
civilization – this topic is much broader than the topic of Katyn in the given
scale it should be revealed today. And this is what Wajda did.

Not everyone accepted the notion of faceless machine. LJ user

However, let's stop lying, there's a definite author of this “machine” and
he's shown in the movie. “[The Effective
Manager](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/world/europe/31iht-
stalin.4.15773911.html)” [a reference to Stalin's description in the new
Russian teacher's manual – GVO] looks from the wall in the episode of the
verdict given by “troika” to the Polish general. Why did he do that – I don't
know.

The humanism topic was raised by popular movie critic
_[kinanet](http://kinanet.livejournal.com/1803717.html)_ :

The true danger of Wajda's movies, which frightened contemporary Russian
overcautious politics, is in the human dimension of the political tragedy,
which doesn't end with the investigation of all circumstances in the Katyn
forest.  
…  
We got used to worshiping false idols, false ideals, and most importantly – to
love not fathers’ graves but the tombs of leaders and their spongers at the
Red Square. And this is why we miss the former grandeur, which was overrated,
because it's basement was built on blood and violence. So are we humans?

It seems that the movie had an effect. After viewing it, Yelena Tokareva,
editor-in-chief of the tabloid _“Stringer,”_ publicly [said she
was](http://elena-tokareva2.livejournal.com/235535.html#cutid1) [RUS] sorry
for the negative reviews that were published in her magazine.

The effect was especially significant for those Russians who were not aware of
the issue. If not in a historical but at least in a moral way. As
_eli_prophet_ put it:

I was quite pleased that even after three years after the official release,
even if not on a very popular channel, it was showed on the public TV on
Friday (and not every Friday but Easter Friday) during prime-time. This isn't
a huge step, but a step worth of respect. And it seems important to me that as
many people in our country would have a possibility to look at the events of
the World War II with the naked eye, from a new angle.
