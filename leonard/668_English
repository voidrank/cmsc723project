On June 29, 2010, the whole Cabinet of the government of the Maldives
[submitted their resignation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10452297) to President
Mohamed Nasheed, on the grounds that their work was severely restricted by an
opposition-led Parliament, which the cabinet members accused of encroaching on
the powers of the Executive. The ex-ministers claimed recent Bills passed by
the parliament were anti-constitutional and restricted them from delivering
essential public services. The opposition members of parliament defended their
actions as holding the Executive accountable and preventing abuse of Executive
powers. Thus began a highly politicized drama in the Maldives; one that
threatens the country’s romance with democracy, and poses serious questions
about the political stability of the island nation in the coming days.

Shortly after the Cabinet resigned, two high profile opposition MPs were
[arrested](http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iVfQemSN-
yB-zwywTXzYUsoifNJg) by the police, on suspicion of bribing MPs. Meanwhile,
audio clips, believed to be mobile phone conversations between four opposition
MPs, were anonymously leaked to the media. The audio clips [suggest bribery of
MPs](http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/maldives/Cash-for-votes-probe-in-
Maldives/Article1-567971.aspx) and undue influence exerted on the Maldives’
Anti-Corruption Commission by politicians, while the leak has created a debate
over the legality of the government spying on citizens through wiretapping.

As the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest party in the ruling
coalition, tried to mobilize its supporters on to the streets in what it
described as an anti-corruption campaign, the opposition parties accused the
government of conducting a witch-hunt to eliminate political opposition.
Shortly after the Supreme Court ruled that the detained MPs should be
released, the judiciary became a target of the anti-corruption drive, with
accusations leveled against judges of accepting bribes. While the judiciary
had been previously criticized by the civil society [for failure to deliver
justice and of lacking independence](http://www.madulu.org/blog/judicial-
reform/insaaf-or-just-campaign-begins/), harassment of judges has been a
hallmark of recent demonstrations organized by political parties. The
demonstrations have led to violence and destruction of private property,
causing fears that the peaceful democratic transition the country was
experiencing may backtrack. The resigned Cabinet members have been [sworn in
again](http://doreview.blogspot.com/2010/07/maldives-cabinet-re-
instated.html); however, they have to be approved by the parliament, which
refuses to continue sessions because an opposition leader is being detained by
the security forces without a court warrant.

As the three powers of the government – the Executive, the Legislature and the
Judiciary – undergo confrontations, Bloggers react to [the largest political
crisis facing the Maldives](http://www.madulu.org/blog/democracy/press-
statement-political-unrest-maldives/) since its first democratic election of
November 2008.

_Ibra,_ a former MP, argues in his blog that the Parliamentary Committee for
Independent Commissions should investigate allegations that Anti-Corruption
Commission is [unduly being influenced by
politicians](http://ibra2008.blogspot.com/2010/07/open-letter-to-honourable-
mohamed.html):

> It is most untoward that an Independent Commission may be intimidated in
> this fashion to subvert the course of governance and justice to further the
> political ambitions of any person.
>
> Further, members of the Anti-Corruption Commission should also be summoned
> to the Majlis and required to reveal all that they know of these matters,
> and any possible such matters in the past. If they are being intimidated and
> threatened in any way, they should be accorded the full protection of the
> State so that they may discharge their duties in accordance with the
> Constitution and the Law.
>
> The hearings of the Committee with regard to these matters should be open to

> matters.

_Mhilmyh_ muses about the [current situation of the
Maldives](http://mhilmy.blogspot.com/2010/07/gandhis-seven-deadly-sins.html):

> Mahatma Gandhi said that seven things will destroy a society.
> [(Link)](http://www.gandhifoundation.net/mgmnt.htm)
>
> 1)Wealth without work  
>  2)Pleasure without conscience  
>  3)Knowledge without character  
>  4)Commerce (business) without morality (ethics)  
>  5)Science without humanity  
>  6)Religion without sacrifice  
>  7)Politics without principle
>
> All of these conditions are evident in the social and political fabric of
> our society today.
>
> Now we have freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. We have the
> separation of powers and we have independent institutions, still in the
> early stages of the democratic process. With the new found freedoms our
> society is on the brink of anarchy.

_Maldivianism_ [draws parallels](http://maldivianism.tumblr.com/#816173783)
between the anti-corruption campaign in the Maldives and George W Bush’s claim
that Weapons of Mass Destruction existed in Iraq:

> I remember the beginning of the gradual demise of George W.’s Presidency as
> the people of the United States realized their president based invasion of a
> middle east country on flawed intelligence.
>
> ARE WE FOLLOWING A SIMILAR PATH?
>
> Instead of WMDs we have WMCs – Weapons of Mass Corruption inside the
> Parliament.
>
> I remember the government released audio tapes of key parliamentarians
> plotting cash for votes and buying party loyalty.
>
> I remember parliamentarians being taken to court charged with attempt to
> topple a government.
>
> I remember the court concurring there was insufficient proof to hold
> parliamentarians under house arrest.
>
> I remember the government retaliating with protests, riots leading to
> aggression and disturbance of peace.

_Hassan Ziyau_ writes about the [implications of the leaked audio
clips](http://hassanziyau.blogspot.com/2010/07/clash-of-democratic-pillars-in-
maldives.html):

> The leaked audio clips also has broken the trust that the Maldivian had for

> the recording phone conversation could be done only by ‘security forces’ or

_Ziyau_ also has some advice for the various institutions and pillars of the
state:

> Of course the democracy is yet still a new thing in the Maldives, and such
> drama might be expected. Even though we all know that the pillars of the
> democracy are all independent, that however does not mean one has the power

> political parties need to stop promoting their individual agendas and make
> the system easier for the people. Let each pillar do its work without much
> hindrance from the other.

As the political crisis in the Maldives deepens, it remains to be seen if
politicians will listen to Bloggers such as _Ziyau_.
