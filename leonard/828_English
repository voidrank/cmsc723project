In a December 2009 Global Voices article titled [“ICT4D: Past mistakes, future
wisdom,”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/14/ict4d-past-mistakes-
future-wisdom/) Aparna Ray points out that many technology for development
projects have “started with a bang and later died with a whimper.” According
to a [recent
article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0381356e-1b63-11df-838f-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F0381356e-1b63-11df-838f-00144feab49a.html&_i_referer=)
in the _Financial Times_ , such is the fate of a multimillion dollar World
Bank plan to supply Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan, with computers and
Internet access.

According to Laurence Clarke, who heads the World Bank's program in the
country and was interviewed for the article, the failure was not due to a lack
of equipment or support. Instead, the problem is a lack of will:

> Laurence Clarke, head of the bank's south Sudan programme, explains that

> links in Juba, the south's threadbare capital. But then “all kinds of

> “Some of the ministers apparently decided they were too old to learn to use

> younger assistants did not know how to log on. “So the system is lying

The recent surge in availability of [mobile
phones](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/22/africa-mobile-phones-
usage-rise) and [Internet
access](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/07/nigeria-new-submarine-
internet-cable-lands-in-lagos/) in Africa has prompted considerable enthusiasm
regarding the use of these technologies for everything from
[marketing](http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/-/2560/866112/-/4dol8sz/-/)
and [e-commerce](http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/%27mobile-phones-
revolutionise-e-commerce-in-africa%27-2010020243402.html) to [tracking crop
diseases](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/science/06uganda.html) and
[reminding HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis
patients](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/02/23/global-health-mobile-
phones-to-boost-healthcare/) to take their medicine. But the news from
Southern Sudan forces the question: is the hype surrounding information and
communication technology (ICT) justified? And how can those of us who work in
this field make sure that our efforts don't result in moribundity?

As a researcher for the [Technology for Transparency
Network](https://transparency.globalvoicesonline.org), I'm particularly
interested in the way that ICT can help engage citizens in the governance of
their country and encourage governments to be both transparent and
accountable. Many projects are successfully using technology for transparency;
David Sasaki's recent [review](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/03/02/the-
technology-for-transparency-review-part-i/) of the network's first eight case
studies shows as much. But, as the situation in Juba shows, technology does
not magically lead toward better governance.

Sudanese blogger and Global Voices author
[Drima](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/sudanese/) believes that
Internet and mobile phones are not enough. “ICT is merely that, a technology.
Its real usefulness is ultimately something that can only be realized if the
users utilize such technology skillfully towards a good goal,” he writes in an
e-mail.

If technology is to have an impact, Drima says, support must come not only
from donors, but from within:

> “When it comes to attitudes and goals, this is something the Southern
> Sudanese need to fix. And before we can even get into this whole idea of ICT
> as some kind of ‘silver bullet’ we really need to address many underlying
> concerns, beginning with corrupt leadership and destructive tribalism.”

As Sudan moves towards elections in April, technology has the potential to
play a major role in both engaging citizens and in monitoring the political
process. [Sudan Votes](http://www.sudanvotes.com/), a bilingual web site
sponsored by German organization [Media in Cooperation and
Transition](http://www.mict-international.org/) along with Sudanese
organizations [Teeba Press](http://site.teebapress.com/index.php) and the
Association of Inter-Media, hopes to “enhance the quality of media coverage on
the elections” and “promote a better understanding across language barriers.”
The site features articles on topics ranging from politics to health and
culture, as well as a [Sudan Electionnaire](http://www.electionnaire.com/) to
help citizens learn more about the country's political parties.

Sudan Votes

[Sudan Vote Monitor](http://sudanvotemonitor.com/), led by the [Sudan
Institute for Research and Policy](http://www.sudaninstitute.org/), plans to
use [Ushahidi](http://ushahidi.com/) to enable citizens to monitor and report
on the elections.

Sudan Vote Monitor

In an election where [“many citizens are unfamiliar with basic election
processes, are opposed to multi-party competition and have doubts about
whether the vote will be fair,”](http://ndi.org/node/15797) these projects may
play critical roles in educating people and documenting possible problems with
the voting process. In order to be successful, however, they must first find a
way to convince citizens of their usefulness.

Both Sudan Votes and Sudan Vote Monitor appear to have substantial Sudanese
involvement at the ground level, which may help them succeed where the World
Bank program has failed. As the elections loom nearer, I'll be watching
closely to see how these organizations unfold. Will they fall flat, ignored
and unused by Sudanese citizens? Or will they manage to translate technology
into true civic engagement?
