![Afghan children](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2010/01/3254589895_d357ac54cb_m.jpg)Last year was the
[deadliest
one](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/world/asia/14kabul.html?scp=16&sq=afghanistan&st=cse)
for Afghanistan's civilians, including children, since the American-led war
began in 2001.

Children have increasingly become victims of the conflict — Afghanistan Rights
Monitor [recently
showed](http://www.afghanconflictmonitor.org/2010/01/2009-worst-year-for-
afghan-children-arm.html) that about 1,050 children died in 2009 in war-
related incidents and there were at least 2,080 cases of grave violations of
child rights, such as recruitment of kids as suicide bombers and foot soldiers
and forced labor. Three decades of conflict has also had [long-term
repercussions](http://www.undp.org.af/whoweare/undpinafghanistan/Projects/dcse/prj_youth.htm)
on the country's youth, many of whom are disfranchised and lack educational
and employment opportunities. Literacy and secondary school enrollment rates
are also low. The situation for Afghan girls and women is particularly
concerning; a December report
[shows](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/12/03/afghanistan-keep-promises-
afghan-women) that they suffer high levels of violence and discrimination and
have poor access to justice and education. Afghan girls are also under
traditional pressures to enter early marriage and early pregnancy.

The _Youth Parliament_ blog, based in India,
[elaborates](http://theyouthparliament.blogspot.com/2008/05/placing-
afghanistan.html) on the situation:

> “Possibly one of the biggest roles in the process of restructuring
> Afghanistan can be played by the youth of Afghanistan. 68% of the Afghan
> population consists of people who are under the age of 25 years. However,
> the long period of war has deprived many of them of their youth and
> childhood. Categorized as the ‘lost generation’ of Afghanistan, the socially
> imposed silence and lack of education has suppressed large sections of the
> Afghan youth. Moreover, the youth is hardly seen as a direct mechanism for
> peace building, but only as possible recruits for various terrorist
> organizations.”

Despite the circumstances, efforts are being made nationwide by and for youth
to maintain their health and education and to empower them. The _Youth
Parliament_ blog [continues](
http://theyouthparliament.blogspot.com/2008/05/placing-afghanistan.html):

> “The youth has been able to overcome some of these barriers in the recent
> past to play a more active role. This is evident from the existence of a
> number of youth organisations spread over the entire country which have
> undertaken the task of promoting non-formal education, increasing awareness,
> promoting volunteerism for peace and development of the country and most of
> them have got integrated in the government or working of other NGOs.”

Examples of youth involvement range from a teen [training to be
midwife](https://www.worldvision.org/news.nsf/news/afghanistan-
midwives-200909-enews) to help combat the country's high maternal mortality
rate to young women
[protesting](http://saradavidsonblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/part-5-womens-lib-
afghan-style.html) against a law restricting their rights to a young woman
nurturing [Afghan girls through soccer](http://www.awistaayub.com/). In Kabul,
another sport is being used to get kids off the street and stay active —
skateboarding. [Skateistan](http://skateistan.org/) teaches boys and girls how
to skateboard, among other skills such as skateboard instruction, literacy and
computer skills. Skateboarding offers a rare opportunity for Afghan girls to
participate in a public sport, helping break down traditional barriers, as
this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMX9PKDt5Lg) documents. The blog
_I Skate, Therefore I am_ provides
[background](http://poolrider.blogspot.com/2009/12/12-24-09.html) on the
initiative:

> “Skateistan started two years ago in a dried-up fountain in the heart of the
> Afghan capital, when two Australians with three skateboards started teaching
> a small group of fascinated kids. It is now Afghanistan’s (and the world’s)
> first co-educational skateboarding school. The school engages growing
> numbers of urban and internally-displaced youth in Afghanistan through
> skateboarding and provides them with new opportunities in cross-cultural
> interaction, education, and personal empowerment programs.”

_The bright lines_ [discusses](http://nandininessa.com/2009/10/19/skateistan-
kabuls-skate-park-opens-1029/) the opening of Afghanistan's first indoor
skateboarding park and its significance:

> “On October 29, 2009, Skateistan will be opening the largest indoor sports
> facility & skate park in Kabul. It’s incredible how this team of instructors
> is engaging young folk in the art of skateboarding, in a place where the
> social opportunities for them, especially young girls, is limited because of
> the U.S. war in Afghanistan. The goal is to bring indoor & outdoor
> skateboarding facilities to Afghanistan. There’s going to be separate
> classes for young girls.”

Some young women are also finding an outlet for self-expression, healing and
outreach via writing. [_The Afghan Women’s Writing
Project_](http://awwproject.wordpress.com) is a blog started by novelist Masha
Hamilton that connects Afghan women, between the ages of 18 and 28, with
writing instructors in the United States. Its goal is to allow Afghan women to
have a voice that isn't filtered through male relatives or the media. The
young women's writing covers issues ranging from the joy of [playing
basketball](http://awwproject.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/an-afghan-girl-plays-
basketball/) to [death
threats](http://awwproject.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/kill-silence/) from the
Taliban to [breaking the
silence](http://awwproject.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/kill-silence/). In this
[post](http://awwproject.wordpress.com/2010/01/03/i-am-for-sale-who-will-buy-
me/), an anonymous blogger talks about how she is being forced into a marriage
and in desperate need of solutions:

> “After my father died, the responsibility for me fell to my brothers, who
> grew up under the Taliban government and were influenced by it. Now I live
> with three Talibs and I must obey what they say. I am not like a girl in the
> house, but a slave. When I was at third year at the university, the owner of
> our house demanded higher rent. My family decided they would leave Kabul and
> go to a province where housing was cheaper. But I didn’t know how I would
> continue my studies in that case, so I gave up my transportation money to
> help pay for our rent, and I go to the university on foot.
>
> Still, at the beginning of this year, my brothers said: “It is time for you
> to marry.” They arranged a marriage to my first cousin, my mom’s brother’s
> son, who lives in a province where most of the people are Talib. My cousin
> is about 40 years old and uneducated. His family has a business and a big
> house. Their women are required to wear burqas and are responsible for
> cooking, cleaning and caring for the animals. Most have eight or nine
> children. They can’t go outside the house—even when they are sick, they
> aren’t allowed to go to the doctor.”

Many of the young women also express their sentiments through poetry. In these
segments of a poem, Shogofa
[shares](http://awwproject.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/women-walking-alone/) her
story:

> “I am from long line of women who have walked alone …  
>  From a land that smells of the blood of innocent people  
>  From a people who have lost everything in war – sons, daughters, fathers,
> and mothers  
>  From a people feeling hopeless
>
> …
>
> I am from long line of women who have walked alone…  
>  I know now how to enter society  
>  And find my answers though I’m alone  
>  Learn from my experience though I have failed many times  
>  I never give up  
>  I find my way and learn nothing is impossible to achieve  
>  I ignore those things that destroy my mind  
>  I learn that no one can help me except me  
>  I accept reality and I’m ready to face any problem  
>  Now I have ambition to achieve my goal  
>  To help my people bring peace to the next generation”

Others also remain hopeful about the future of Afghanistan and the role youth
can play in bringing peace and security. Mozhdah Jamalzadah, blogging on
_Afghanistan Through My Eyes_ ,
[says](http://afghanistanthroughmyeyes.blogspot.com/2010/01/one-thing-that-
impressed-me-very-much.html):

> “One thing that impressed me very much about the younger generation in
> Afghanistan, at least from what I’ve seen so far, is that they are so eager
> to learn, and they strive for success. Even with the lack, and low standard
> of education these kids try to gain as much as they can. They are incredibly
> intelligent. In North America where education system is absolutely amazing,
> most kids will do only what they have to in order to get to the next level.
> Most are not passionate. I believe if you give the same opportunities to
> these Afghan youth who are so hungry for knowledge, who knows how far they
> can take it. The sky is the limit.”
