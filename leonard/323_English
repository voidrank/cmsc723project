The crisis in Libya since the uprisings against Colonel Mouammar Gaddafi has
not only had dramatic consequences for Libyans, but also for Sub-Saharan
African citizens residing in Libya. Thousands of refugees are exposed to
terrible conditions on journeys to the nearest borders, and numerous black
Africans currently do not dare to leave their homes, not even to find
something to eat. Why is this?

The digital portal for the civil society of Maghreb _e-Joussour.net_ [explains
in an article](http://www.e-joussour.net/fr/node/8343) [fr] published on March
2, 2011:

> De peur d'être pris pour des mercenaires à la solde du pouvoir de Mouammar
> Kadhafi, les migrants subsahariens vivant en Libye se cachent depuis le
> début de la répression sanglante, au risque de se retrouver oubliés dans ce
> pays qu'ils veulent quitter.

For fear of being mistaken as mercenaries working to uphold the powerful
regime of Mouammar Gaddafi, Sub-Saharan migrants living in Libya have been
forced to hide ever since the onslaught of the repression began. Yet they run
the risk of finding themselves forgotten in a county they wish to leave.

Hundreds of thousands have migrated to Libya from all over the African
continent, notably from the countries within close proximity, such as
approximately 300,000 from Chad, 50,000 from Nigeria and 10,000 from
Mauritania. In an article on
[Mediapart](http://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/010311/les-migrants-
subsahariens-vivent-terres-en-libye) [fr] (subscription required), Carine
Fouteau remarks:

> Regrouped according to nationality in certain areas of the larger cities,
> they are calling for help but are not heard. ‘The Sub-Saharan Africans are
> afraid. After the information we received from the Malians, they gather
> together as much as possible, up to 10, 20 or 30 at a time. They cannot get
> out, they live underground. Anyone with black skin is in hiding because
> certain individuals have experienced some abuse”, reports Alassane Dicko,
> one of the co-ordinators/leaders of the Malian Association of Deportation
> (AME), situated in Bamako.

Al Jazeera English shares a video [report on the dangers faced by black
Africans in
Libya](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201122865814378541.html).

In a report of Malian testimonies on the website _Bamanet.net_ , Abdou Karim
Maiga [recounts the experience of certain
individuals](http://www.bamanet.net/index.php/actualite/autres-
presses/13322-immigration--des-centaines-dimmigres-maliens-bloques-en-
libye.html) [fr] who are refusing to flee.

> Mamadou Diakite, who is around thirty and works as a civil servant, recounts

> especially since the press began to speak of the implication that many

> our president supports Gaddafi and therefore we are viewed as traitors.

Another Malian, Chaka Sidibe, arrived in Libya just four months ago. He
affirms that for several nights he and his friends have not slept and [adds
that](http://www.bamanet.net/index.php/actualite/autres-
presses/13322-immigration--des-centaines-dimmigres-maliens-bloques-en-
libye.html) [fr]:

> We have been abandoned by our Chinese bosses who have been evacuated by
> their country and their villagers have asked us to leave as quickly as
> possible. We came together and crossed the Egyptian border by foot.

The website ___Relief Web_ [reports real life
stories](http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MCOI-8EMDXU?OpenDocument&rc=1&cc=lby)
of people who have attempted to save their own lives:

> Fearing for their lives, given the targeting of Sub-Saharan Africans, and
> desperate to leave Libya, they had paid a human trafficker to take them to
> Egypt in a sealed and refrigerated truck.

The information agency of the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, _Irin News_ , reports the experience of some
[Somalis](http://www.irinnews.org/fr/ReportFrench.aspx?ReportID=92084) [fr].

> Their food reserves are almost totally exhausted, he explained, “The
> landlord did the shopping for us but we are missing a lot. We had a little
> bit of money when the troubles first erupted, but we are labourers and it
> has now been 12 days since we last worked.

Additionally, it is the women who have paid the heaviest price during this
conflict, Shamso Mohammed, a Somali refugee, told IRIN in the same article:

> The Somali women are particularly worried about what might happen. “I
> arrived here almost a year and a half ago in order to try to get myself to
> Europe, but so far I have not succeeded and now I find myself in the exact
> same situation I was trying to escape from by fleeing Somalia.”
>
> Maryan Ali, who lives under the same roof as Shamso, has said that she fears
> they may come and attack them in their homes. “The residencies of several
> Somalians would have been, in effect, the target of attackers”, she added.
>
> Three of her friends disappeared five days ago, she revealed. “We called
> them for work and they went; the last news we have of them is that they were
> taken by a car driven and accompanied by armoured men. We have no idea what
> the men have done to them and we have no one to turn to for help.”

Boukary Daou [wrote in an
article](http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=71886&intr=) published on
_Maliweb.net_ :

> On this Wednesday, (2nd March), there are around 134 migrants, who have
> trampled the soil of home. But this is just a small fraction of our
> compatriots living in Libya.
>
> According to the last administrative census carried out by the vocational
> electorate of the civil State, (Ravec) there are more than 9000 Malians
> still to be accounted for.

The site _Podcast Journal_ [signaled other sources of
worry](http://www.podcastjournal.net/Arrivee-de-milliers-d-etrangers-fuyant-
la-Libye_a7460.html) for the HCR and the OIM:

> Melissa Fleming, spokesperson of the HCR, made known to the HCR some
> concerns over the destiny of a ‘large number of refugees of Sub-Saharan
> African origin who are not yet authorised to enter into Tunisian territory.’
> This is an issue equally signalled as a concern by the spokesperson of the
> International Migration Organisation (OMI), Jemini Pandya, who also works to
> help with the evacuation process of non-Libyan nationals.

In another article by Carine Fouteau on Mediapart (reproduced on
[_Centrafrique Presse_](http://centrafrique-presse.over-blog.com/article-pour-
vous-dans-mediapart-68421063.html)), Jean-Phillipe Chauzy, spokesman of[
International Organisation of Migration
(IOM)](http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp), explains:

> Those who do not have any official papers are literally restricted over
> there. What’s more is that there are copious levels of people in this
> situation; from Mali, Guinea, Nigeria, Niger, Toga, Benin, Burkina Faso etc.
> Without a passport it is improbable that they would be authorised to leave
> the country. Their situation is a particularly pressing issue.
