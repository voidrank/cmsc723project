The first meeting of state parties to the [Convention on Cluster
Munitions](http://www.clusterconvention.org/) (CCM) which gathered 101
countries as well as numerous Non Governmental Organisations was held between
9th and 12th November in Vientiane, Laos. This conference followed the first
effort undertaken by the civil society which has heavily lobbied to make the
international community uphold the CCM. Adopted on 30 May 2008 in Dublin, [108
countries have already signed the CCM while 46 countries have ratified
it](http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/treatystatus/). Today, about [36
countries are affected by cluster
bombs](http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/the-problem/countries/) which are
still widely produced, used, and stockpiled.

Anna MacDonald, head of Control Arms campaign,
[reminds](http://blogs.oxfam.org/en/blog/10-11-11-laos-worlds-most-bombed-
country) on _Oxfam International Blogs_ why Laos hosts the CCM:

> We are all here for the First Meeting of States Parties to the **[Convention
> on Cluster Munitions](http://www.clusterconvention.org/index.php)** – which
> basically means the first annual meeting since the [cluster
> bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_bomb) treaty was agreed. It’s a
> very relevant location, as **more than 2 million tons of bombs were dropped
> on** **Laos** **during** **America** **’s “secret war” between 1964 and
> 1973**. At least **30% failed to detonate** , and decades later, **up to 80
> million cluster bomblets** lie undetonated across the country.

The aim of the CCM is of course to make cluster bombs’ production, use,
stockpiling and transfer banned in all countries of the world. Cluster bombs
are supposed to target military objectives but civilian facilities are often
killed and injured by these weapons. [According to the NGO Handicap
International](http://www.clusterbombs.us/documentation-center/), 98% of
recorded casualties associated with cluster bomb are civilians, and 27%
involves children. [In another
post](http://blogs.oxfam.org/en/blog/10-08-02-cluster-bombs-treaty-becomes-
international-law-years-campaigning-reap-results), Anna MacDonald stresses
that these weapons are [against the international humanitarian
law](http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/620):

> The ban on cluster bombs took 18 months to go through negotiation, although
> campaigners, activists and supportive governments had worked for many more
> years previously to ban these indiscriminate weapons. Cluster bombs are
> nasty, indiscriminate weapons that are hard to target and often lay
> unexploded on the ground for months, years and even decades after they were
> dropped. Children are particularly vulnerable potential victims, as they are
> attracted to these strange shiny little objects in the ground.

Vivian Tan, contributor on the blog _IntLawGrrls_ , [emphasizes the importance
of the CCM](http://intlawgrrls.blogspot.com/2009/05/critique-of-cluster-
munitions.html):

> The general prohibition in the Cluster Munitions Convention against the
> production, use, stockpiling, and transfer of cluster munitions represents a
> significant improvement upon the vague standards of the older Conventional
> Weapons Convention. The later treaty's mandate for the destruction of
> stockpiles is particularly important, as many countries have retained old
> cluster bombs dating as far back as the Cold War that have become highly
> unstable with age…This new treaty also sets specific deadlines for bomb
> clearance and destruction [countries are to destroy their stockpiles within
> eight years, and clear their territory of unexploded submunitions within 10
> years].
>
> In addition, the Cluster Munitions Convention addresses victims already
> injured. States parties are obligated to develop national plans to assist
> all victims affected by cluster bombs without discrimination…Also laudable
> are transparency measures and requirements for thorough reporting. Within
> 180 days after the treaty enters into force for a state party, the state
> must disclose to the United Nations information such as a description of its
> current stockpile, bomb clearance and destruction programs, known areas of
> contamination, and proposed plans to achieve the goals of the Cluster
> Munitions Convention.

In the same post, she also points out CCM’s significant omissions :

> First, the treaty only addresses cluster bombs dispensed by aircraft,
> leaving out those launched by submarines or on land. At the same time, the
> treaty gives a generic definition of cluster munitions that may result in an
> over-inclusive ban on more sophisticated models that do not cause the
> devastating humanitarian harm associated with the antiquated types.
>
> Disparity among the state parties’ capacities and ill-defined standards are
> also critical drawbacks. Where there exist no relevant international
> regulations, the Cluster Munitions Convention requires state parties to
> apply “any necessary national law” to achieve its goals and penalize non-
> compliance. This may result in significant inconsistencies in enforcement
> among state parties. The treaty is also unclear on who should monitor its
> implementation, such the use of trust funds or mediation of dispute
> settlements between state parties…State parties are also obligated to bear
> the costs incurred by the United Nations in enforcing transparency and
> compliance measures. The heavier burden will fall upon poorer nations, who
> may not have the resources to keep up with the strict compliance standards
> in the first place.  
>  The Cluster Munitions Convention has met resistance from major stockpilers
> like the United States, Russia, and China, because it does not take into
> account the military value of cluster munitions or the expensive nature of
> their clearance and destruction. The key players’ refusal to adopt the
> treaty diminishes other states’ incentives to join.

Bonnie Docherty, researcher at the NGO Human Right Watch,
[adds](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2010/08/01/cluster-munitions-
treaty-a-milestone-but-a-long-way-to-go/) on the blog _The UK Debate_ :

> A strong interpretation of the treaty also is important to maximize its
> humanitarian impact. While many of its provisions are clear, a few of its
> more controversial articles leave room for debate.
>
> Most notably, some countries contend that the treaty waives the ban on
> assistance with prohibited activities during joint military operations with
> countries that have not joined. But many others, and civil society groups,
> counter that the treaty cannot logically be interpreted to require countries
> that have joined to eliminate cluster munitions while permitting them to
> help another country use them.
>
> Finally, countries need to carry out their promises. Many have started by
> passing national implementation legislation and destroying stockpiles. But
> more such laws are needed. They should codify the convention’s obligations
> as well as its prohibitions.

On November 12, the [Vientiane
Declaration](http://www.clusterconvention.org/1msp/wp-
content/uploads/2010/08/DRAFT-DECLARATION.pdf) and the [Vientiane Action
Plan](http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/news/?id=2734), calling for concrete
actions against cluster bombs, have been adopted by the State Parties. During
the meeting, several countries – including New Zealand, Austria, Belgium or
Luxemburg notably – [announced a 30 million dollar
donation](http://laovoices.com/2010/11/15/vientiane-meeting-yields-concrete-
action-plan-for-cluster-bomb-
disposal/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+LaoVoices+\(Lao+Voices\))
for cluster bomb clearance in Laos through grant aid and NGO funding, while
Austria declared that the [destruction of its cluster bomb stockpiles has been
completed](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/11/15/Laos-declaration-on-
cluster-bombs-hailed/UPI-85931289855639/). But a lot has to be done. If
significant military powers, such as the United Kingdom, France or Germany,
have already signed and ratified the treaty, [the United
States](http://www.landmines.org/Page.aspx?pid=993), China, Russia or Israel –
the biggest stockpilers and users – are still reluctant to take the plunge.
Besides, the US army is accused of using cluster bombs last year as Amnesty
International uncovered a [cluster bomb
attack](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/yemen-images-missile-and-
cluster-munitions-point-us-role-fatal-attack-2010-06-04) in Yemen in December
2009. In 2008, [Russia used cluster
bombs](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/04/14/russiageorgia-cluster-bombs-harm-
shows-need-join-ban) during its trial of strength with Georgia. Meanwhile,
[Israel dropped 4 millions cluster bombs](http://www.handicap-
international.fr/en/around-the-world0/in-brief/cluster-bombs-continue-to-
claim-victims-in-
lebanon/index.html?dechi_programmes%5boffset%5d=150&cHash=271a21136a) during
the 2006 South Lebanon war. Next year, in September, Lebanon is scheduled to
host the next second meeting of State Parties to the Convention of Cluster
Munitions.
