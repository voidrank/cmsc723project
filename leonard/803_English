About 150 Uzbek children were infected with HIV in hospitals of
[Namangan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namangan), the third-largest city of
Uzbekistan. Although the incident was registered in 2007-08, the issue became
public only in March 2010, when the opposition-minded Ferghana.ru website
(blocked in Uzbekistan) [leaked](http://enews.ferghana.ru/article.php?id=2611)
a documentary [rus], which had been shot by the Uzbek TV following the order
of the prosecutor's office.

The film cites Bakhtiyor Shodmonov, a representative of the Prosecutor’s
Office in Namangan, [saying](http://www.ferghana.ru/news.php?id=14262) [rus]
that 14 of 147 infected children died (the documentary was shot in early
2009). He also said that 12 doctors and nurses from two hospitals in Namangan
were tried in court, found guilty of mistreatment of the children and
sentenced to 5-9 years in jail (see the film in Uzbek language
[here](http://static.video.yandex.ru/lite/ferghana-ru/0tm0cmerj7.2209)).

The news produced a big resonance in the blogosphere. Many people are shocked
not only with the negligence of doctors, but also with the fact that the case
was covered up by the government. Some even think that the sentence was not
severe enough. _Neoleo_ [writes](http://neoleo.livejournal.com/35262.html)

According to the Special Order of the Uzbek Ministry of Health, all hospitals
havingchildren and surgery departments must employ an epidemiologist. Director
of the children hospital in Namangan
[says](http://www.ferghana.ru/news.php?id=14262) in the documentary [rus] that
although the relevant position was presumed in the hospital, no one was
appointed to this job, although requests were sent to both city and provincial
epidemiological stations.

Another fact – imprisonment of healthcare activist Maksim Popov – also
reflects the government's attempts to conceal AIDS-related issues in
Uzbekistan. Independent online newspaper Uznews.net
[reported](http://uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=ru&cid=3&nid=12585) [rus]
that the Uzbek court has sentenced Maksim Popov, 28, a civil campaigner and
head of anti-AIDS nonprofit organization “Izis” to 7 years in prison. The
court has found that a brochure that he was distributing is allegedly
“incompatible with local traditions”.

The incident with Maksim confirms an [unofficial
ban](http://community.livejournal.com/lgbt_grani/374139.html) on distribution
of information about usage of condoms as prevention of HIV and AIDS that the
Uzbek authorities [rus] applied for NGOs and international organizations,
including UNICEF. Several days ago Aljazeera English aired a documentary film
“AIDS on the Heroin Road”. The film focuses on endemic corruption in state
apparatus and police forces as an important factor behind the spread of HIV in
Central Asia.
