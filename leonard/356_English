Serbian daily 'Alo' carries an image of Serbian mercenaries in Libya.

**Update (28 February, 2011):**

Two days after Global Voices published this story, the Serbian Ministry of
Defence issued a statement on 25 February, 2011, denying Serbian military
involvement to the Libyan civil unrest. Quoted in
[Reuters](http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/serbia-denies-military-
involvement-in-libya), the Defence Minister said,

“No active or retired Serbian military personnel were involved in the events
in Libya and we deny all such media reports.”

However Libyan anti-government website Libya al Youm [reported on 27 February,
2011](http://www.libya-alyoum.com/news/index.php/index.php?id=21&textid=2314),
that Serbian radio station BIR had reported airplanes from the Serbian
Republic carrying mercenaries to suppress demonstrators in Libya.

According to a Maltese blog [_Malta CC_](http://malta.cc/latest-news/rolling-
update-live-libya-2011/#more-3087), Serbian military pilots reportedly took
part in the bombing of protesters in the Libyan cities of Tripoli and
Benghazi. This claim was made public after two Libyan pilots fled to Malta,
refusing to bomb their fellow citizens participating in [the Libya
uprising](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/libya-
uprising-2011/).

Serbian daily _Alo_ reminded readers that [Muammar al-
Gaddafi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_al-Gaddafi) had hired Serbian
pilots before: in the 90s, in combat operations against radical Islamists, but
also in actions against civilians, in support of the ground forces.

[In the same
article](http://www.alo.rs/vesti/35945/Srpski_psi_rata_cuvaju_Gadafija), _Alo_
revealed that Serbian mercenaries were allegedly killing protesters in the
streets of Tripoli and Benghazi:

It appears that Serbian netizens are not too surprised by these allegations
and revelations. [Krstarica

rata%E2%80%9C-%C4%8Duvaju-Gadafija!?highlight=Gadafi) is one of the venues
rich in debate.

Neca 1977 asks:

Visitors on an ultra-right, white power forum
[“Stormfront”](http://www.stormfront.org/forum/t781918/) also spoke of the
alleged involvement of the Serbian “dogs of war” in Libya.
