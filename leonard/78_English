The unexpected declaration of a national state of emergency to deal with a
high rate of crime has taken citizens of Trinidad and Tobago by surprise. At a
press conference on the evening of Sunday 21 August, Prime Minister Kamla
Persad-Bissessar [announced](http://www.news.gov.tt/index.php?news=9020) that
“after much deliberation it has been agreed that Government will impose a
limited state of emergency in hot spots across the country.” This legal step,
which affects a broad range of civil rights, has triggered widespread debate
about the roots of violent crime in Trinidad and Tobago and the implications
of the government's latest strategy.

The state of emergency requires a presidential proclamation under conditions
specified in the Trinidad and Tobago constitution, as
[noted](http://www.knowtnt.com/node/336) by KnowTNT.com. It gives the
authorities special temporary legal powers to arrest and search citizens
without a warrant. It also imposes a curfew on the capital city, Port of
Spain, and its immediate suburbs, as well as the major urban centres of San
Fernando, Arima and Chaguanas, restricting residents to their homes between 9
pm and 5 am. Other [Emergency Powers

[PDF] affect [habeas corpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus) and
citizens’ rights to freedom of movement, assembly, association, speech, and
privacy.

Over the past decade, the murder rate in Trinidad and Tobago has increased
dramatically, fuelled by the rise of criminal gangs, the illegal drug trade,
and the widespread availability of illegal guns. Successive crime-prevention
plans, heavy investment in surveillance technology, and even the hiring of a
Canadian police commissioner have had little effect. In recent days, the
country was horrified by a series of murders — [11 in a four-day
period](http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/11_killed_since_Thursday-128165343.html).
Announcing the state of emergency, Persad-Bissessar said: “The current crime
spree dictates that more must be done and stronger action must be deployed
now…it must be a response that will hold the current spike in gang activity
and crime in general in the shortest possible time.”

Some Trinidadians online welcomed the government's strategy. “Regular readers
of this blog will know this is something I called for on many occasions and am
strongly in support of,” [said](http://www.jumbieswatch.com/2011/08/state-of-
emergency-declared.html) blogger Jumbie's Watch. “Many have been calling on
the government for firm and decisive action and like it or not, this is it,”
[noted](http://plainlytalking.blogspot.com/2011/08/pandora-consequence.html)
Plain Talk. On Twitter,
[@taramjohn](http://twitter.com/#!/taramjohn/status/105663560641822721)
declared her “support of the #stateofemergency #lockdown:

> Prefer be @ home by 9pm than feel unsafe in d country I live in. #patience

Others questioned the efficacy of a state of emergency, the implications for
civil rights, and the possibility of abuse of emergency by the authorities.

wryly noted:

[@tsaboca](http://twitter.com/#!/tsaboca/status/105624414946721792) asked:

> What happens if yuh enemies have police friends?

And [@fakekamla](http://twitter.com/#!/fakekamla/status/105484756350799872) —
a Twitter account satirically impersonating the prime minister — naturally
weighed in:

> Dengue still killing me. Slept all day and only just got up. Dreamt I
> declared a state of emergency and confused the shit out of everybody.

The economic effects of the state of emergency, and in particular the curfew,
also came under scrutiny. “If this country was a corporation, our share price
would be heading south just about now,”
[remarked](http://twitter.com/#!/30daysnFebruary/status/105458079457492992)
[@30daysnFebruary](http://twitter.com/#!/30daysnFebruary) via Twitter. “Poor
tourism industry,”
[said](http://twitter.com/#!/Track7Music/status/105708409629839360)
[@Track7Music](http://twitter.com/#!/Track7Music). “It was already in shambles
and making like what.. $10 a year…. Now its sure to be jus extinct.”

In the hours after the state of emergency was announced, many Trinidadians
were bewildered by an absence of reliable official information. The measures
were scheduled to take effect at midnight on 22 August, but the Emergency
Powers Regulations were not released until several hours later. An inaccurate
list of areas under curfew was circulated online and via mobile networks.

As is usually the case in Trinidad and Tobago's social media sphere, the
liveliest debate unfolded in the semi-privacy of Facebook, which was also a
channel for spreading news and rumours. Facebook user [Brendon J.
O'Brien](https://www.facebook.com/Jeremy4490) posted a note that attracted
several dozen responses (quoted with explicit permission from the writer):

> I, for one, am left wanting a much more serious explanation for such serious
> (or at least serious-sounding) measures. Mrs. Persad-Bissessar says that the
> current rate of crime proves that “government must respond to in the most
> definitive manner possible.” This would be completely understandable if it

> thief. This will shape how we respond to an elevated state of protective
> force, and should've been taken into consideration when this plan was coming
> together…. The end result in the next few days could only be confusion.

On Twitter, Trinidadians quickly adopted the hashtags #stateofemergency and
#stateofemergencytt. The curfew regulations — the aspect of the state of the
emergency most likely to affect regular citizens — came in for particular
attention. Comedian

[@AdVerse4490](http://twitter.com/#!/AdVerse4490/status/105648339420323840)
was more defiant:

[@oilandmusic76](http://twitter.com/#!/oilandmusic76/status/105668823222460417)
pointed out that the regulations were aimed at specific communities considered
to be gang “hotspots”:

[@ _Kavira_](http://twitter.com/#!/_Kavira_/status/105695843088203776)
expressed a widely held view:

added:

And writer B.C. Pires, who tweets from
[@ToBCorNotToBC](http://twitter.com/#!/ToBCorNotToBC/status/105737756772270080),
reacted to a statement by the acting commissioner of police that the media are
not considered an “essential service” for the purpose of issuing curfew
passes:

> Why would anyone think journalists are essential in a state of emergency?
> You don't want people to find out what you're doing, do you?
>
> If you allowed journalists to cover your police beatings, intimidatory
> arrests etc, what would be the point of a state of emergency?

One commenter at Trinidad and Tobago News Blog
[suggested](http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/blog/?p=5569&cpage=1#comment-38681)
the state of emergency may also have something to do with current negotiations
between the government and the main public service union, which have included
threats of a general strike:

> All to avoid civil unrest due to industrial action, not human rights…. What
> is really happening? Let us not be emotional but objective. This move will
> stop the labour movement in their tracks first and foremost before it
> addresses any criminal elements!

Meanwhile, developments in Trinidad and Tobago attracted attention elsewhere
in the Caribbean region, where other nations have struggled to control levels
of crime and violence. Writing from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, blogger
Abeni [questioned](http://hairoun.blogspot.com/2011/08/no-kamla-no.html) the
wisdom of the Persad-Bissessar government's actions:

> While I agree that escalating violence in the region is cause for great
> concern this move strikes me as being panicky, ill thought out and silly. It
> may be that there will be some short term gain but when this limited
> emergency is lifted I am sure it will be business as usual. So rather than
> place limited state of emergencies and interfere with people's basic rights
> Caribbean leaders better sit down and identify what is driving this upsurge
> of violence in their respective islands.
