As global food prices [continue to remain
high](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9MEO0SG0.htm), with
potential increases on the horizon because of [soaring oil prices and supply
concerns](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/07/us-food-fao-
idUSTRE7360AF20110407), experts says there is one often-overlooked solution
for fighting hunger: women.

**Gender gap**

Women are vital to food production in many developing countries, making up on
average 43 percent of the agricultural labor force. Some estimate that [80
percent
](http://www.wfp.org/Our%20work/Preventing%20Hunger/Focus%20on%20women/Women4Women%20overview)of
those involved in farming in Africa and 60 percent in Asia are women.

At the Envision forum last week in New York City, during a panel focused on
women's roles in alleviating hunger and poverty, United Nations Development
Programme Under-Secretary General and Associate Administrator Rebeca Grynspan
said:

> Even talking only about the rural areas, women produce 50 percent of the
> food of the world. They receive only 1 percent of the credit but they
> produce 50 percent of the food.

In addition to a lack of recognition, a [report released last
month](http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e00.htm) from the United
Nation's (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization says that while female
farmers’ roles may vary across regions, they consistently have less access to
resources and opportunities than their male counterparts. Closing this gender
gap could lift as many as 150 million people out of hunger.

Ma. Estrella A. Penunia, posting on the website of the Asian Farmers
Association for Sustainable Rural Development, lists [six key
reasons](http://asianfarmers.org/?p=1243%E2%80%9D) why we should care about
female farmers, including food security issues. Meanwhile, Emily Oakley, a
United States (U.S.) farmer who has studied small-scale farming in dozens of
countries, reflects in a post on the blog _In Her Field_ on [women in
agriculture](http://inherfield.com/2011/01/31/guest-post-women-in-farming-
around-the-world/):

> In most places I have visited, women are more than just supporters of
> agriculture; they partner with their husbands in day-to-day tasks, decision-
> making, and planning. In Kenya, it is far more typical to see a woman by
> herself with a child strapped on her back turning up a field with a hoe in
> hand than it is to see her joined by her husband. In a remote village of
> Western Nepal (the kind of remote that means half a day’s walk to the
> nearest road), the farmer everyone in town agreed was most innovative was a
> woman. Her farm stood out on the hillside as an oasis of growth and
> diversity where other farms were experiencing soil erosion and poor yields.
> I recently participated in a farmer-to-farmer project in the Dominican
> Republic focusing on women farmers in commercial hoop house production of
> bell peppers. This is just the tiniest taste of women’s work in agriculture.

**Food for the whole family**

Many women work as subsistence farmers, small-scale entrepreneurs, unpaid
workers or casual wage laborers. Giving these women the same tools and
resources as men, including better access to financial services, technical
equipment, land, education and markets, could increase agricultural production
in developing countries by 2.5 to 4 percent, according to the UN report. These
production gains could, in turn, reduce the number of hungry people by 12 to
17 percent, or by 100 to 150 million people. There were roughly 925 million
undernourished people globally in 2010.

Empowering women could also improve food security for their entire family,
says the report, because women are more likely than men to spend additional
income on food, education and other basic household needs. But Dipendra
Pokharel, a researcher in Nepal, says on his blog that women's roles in the
home can also mean their needs [get
overlooked](http://dipokharel.blogspot.com/2011/03/womens-role-in-achieving-
food.html):

> Women farmers often have different priorities than their male counterparts,
> and this can, in many cases, be related to their direct role in feeding
> their family. In the rural areas of Nepal, traditionally men control the
> outside world and women the inside of the home. Such traditional
> perspectives can contribute to the lop-sidedness of ‘gender blind’
> information, collected by outsiders with the intention of helping a
> community. It is usually the men who provide information to the outsiders.
> This means that women’s priorities are often overlooked, unless they are
> specifically taken into account. This also supports the view that the female
> farmers receive less extension services which are needed to transform their
> subsistence-based farming system to a more commercial one.

Female farmers operate smaller farms than male farmers, on average only half
to two-thirds as large, according to the report, and their farms usually have
lower yields. They are also less likely to own land or have access to rented
land. The report shows, for example, that women represent fewer than 5 percent
of all agricultural holders in West Asia and North Africa.

Jane Tarh Takang, who has worked with farmers in West and Central Africa,
discusses [ land rights issues](http://blog.cifor.org/2011/03/03/gender-
continues-to-be-major-issue-in-africa/) in an interview by Edith Abilogo
posted on _FORESTSBlog_ , the blog of The Center for International Forestry
Research:

> In most communities in Africa, women and girls have very limited access to
> property and land compared with boys and men. Without land, they cannot
> produce resources to feed their family or generate income, and this results
> in extending the poverty cycle to their children. This situation is worse
> when it comes to widows or unmarried women…In cases where the existing
> farmlands have been depleted due to unsustainable agricultural practices,
> men would prefer to reserve the fertile areas for their own use and leave
> the less fertile ones to the women.

Elfinesh Dermeji, an Ethiopian female farmer who attended the Workshop on
Gender and Market-Oriented Agriculture in Addis Ababa earlier this year, says
in a post on the _New Agriculturist_ that it is [not always
easy](http://www.new-ag.info/en/pov/views.php?a=1902#s1) to get women involved
in agriculture:

> In some families when the men are positive and they want their wives to
> participate, the woman is not business oriented or she's not motivated. On
> the other side there are some men, when women are motivated and they want to
> participate, they don't want her to leave the house. They would rather not
> have that income than have their wife involved in an association.

**A search for solutions**

Still, numerous projects globally are involving female farmers, from
encouraging women in Ghana to [buy
tractors](http://whatgives365.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/women-tractors-a-love-
story/) to lobbying the Philippines government to [allow the wife's
name](http://asianfarmers.org/?p=1243) on land titles to [increasing the use
of information and communication
technologies](http://agriculture.gbiportal.net/2011/03/08/rural-women-farmers-
in-uganda-increasing-their-use-of-icts/) among Ugandan farmers.

On _OneWorld South Asia_ , Ananya Mukherjee-Reed describes how 250,000
Kudumbashree members, a network of 3.7 million women in the Indian state of
Kerala, have [formed farming
collectives](http://southasia.oneworld.net/weekend/food-security-as-if-women-
mattered-a-story-from-kerala) to jointly lease and cultivate land:

> ‘As farmers, now we control our own time, resources and labour,’ was the
> refrain I heard over and over again. Dhanalakhsmi, a young woman in
> Elappully, tells me that the change in her role from a labourer to producer
> has had a profound effect on her children. ‘They see me differently now.
> When we are at meetings discussing our farms, our incomes, or simply sharing
> our problems, they watch with a lot of interest.’

But bloggers say more can be done. In a post on _Solutions_ , Yifat Susskind
argues that the U.S. should [buy crops from local African
farmers](http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/911) as part of their foreign
aid. Dipendra Pokharel says rural women must gain [social and political
space](http://dipokharel.blogspot.com/2011/03/womens-role-in-achieving-
food.html) in private and public domains. Melissa McEwan, blogging on
_Shakesville_ in the U.S., challenges the misconception that only men are
farmers by compiling almost [100 photos of female farmers
worldwide](http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/10/female-
farmers.html). The report says changes are also needed at the policy level.

Whatever the approach, Ma. Estrella A. Penunia says to truly succeed it should
[be inclusive](http://asianfarmers.org/?p=1243):

> As farming in many developing countries is a family endeavor, the one
> important thing also that can greatly help women farmers is the support that
> they will get from their husbands and male leaders /members of their
> organizations. In households where both the man and the woman have been
> sensitized to the dynamics of gender and believe in equal rights and
> opportunities, the full potentials of a woman farmer are harnessed to the
> fullest.
