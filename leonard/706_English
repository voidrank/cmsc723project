Nepali Prime Minister _[Madhav Kumar
Nepal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhav_Kumar_Nepal)_ announced his
resignation yesterday [in a live televised
speech](http://beacononline.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/nepal-nepal-pm-announces-
resignation-to-end-deadlock/).

Mr. Nepal took charge in May 2009 after his predecessor
[Prachanda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prachanda) (Pushpa Kumar Dahal), the
CPN (Maoist) leader, resigned over a conflict with the president over the
dismissal of the army's chief of staff following a dispute over the
integration of the former Maoist rebels into the national army.

Mr. Nepal's resignation should end a political stalemate in the country which
intensified after the coalition government failed to promulgate the new
constitution by May 28, 2010 and [extended the
term](http://blog4mynepal.blogspot.com/2010/06/nepal-constituent-assembly-
extension.html) of the Constituent assembly by one year.

_Gopal Sharma_ at _Reuters Blog_ [has some
backgrounds](http://blogs.reuters.com/gopal-sharma/2010/07/01/qa-nepal-power-
struggle-intensifies-after-pm-quits/) on the dispute:

> Nepal currently has no parliament and a special constituent assembly elected
> in 2008 to draft a new constitution doubles as the national legislature.
>
> No political party commands a majority in the assembly dominated by the
> Maoists. Any government’s primary responsibility is to oversee the drafting
> of the new constitution, the first after Nepal abolished the 239-year-old
> monarchy two years ago.
>
> Neither the Maoists nor other political parties can garner the two-thirds
> majority in the assembly required to pass the statue without the support of
> each other. Therefore, every one talks about a national unity government –
> one based on the consensus and participation all or most of the 25 political
> parties, including the Maoists, to ensure the writing of the constitution by
> the stipulated time of May next year.

_NepaleseAbroad.com_ is [furious about this
resignation](http://www.nepaleseabroad.com/2010/07/nepalese-prime-minister-
madhav-kumar-nepal-resigns/):

> Maoist wants the place and the Prime Minister-ship which they abandoned few
> months ago. This is complete childish behavior of the Maoists and their

> Every political parties of Nepal individually or collectively, whether they
