Indian novelist, essayist and activist [Arundhati
Roy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Roy) has more often been
highlighted in media not for her writing but because of her outspoken
criticism against the Indian state. Since her Booker prize winner novel [The
God of Small Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things),
she has devoted herself mainly to nonfiction and politics voicing issues
related to social justice and economic inequality.

Her support for Kashmiri separatism has recently stirred a debate across
India. She was speaking at a conference titled “Whither Kashmir- Freedom or
Enslavement?” organized by JKCCS in Srinagar on October 24, 2010. Roy said,
“[Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. It is a historical
fact](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article847323.ece).” Here is a
video of that speech uploaded in Youtube by

_Salil Tripathi_ at _Index On Censorship_ Blog
[summarizes](http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2010/10/india-arundhati-roy-
kashmir-pakistan-sedition/) reactions of the Indians:

> If sentiments expressed on the Internet — through Twitter and Facebook — are
> an indicator, her remarks have outraged many Indians. Some want her to be
> sent away to jail for a long time. One even tweeted that she should face
> capital punishment, although the maximum punishment under the sedition law
> is life imprisonment. For its part, the government has not said it will
> prosecute Roy, although a lawmaker of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
> Party from the northern state of Uttarkhand has filed an official complaint,
> which could set the stage for some legal action.

Along-with Indian media, the Indian blogosphere has exploded with reactions
for and against her statement. _Rajan Venkateswaran_ thinks that freedom of
speech should be within limits and
[writes](http://rajanvenkateswaran.blogspot.com/2010/10/freedom-of-speech-
yesbut-within-limits.html):

> It is sad that Government decided not to prosecute her. I really wish
> someone would file a PIL and the Supreme Court put her in a slammer, and
> make an example for others of her ilk.

_Travails and Travels_
[criticizes](http://indiegenous.blogspot.com/2010/10/roy-of-joke.html) Roy's
stance:

> Is there injustice in India? Yes. Corruption? Yes. Favoritism, Nepotism,
> Communalism, Criminal behavior, Oppression? Yes, Yes, Yes…. But, India is
> not bad as you make it sound to be. You make it sound as though a bunch of
> upper class elite wake up every morning with a JD that says, “prey on the
> poorest of the poor, rape a few adivasis, oppress a few more, trample on
> human rights with an attention to detail.”

_Chinmay Kumar_
[defends](http://chinmayblackbird.blogspot.com/2010/10/predicament-of-being-
arundhati-roy.html) Arundhati Roy:

> Did she misuse freedom of speech? May be, may not be. If it stirs political
> disaster then it is of course a misuse. Kashmir has always been a
> catastrophic political issue, starting from the day of freedom if India. Her
> statement was enough to cause hullabaloo as India has been protecting
> Kashmir for a long time, which she stated as the colonialism of the country.
> [..]
>
> There are voices that will rise again and again and there will be attempts
> to crash them. That happened hundreds of years ago and few decades ago. From
> Socrates to Suu-Kyi and today Arundhati Roy.

_K.R. Surendran_ from Kerala
[informs](http://surendrankr.blogspot.com/2010/10/arundhati-roy-haunted-
writer.html):

> Arundhati Roy has made a statement pitying the attitude of our nation for
> speaking out without fear and she has made it clear that whatever she said
> is out of love for our nation. Listen leaders…….

_Rahul Basu_ at _As I please_ [disagrees](http://rahul-
basu.blogspot.com/2010/10/sedition-and-roy.html) with virtually everything
that Arundhati Roy says or writes, however, he opines:

> Is her speech worthy of a case of sedition being slapped on her? I am
> astounded that there has been so much discussion about this issue in the
> media.

Blogger and writer _Dilip D'Souza_ at _Death Ends Fun_ [concludes in his post
on this issue](http://dcubed.blogspot.com/2010/10/about-sedition.html):

> I urge you too to get used to the idea that there are people who disagree
> profoundly with things you believe and hold dear.
>
> Yes, that includes Kashmir. Get used to it.
>
> And that there exist those differing views, that they are expressed, does
> not by any means equate to sedition. It is instead the definition of being
> Indian. Get used to that too.
