Since becoming independent in 1991, Ukraine has seen several waves of
emigration, with the numbers gradually declining after the early 1990s.
Nevertheless, according to Migration Information Source, the share of those
choosing to leave for the West continues to
[increase](http://www.migrationinformation.org/USFocus/display.cfm?ID=365)
[ENG].

With the country hit hard by the recent economic crisis and most citizens
[disillusioned](http://rus.newsru.ua/ukraine/23feb2011/popop.html) [RUS] with
Ukrainian politicians and disappointed with the overall economic and political
situation, more and more discussions about emigration alternatives have been
appearing online.

About half a year ago, Yevgeniy R. created a website called [_Party of the
Positive Pessimists_](http://papope.com/index1.html) [RUS], in order to gather
and publish stories of those who have recently decided to leave Ukraine. He
[claims](http://blogpost-ua.com/2011/02/pokidaya-ukrainu/) [RUS] that, since
its launch, the site has had over 20,000 visitors, about 200 people have sent
in their stories, and over 100 of them have been published.

Below is a concise translation of the
[answers](http://papope.com/blog/?page_id=824) [RUS] that the website users
provided to the crucial questions facing future emigrants:

**You do realize that there [abroad] you would be a second-rate citizen,
right?**

**Why have you decided that it would be better for you THERE?**

**Is it easier and quicker to make money and develop your business in
developing countries (including Ukraine) than in the developed ones?**

Blogger Victor Ronin ( _victorronin.com_ ) provided the following list of
arguments [RUS]:

> It is easier to conduct business in Ukraine because:
>
> You may conduct business in your native language (applies to everyone who
> has been born on the territory of the ex-USSR);
>
> There are enough acquaintances and/or connections (again, for those born
> [here]);
>
> Competition in some areas is not as strong as in the developed countries
> yet, because the market is still quite “raw”;
>
> There are possibilities to get around the law. (Although it helps only those
> who are willing and ready to breach the law);
>
> Access to cheap labor force.
>
> [Counter] arguments:
>
> Horrible legislative, executive and judiciary authorities (and, as a result,
> [Ukraine] is one of the least attractive places for business activity);
>
> It is extremely difficult to access start-up capital (investments);
>
> Presence of the off-market competition;
>
> The worst infrastructure;
>
> Long-term investment is difficult (because of the problems with corruption
> and change of government).

User Ruslan [listed](http://papope.com/blog/?p=933) [RUS] things he has lost
and gained by moving to Sweden:

> 1\. […] I have lost my own, quite successful, business. And exchanged it for
> an average post of a hired employee. Maybe a top one, but still just an
> employee.
>
> 2\. I’ve lost approximately 4,000-5,000 Euro […] per month in exchange for
> 2,000 after taxes […].
>
> 3\. I’ve lost an opportunity to “solve [problems]” with money. It’s a
> questionable loss, since usually you had to pay for something that someone
> had [a duty] to do anyway […]. In Sweden, I cannot “solve [problems].” I
> mean, [problems] would be solved as much as they have to. As a rule, not
> less and not more than that. Plus, I don’t need to solve 90% of those issues
> I had to deal with in Ukraine. There’s no running around various
> institutions, collecting papers. […]
>
> 4\. I’ve lost an opportunity to frequently visit my friends and loved ones
> in person. Actually, I haven’t been doing it that often in Ukraine, since
> work took a lot of time, [I] had to work 10-16 hours a day. So, for someone
> this loss would be more significant, but for me it’s not that big. My
> mother, an elderly woman, learned to use Skype and we communicate
> wonderfully via video-calls. This is, of course, not a personal presence,
> but with frequent communication you stop feeling it. Same with friends.
>
> 5\. I’ve lost the theoretical possibility of “haltura” [moonlighting], which
> for many of my fellow countrymen has been a very practical one. While owning
> a company I did not need to [do work on the side], my employees have been
> doing it and I used to close my eyes on it. Because, seven years before, I

> where that money has come from.
>
> In return, I have gained […]:
>
> Peace and confidence in tomorrow.
>
> An opportunity to receive free and high-quality education, as well as
> reasonably paid higher education for children.
>
> Social security. Truly free medical services in all cases of serious

Currently, Ukraine “[has one of the world’s 30 highest levels of brain
drain](http://www.prosperity.com/country.aspx?id=UP)” [ENG], and [the number
of its labor migrants](http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/40161/)
[ENG] was around 4.5 million people in 2009.
