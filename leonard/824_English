In Costa Rica, the issue of same-sex relationships has been an active topic
for the past several years, but little progress has been made in terms of
establishing an official policy. In a country with [Roman Catholicism as the
official Constitutional
religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica#Religion) and with a large
majority conservative population, it has been a controversial topic with
supporters and opponents on both sides of the issue.

After several attempts to bring the issue to the legislative level, the most
recent proposal called Coexistence Societies, which can be read
[here](http://www.movimientodiversidad.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17:proyecto-
de-ley-de-sociedades-de-convivencia-ultimo&catid=10:varios) in Spanish, does
not seek to legalize same-sex marriage, but seeks to offer alternatives for
these couples. The text is[ based on four basic points

con-urgencia-proyecto%20-on-sociedadades-of-
living?%20utm_source%20=%20twitter%20twitterfeed%20&%20utm_medium%20=), which
include hospital visitation rights, dividing of earned wealth, inheritance
rights, and insurance options.

During the presidential campaign, Laura Chinchilla of the National Liberation
Party (PLN), who was elected on February 7, 2010 promised to support same-sex
unions as an alternative to marriage, as she expressed in this [video
[es]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d535cdzME80&feature=player_embedded).
However, shortly after she was elected and after meetings with Assembly
deputies from the Christian-aligned parties and with Evangelical Christian
leaders, she [hardened her position towards the proposal of same-sex unions
[es].](http://wvw. nacion.com/ln_ee/2010/febrero/19/pais2273738.html)

Reactions to this change in position by President-elect Chinchilla were quick.
The blogger at _Conejos Suicidas [es]_[writes](http://conejos-
suicidas.ticoblogger.com/2010/02/chinchilla-miente-e-incumple-primer.html):

> Si le fue tan fácil cambiar de opinión en este tema, ¿qué tan firme y
> honesta resultará al tener que cumplir compromisos con fracciones y grupos
> de poder más fuertes?

If it was so easy to change your opinion on this subject, how strong and
honest will it result in having to fulfill commitments with stronger fractions
and groups in power?

Another strong critic on her change in position is the blogger known as El
Chamuko, [who writes on his
blog](http://infierno.ticoblogger.com/2010/02/laurias-la-mujer-sin-palabra-y
-sin.html) _Infierno en Costa Rica [es]_ :

> Habló muy lindo Laurias, de que no hay que discriminar a los homosexuales y
> que hay que apoyar iniciativas diferentes al matrimonio para proteger los
> derechos de esta minoría. El proyecto de ley de uniones civiles entre
> homosexuales es una iniciativa DIFERENTE AL MATRIMONIO, pero ahora la
> marioneta cambia el discurso que se traía en campaña, solo por quedar bien
> con un par de fanáticos religiosos que no permiten pecadores en sus
> partidos, pero bien que apoyan a ex-convictos por pedofilia.

Laurias* (Laura Chinchilla) spoke very nice, that we should not discriminate
against homosexuals and the need to support initiatives different to marriage
to protect the rights of this minority. The law proposal about gay civil
unions is an initiative DIFFERENT TO MARRIAGE, but now the “puppet” changes
the speech that she made during the campaign, only to look good with a pair of
religious fanatics that do not allow sinners in their parties, but supports
pedophile ex-convicts.

_*Note: “Laurias” is a nickname that some bloggers gave to the elected
president Laura Chinchilla, that combines her name with the surname of the
outgoing president Oscar Arias, because she had his support during the
campaign. She is also called Arias’ puppet because she will continue with the
actual government policies._

There are citizen groups that have proposed holding a referendum to let the
people decide whether or not to approve the Law of Coexistence Societies. This
proposal to hold the referendum has outraged some bloggers and social sectors
of the country, and even some Assembly deputies like Ana Helena Chacón (PUSC),
Jose Merino (FA) and Carlos Gutierrez (ML), who have called for the law to be
convened in an extraordinary session of the Legislative Assembly. Many feel
that a referendum should not be held on a matter of Human Rights, which is
what many proponents of the law feel is what at stake.

Jorge of the blog _Terrorista Tercermundista [es]_ (Third World Terrorist)
[writes](http://terroristatercermundista.ticoblogger.com/2010/02/matrimonio-
gay-referendum.html):

> Dejar que la mayoría tome la decisión de si aceptar o no derechos básicos de
> una minoría en pleno año 2010, es insultar y escupir todas aquellas luchas
> que han librado los grupos siempre discriminados históricamente, y no solo
> me refiero a los homosexuales.

To allow the majority to make the decision whether or not to accept the basic
rights of a minority in the year 2010, is insulting and spits on all those
struggles that all historically discriminated groups have fought so long
against, and I do not only refer to homosexuals.

In the blog _Club Sodoma [es]_ , LGBT rights activist Willop [writes](http: /
/ club-sodoma.blogspot.com/2010/02/urgente-referendum-oscar-arias-laura.html):

> ¿Por qué debemos evitar el referéndum? Los derechos humanos fueron
> concebidos para respetarse y otorgársele a tod@s l@s ciudadan@s. Nuestro
> país consultaría si se da o no un derecho humano, eso debería ser
> inconcebible. Los derechos humanos no se consultan, se dan.

Why should we avoid the referendum? Human rights were meant to be respected
and granted to all citizens. For our country to consult whether or not a human
right should be given, that should be inconceivable. Human rights should not
be consulted, they are given.

One suggestion for resolving this matter in the best possible manner is made
by Cristian Cambronero on his blog _Fusil de Chispas [es]_ , [who
proposes](http://www.fusildechispas.com/2010/02/el-referendo-que-no-debe-ser):

> ¿Cuál es la alternativa al referendo? Simple: que el proyecto sea discutido
> en la Asamblea Legislativa, como corresponde, donde tras múltiples
> modificaciones ya cuenta con un apoyo expreso significativo.

What is the alternative to the referendum? Simple: that the proposal be
discussed in the Legislative Assembly, as it corresponds, where after many
changes it already has a significant explicit support.
