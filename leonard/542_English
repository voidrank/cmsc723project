Bloggers and cyber talking heads are speculating whether Fiji’s military
government sent the local head of Fiji Water back to the United States.

A government spokeswoman
[confirmed](http://www.fijilive.com/news/2010/11/19/28773.Fijilive) that the
water company’s head of external affairs, David Roth, left on a plane to Los
Angeles Thursday night (Fiji time), but would not elaborate on his departure.
Fiji’s military leader, Frank Bainimarama, is in China until next week and the
spokeswoman said he will address the situation when he returns.

Two days before Roth left, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, Fiji’s minister of Defense and
Immigration, resigned from the government, claiming differences stemming from
the Roth affair. Rumors are flying that Ganilau, who is a personal friend of
Roth and his family, refused to sign deportation orders for the Fiji Water
executive.

Ganilau has told media outlets that he resigned willingly and that differences
existed between him and the government regarding David Roth. But he would not
[elaborate](http://www.fijilive.com/news/2010/11/18/28767.Fijilive) further.

Fiji Water began bottling in 1996 in the Yaqara Valley in northern Viti Levu,
Fiji’s largest and most populated island. One year later, it began exporting
the water to the United States. Today, the company has a loyal – if not
affluent – following and consumers can find Fiji Water in more than 40
countries. According to its own numbers, Fiji Water
[generates](http://www.fijiwater.com/giving-back/community/economic-
contributions/) roughly 20 percent of Fiji’s export income and employs 350
people locally.

The Australian newspaper
[speculates](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/the-head-of-one-of-
the-countrys-biggest-exporters-has-been-asked-to-
leave/story-e6frg6nf-1225955979039) Roth was may have been expelled by Fiji’s
military government which wants to make the position local or perhaps even
attempt to access the aquifer where Fiji Water draws its product.

So far, no proof of Roth’s alleged expulsion has surfaced. Nor has any news
relating to further government action. TheMax, a commenter on the blog _Coup
4.5_ ,

If Roth was actually deported,

Tonight.html) Alohabula1 in _Fiji Board Exiles_ , then the government may have
made a major public relations blunder.

More than two years ago Fiji’s government tried to bring about a 20 cent per
litre tax on Fiji Water, but the motion was defeated in cabinet after a
lengthy fight. Rumors then persisted the water bottler threatened to cease
production if the government went ahead with the tax.
