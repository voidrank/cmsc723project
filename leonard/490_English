In the end of November, the city of Sao Paulo hosted the [1st Symposium On
Indigenous Uses of the Internet](http://www.usp.br/nhii/simposio/) [pt], an
event organized by the Center for Indigenous History and Indigenous Studies at
the Federal University of Sao Paulo to assess how indigenous communities were
using the internet in Brazil.

Delegates of 16 indigenous ethnicities from many parts of the country attended
the event, the majority of whom have already been using the Internet to seek
improvements for their people. Bringing the experience of an indigenous people
that [has benefited most](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/14/brazil-
the-indigenous-the-internet-and-interculturality/) from digital technologies
to promote political action, Almir Surui Narayamoga, leader of the [Paiter
Surui People](http://www.paiter.org/index_en.shtml), considered this debate of
the [utmost importance](http://chsurui.blogspot.com/2010/12/uso-de-internet-
pelas-comunidades.html) [pt] for everyone:

> A internet tem grande importância na luta social e ambiental dos povos
> indígenas.

The Internet plays an important role in the social and environmental struggles
of indigenous peoples.

During the three-day symposium, each delegate shared their experiences using
the Internet in the villages, for many and varied purposes: to promote events,
surveillance of their territories, distance learning, cultural exchange, birth
registration, claiming national insurance benefits, communication with
relatives, complaints, etc.

As expected, the event was covered by several bloggers from the audience.
Daniel, representing the Baniwa people, one of the people living in the
Amazonas state, summed up [the first day of the
symposium](http://baniwaonline.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/o-primeiro-dia-de-
simposio-sobre-internet-na-usp/) [pt] on the _Baniwaonline_ blog:

> Um momento bom pois tivemos a primeira oportunidade de nos conhecemos e
> saber o que cada um estava fazendo, como, onde, quais suas principais
> dificuldades, avanças, projetos em execução e projetos futuros (sonhos),
> ações relacionados ao uso de internet.

We had a good time because it was our first opportunity to meet each other and
know what everyone else has been doing, how, where, what difficulties they
mainly face, progress, ongoing projects and future plans (dreams), actions
related to the use of the Internet.

The event went on with the identification of the [challenges to be
overcome](http://www.indiosonline.org.br/novo/simposio-web-indigena/) [pt], as
detailed by the _Indios Online_ team:

> Existem no entanto vários problemas que foram levantados, como a dificuldade
> de conexão, problemas com a antena Gesac, falta de computadores,
> computadores quebrados, falta de manutenção desses computadores, falta de
> qualificação para que nós mesmo façamos a manutenção das maquinas nas
> aldeias.
>
> Esperamos que unidos possamos estar minimizando estes problemas, que nós da
> Rede Índios on Line conhecemos tão bem. A Internet nas aldeias não mata a
> cultura indígena se o seu uso for consciente e com um propósito definido.
> Hoje nós indígenas utilizamos esta Tecnologia que não pertence à nossa
> cultura como uma ferramenta de buscar melhorias para nossas comunidades e
> lutar por nossos direitos.

Several issues were raised, such as connection difficulties, problems with the
antenna provided by Gesac [the government's program for social and digital
inclusion], lack of computers, broken computers, lack of machinery
maintenance, lack of training so that we carry maintenance ourselves on the
computers in the villages.

We hope that together we can be minimizing these problems; we at Indios Online
network know them so well. Having the Internet in villages does not kill the
indigenous culture when it is used is a conscious manner and with a definite
purpose. Today we, indigenous people, use this technology that is alien to our
culture as a tool to seek improvements for our communities and to fight for
our rights.

At the close of the symposium, the participants agreed to advise the
indigenous peoples or individuals who do not use the Internet yet to create
their own blogs and websites, and decided on the creation of a special corner
of cyberspace for indigenous communities. _Baniwaonline_ summarises the last
day of the event and [highlights the decisions
taken](http://baniwaonline.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/3%C2%BA-e-ultimos-dia-do-
simposio-e-encaminhamentos-finais/) [pt]:

> Dentre os principais encaminhamentos, foi decidido em unanimidade dos
> participantes do evento, a necessidade de criar “Rede das Redes dos povos
> Indígenas”, usuarios (sites, bloogs, …), com a proposta de nome: “Rede
> Digital e culturas Indígenas”, em que os internautas indígenas se cadstrarão
> e divulgarão, neste site, os diversos conteúdos postados nos sites e blogs
> hoje existente e o que virao a ser criadas de diferentes lugares do Brasil.
> Uma forma de unir a força e trabalhar em conjunto em prol da sociedade
> indígena, disseminando expericnias, noticias, cursos e etc.

Among the main decisions, unanimously decided by the event's participants, was
the need of creating a “Network of Networks of Indigenous Peoples,” users
(sites, blogs…), with the proposed name: “Indigenous Cultures Digital Network”
a website of which the indigenous Internet users will be members and gather
the various content posted in the existing websites and blogs and those which
will be created in different parts of Brazil. [It is] a way to join forces and
work together to support indigenous peoples, share experiences, news, courses
and so on.

This future network of networks, which aims to bring all indigenous sites and
blogs together into a single portal, is expected to be launched at [Campus
Party Brazil 2011](http://www.campus-party.com.br/2011/index.html) [pt]. The
_Indios Online_ website explains [the goals of this new
network](http://www.indiosonline.org.br/novo/rede-das-redes/) [pt] and
publishes the [minutes of the
symposium](http://www.indiosonline.org.br/novo/ata-do-1%C2%BA-simposio-
indigena-sobre-usos-da-internet-no-brasil/) [pt]:

> […] a intenção é de dar visibilidade as ações digitais dos povos indígenas,
> e com isso mostrar para o mundo que nós indígenas temos sim capacidade e
> habilidade, de lidar com as diversas áreas do mundo digital.

[…] The aim is to give visibility to digital action of indigenous peoples, and
thereby show the world that we indeed have know-how and the skills to deal
with the various parts of the digital world.
