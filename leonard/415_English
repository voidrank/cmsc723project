To the dismay of Egyptians, world citizens and Egyptologists everywhere, the
famous Cairo [Egyptian
Museum](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Egyptian_Museum) was
vandalized and looted on Friday January 28, as the government imposed a curfew
and police abandoned their posts.

The museum is located on Tahrir Square at the heart of Cairo protests. Vandals
climbed the walls and stole or broke many precious artifacts as they rummaged
the remains of the tombs of ancient pharaohs looking for gold.

Taking matters into their own hands, citizens patrolled the museum and formed
a human wall against the looting of historic artifacts. As

Margaret Maitland, an Egyptologist at Oxford University, has identified some
of the damaged pieces on her blog [_The Eloquent
Peasant_](http://www.eloquentpeasant.com/2011/01/29/statues-of-tutankhamun-
damagedstolen-from-the-egyptian-museum/). In updates to one post (with more
than 80 comments) over several days, she has gone through pictures from Al
Jazeera and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/el-
amiro21/sets/72157625902989604/with/5398533268/) and placed them alongside
photos of how pieces originally appeared intact. “Tragic” and “devastating”
are just some of the word she uses to describe what has been lost:

> I’ve now identified the smashed wooden boat as also belonging to the tomb of
> Meseti at Asyut (Cairo 4918). It’s one of the largest model boats in
> existence, measuring over 1.5 metres, and it dates to approximately 2000BC,
> so over it’s 4000 years old. Very sad.

She also adds:

> There are worrying reports of archaeological sites and museums around the
> country being targeted but no concrete information as of yet. Nevertheless,
> I am still inspired and awed by the valiant efforts of ordinary Egyptian
> citizens taking a stand to protect the heritage of which they are so proud.
> For whatever damage has been done, it’s possible that it could have been
> much worse without their help. My focus on this site is on the artefacts
> because that is what I’m best able to comment on, but my thoughts are with
> the Egyptian people.

linking to Maitland's blog as well as several mainstream media reports.

As a reaction to the looting,
