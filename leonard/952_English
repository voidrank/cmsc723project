A vibrant movement of Latin American film producers is flourishing and
creating a 21st Century “Golden Age” of Latin American cinema. A group of film
artists from across the region recently filmed the movie “Puro Mula” (see
trailer [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnjVs7cS6j4)) in a suburb of
Guatemala City. However,[ it is not yet finished due to their reduced budget

writes Julio Flores.

[_Hacer Cine en Guatemala
[es]_](http://hacercineenguatemala.ning.com/profiles/blogs/puro-mula-es-una-
comedia) summarizes the plot, which occurs during the course of the same day.
Joel Fonseca, a lazy 28-year-old, who still lives with his parents, is the
star of the film. He was given the responsibility to watch over his nephew,
but the child leaves the house without notice, so Joel has to go out and try
to find him.

The film is directed by Enrique Pérez from the collective Best Picture System,
who describe themselves as much more than just a group of young people filming
a movie, as they say on [their MySpace page

The Best Picture System is a collective of artistic film producing and
training. It was founded in March 2006 by a group of students from the
Intenational School of Film and TV, EICTV in San Antonio de los Baños, Cuba.
The collective group is formed by young people from different Latin American
cultures, promoting the integration of our Latin American nations and the
development of an indigenous, innovative, and fresh cinematography.

In early December, “Puro Mula” was awarded with the “[Latin American Post-
Production Award](http://enelshow.com/news/2009/12/12/14443)” at the Havana
Film Festival, as announced by blogger [El
Lugareño](http://www.ellugareno.com/2009/12/premios-del-31-festival-de-cine-
de-la.html). Blogger Pro+ [congratulates them
](http://propositivo.blogspot.com/2009/09/puro-mula.html)for the film they
just produced.

[Puro Mula](http://puromula.blogspot.com/) has its own blog, so stay tuned for
the premiere in March 2010.
