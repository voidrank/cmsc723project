As the world's nations gather today in Copenhagen for the United Nations
Convention on Climate Change, Madagascar, [having already lost 90% of its
original
forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_by_region#Madagascar),
faces continued threats from black market logging. An illegal traffic of
rosewood, a topic of conversation in the Malagasy mediasphere for a few
months, has now been thoroughly exposed by an undercover team of
investigators. The details of this very profitable traffic have been made
public and shared by many citizen bloggers and scientific publications. The
latest report produced by Global Witness and Environmental Investigation
Agency (EIA) states that about [$460,000 USD worth of trade is cut down each
day](http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/890/en/illegal_malagasy_timber_trade_worth_up_to_460000_a_day),
with enforcement efforts hampered by the continued absence of a government of
national unity. The full report is available
[here](http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/1184/1260110056/mada_report_revised_finalen.pdf)
(and in French

The report contains <a href=](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

volume of the illegal traffic.

Malagasy blogger _Achille_ [quotes from the
report](http://reflexiums.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/madagascar-pillage-de-bois-
de-rose-et-ca-continue) (fr):

> En 2009, huit navires porte-containers ont quitté Vohémar avec à leur bord
> un total de 19 730 rondins et 50 584 planches dans 324 containers autorisés
> par le MEF (voir Annexe 9). Cela revient à environ 9 700 tonnes de bois de
> rose.

In 2009, eight containers left the port of Vohemar with 19,730 round logs and
50,584 flat logs in 324 containers authorised by the MEF (see annex 9). This
is the equivalent of 9700 tons of rosewood.

Video showing [the life of the villagers living in the area
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1hPviSbRcU) demonstrates that they clearly
did not benefit from the rosewood traffic:

When one compares the $460,000 a day from the trade with the fact that [89% of
the Malagasy population live with less than $2 a
day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty),
it is easy to understand why corruption and inequality are commonly regarded
as the main obstacles to human development in Madagascar.

Another independent report supported by the Jane Goodall Institute Schweiz was
published this week confirming the extent of what the authors, Schuurman and
Lowry, call the “[Madagascar Rosewood Massacre](http://www.mwc-
info.net/en/services/Journal_PDF%27s/Issue4-2/MCD_2009_vol4_iss2_rosewood_massacre.pdf)”
(pdf).

The authors also contributed to this video to raise awareness of the extent of
the loss in biodiversity due to the traffic:  

The US Senate legislated on this issue and Congressman Blumenauer (D-Oregon)
[wrote in a
statement](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2009/11/us-
house-condemns-madagascar-logging.html):

> After a coup in March, the new and weakened government of Andry Rajoelina
> issued sweeping decrees allowing the harvest and export of wood from
> protected forests and World Heritage Sites. The Obama administration has
> condemned the de facto government, and the Wildlife Conservation Society,
> the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and Conservation International have denounced
> the wholesale exploitation of some of the world's most diverse forests and
> decimation of the local population's resources and livelihoods

The rosewood scandal have now had a serious impact in the political process of
Madagascar. Former president Albert Zafy threatened to [disclose names in the
current Rajoelina government if a solution to unblock the deadlock over the
government of national union
](http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200912011133.html)is not found soon. The
necessity to reach a government of national union is also pressed on by the
conditionality of foreign investments by the United States ( [AGOA
](http://aidwatchers.com/2009/11/hopeless-cause-of-the-week-save-
madagascar/)and MCC) and the [European Union](http://www.madagascar-
tribune.com/Pression-diplomatique-sur-Andry,13158.html) (fr) (NB: 70% of the
Malagasy government budget come from foreign aid).

Interestingly, this decree allowed for the legal investigation of Gibson
guitars. Their [headquarters were raided by the US Fish and Wildlife
Service](http://www.prefixmag.com/news/gibson-guitars-under-investigation-for-
using-illeg/35088/) because the guitars were made from rosewood from the
illegal traffic in Madagascar. Judging from reactions of Twitter users around
the world, the fact that [Gibson guitars were implicated provoked more
reactions](http://twitter.com/#search?q=gibson%20madagascar) that the
potential [loss of the ring-tail lemur

The issue of deforestation in Madagascar is unfortunately not limited to
rosewood trafficking. Slash and burn agriculture has caused much of the
anthropogenic deforestation of the region. The NGO Vakanala has produced a
remarkable [3D real time visualization of the numbers of bush
fires](http://fire.vakanala.org) affecting Madagascar:
