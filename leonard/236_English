Civilization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-qhj3sJ5qs&feature=player_embedded)
and is a message of hope for the victims of the earthquake and tsunami.  
“The unprecedented disasters unfolding in Japan; earthquakes, tsunami, and
nuclear explosions, will somehow change things to come […] The world is not
going to change. Each one of us will change. And if we do, then yes, the world
will be changed. It is darkest right before the dawn. Let's all rise up to
welcome the morning that will be so very bright for mankind.”
