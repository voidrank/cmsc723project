On July 25, A French-Mauritanian [raid on Al Qaeda Islamic
Maghreb](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/07/25/mali-mauritania-hostage-
michel-germaneau-killed-in-failed-raid-as-tension-rises/) (AQIM) inside Malian
territory failed to free French aid worker Michel Germaneau who was killed by
his detainers. The raid has raised diplomatic tensions as France reaffirmed
their [plan to reinforce their fight against terrorism and
AQIM](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703578104575396912437173940.html)
in particular. Bloggers from the Sahel region are weary of the trends that the
latest events have highlighted: the rise of radicalization amongst the youth
of the region and the complex diplomatic dynamics between the nations
involved.

The radicalization of youth is symbolized by the path of Abdelkader Ould
Ahmednah, Mauritanian AQIM fighter who was killed during the raid. Mauritanian
activist and blogger _Nasser Weddady_ explains why one should play close
attention as to how [Abdelkader Ould Ahmednah came about getting involved with
AQIM](http://dekhnstan.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/a-dead-posh-mauritanian-
jihadi/):

> Ould Ahmednah had a guarenteed path to become, like many of his young
> tribesmen, a wealthy prosperous businessman. He chose otherwise. Ould
> Ahmednah and his siblings, are part of the country’s privileged elite. They
> were not driven into violent Jihadism by poverty. If anything, they were
> seduced by this ideology because Mauritania’s crumbling educational system
> fed them a belief that Islam is the core of their societies and that they
> are citizens of the _Islamic Republic of Mauritania_. Yet, they cannot
> reconcile that ideal with the realities of a society crumbling before their
> eyes. The next simplistic leap of faith for them is that if society is
> straying, then it must be that it needs to return to its core values

_Weddady_ adds:

> I feel that as long as Mauritania’s national narrative emphasizes Islam-a
> vague Islam at that- as the center of our national identity, we will be
> creating more Ould Ahmednahs. All it would take for someone (as the Muslim
> Brotherhood is doing right now) is to claim the mantle of Islam to disguise
> any ideological message to recruit a generation adrift and in search for
> bearings.

Blogger _Kal at The Moor Next Door_ emphasizes the point that AQIM ideology
resonates with affluent young Mauritanians and
[adds](http://themoornextdoor.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/re-franco-mauritanian-
aqim-raid/):

> This is important in the context of de-tribalization (as the urban
> population expands, international Arabic newspapers and satellite media and
> internet access grows people replace more limited tribal or family loyalties
> with more abstract internationalized ones be they nationalist, Arabist,
> Islamist or whatever) which has been proceeding rapidly in Mauritania since
> the late 1970s. This does not mean that young, “modern” men disconnect from
> tribalism, it simply means that they enter a new level of political
> consciousness that connects them to broader grievances (i.e., AQIM is able
> to use family/tribal linkages in recruiting, as in this case, but only by
> penetrating the parochial boundaries that otherwise insulate tribal people
> from internationalism).

_Kal_ also makes the point in the post that Algerian authorities felt that
they could have been consulted for more information before undertaking the
raid:

> The raid went on without Algerian support, foreknowledge and went outside of
> the Tamanrasset command set up after the regional anti-terrorism conference
> earlier this year. As they see it, the raid ignored the regional security
> structures set up expressly to deal with AQIM. The French reportedly
> provided logistical and technical support while the Mauritanians did the
> heavy-lifting. An Algerian source told this blogger that France’s
> association with the raid will only create the perception that “France
> attacked an African camp and killed Muslims. They will make more enemies for
> themselves this way. They put African efforts in danger if they associate
> themselves too publicly with these kinds of things because it can make [us]
> look like stooges, like the French are really the ones fighting these
> terrorists when it is us.”[..] Other Algerian sources say Algerian
> involvement might discredit anti-AQIM activity as much as France’s (for
> reasons of doctrine/mentality and Malian attitudes towards the Algerians).
> Others believe that Algerian involvement may initiate needless blood feuds
> with the local population. Malian and Mauritanian sources report that in the
> last six months Malian Arab smugglers have taken fire from Algerian
> helicopters near the Algerian border.

On twitter, _Kal_ posts that a second Algerian raid took place the same week
as the Franco-Mauritanian one and
[that](http://twitter.com/themoornextdoor/statuses/20227994286): ” Algerians
denied participation bc they wanted to use the French raid as cover”.

_Jeune Afrique_ reports that contrary to AQIM's allegations, French
authorities deny having negotiated with AQIM before the raid [fr]:

> L’Élysée le martèle depuis le début : les ravisseurs de Michel Germaneau,
> l’otage français dont l’exécution a été annoncée le 25 juillet dernier, ont
> toujours refusé de négocier. Lundi 2 août encore, Paris n’a pas dévié de
> cette version.

The Élysée (French President office) stated from the start: the people who
took Michel Germaneau hostage, whose announced his execution on July 25th,
always refused to negotiate. On Monday August 2nd, Paris still has not
deviated from this version.

_Jeune Afrique_ also indicates that [Algerian authorities might have been
informed of the
raid](http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAJA2586p006-007.xml6/france-
mauritanie-terrorisme-aqmile-raid-contre-aqmi-vu-d-alger.html) to liberate
Germeneau after all [fr]:

> D’habitude prompt à dénoncer « ce type d’ingérence », Alger s’est cette fois
> abstenu. Il faut dire que le Quai d’Orsay lui a coupé l’herbe sous le pied
> en annonçant que les autorités algériennes avaient été informées au
> préalable.

Usually Algiers is quite quick to denounce this “type of interference” but
this time, they decided to keep mum. The fact is, the Quai d'Orsay ( French
Foreign Affairs Office ) preempted any statement by the Algerian authorities
by announcing that they did inform them before taking action.
