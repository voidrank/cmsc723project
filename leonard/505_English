A year and a half after having been authorized to resume flights to Portugal,
the Angolan airline
[TAAG](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linhas_A%C3%A9reas_de_Angola), is again
involved in serious problems related to the safety of its planes.

Yesterday, December 6, a little after having taken off from Lisbon's Portela
Airport, passengers and crew that were aboard the Boeing 777 to Luanda heard a
noise and intense vibration caused by a number of parts that came loose from
the engine of the airplane. The parts fell on the streets of the town of
Almada, causing some physical damage and injuring two but not seriously.

There was no need to wait for the reaction of bloggers, faced with the
seriousness of the situation. The

According to news agencies and TV channels, the city of Almada was scene of a
scattering of parts that were projected from the TAAG plane that had taken off
from Portela Airport in Lisbon. Given that the TAAG planes that “circulate” in
European skies are, in principle, new, it is likely that Boeing, the company
that supplied them, is not being well regarded. Or have we returned to the
time of “friendship/fokker” and “dakotas” of the old DTA [earlier name for
TAAG] that were “screwed together” with wire? I really hope that it was a
small maintanence mishap and without big consequence, except [as SIC (private
Portuguese TV station)
reported](http://sic.sapo.pt/online/video/informacao/noticias-
pais/2010/12/duas-pessoas-sofreram-ferimentos-ligeiros-com-queda-de-pecas-de-
aviao06-12-2010-135510.htm), 10 buses and 2 light injuries.

Faced with this complex situtation, the pilots were forced to alter the flight
and emergency land at the airport in Lisbon. The more than 120 passengers were
taken to a hotel and it is said that TAAG does not intend to reimburse
customers for their return to Angola.

In parallel, the company already made it known, through its representative in
Portugal, that it will take responsibility for the results of the incident, by
way of an investigation already underway, to determine cause of the fault.

In 2007, the European Union put [TAAG on its black lits of
airlines](http://desabafosangolanos.blogspot.com/2007/06/taag-na-lista-negra-
da-europa.html) [pt] prohibited from flying in European airspace after France
had detected serious deficiencies in the safety of its airplanes. .

On the blog
_[Contraditório](http://www.contraditorio.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=390)
_[pt] reference is made to this hardly acceptable episode for the airline with
the Angolan flag

> Desde 2006 que estava em curso uma investigação por parte da União Europeia

Since 2006 there was an investigation underway by the European Union of the
Angolan airline TAAG. What is known is that France first detected serious
anolamies to the level of safety of this company's planes. Now that the
investigation is finished, the EU decided to prevent the entry of these planes
into European airspace. I think quite right, the rules are the same for all.
The reaction from Angola was singular: careful, be very careful, if you
prohibit our flights there, we will prohibit your flights here (Angola). In
other words: do not even talk about trying to follow the minimum saftey
directives. Blackmail, spend less and it tends to have results.

At the time, and to minimize the loss, TAAG opted to rent planes from South
African Airlines, including crews from that country.

In 2009 the restriction was partially lifted and the EU recommended that the
Angolan airline resume flights between Luanda and Lisbon, with the Instituto
Nacional de Aviação Civil (National Civil Aviation Institute) commiting to do
inspections on the aircraft that operated this route. Apparently, the
collaboration was not adequate.

According to the author of the blog _[Linha de Rumo](http:
linhaderumo.blogspot.com) _[pt]:

> Parece que nem com a ajuda da TAP (Transportadora Aérea de Portugal) na
> manutenção a coisa vai… ou então já são problemas antigos, afinal o mesmo me
> aconteceu em 1 de Abril de 2007 e aconteceu novamente em 2 de Abril de 2009

It seems like even with the help of TAP [Portuguese national airline] in
maintenance the thing works… or maybe then the problems go way back, after all
the same thing happened to me on April 1, 2007 and happened again on April 2,
2009 in Luanda on TAP…

What remains to be seen is how this sad episode will influence the
relationship between TAAG and the European Union and with its customers who
have for a long time complained about the national carrier for a number of
different reasons, delays being the most common one. New developments are
expected soon.
