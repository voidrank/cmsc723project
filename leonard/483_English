Severe cutbacks on subsidies that have kept prices on many goods artificially
low are feared to cause problems for many middle class and poor citizens in
Iran.

According to [MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40783778/ns/world_news-
mideastn_africa/), “Fuel prices have at least quadrupled and bread prices have
more than doubled in the past week since the government started dramatically
reducing subsidies”.

Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi said Wednesday that
a “dark future” awaits the economy because the government doesn't listen to
economists ([one economist was
arrested](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/12/23/dabashi.iran.subsidies/index.html?section=cnn_latest)
after speaking with foreign media).

Iranian bloggers have also reacted to what President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has
called “the biggest surgery” in Iran's economy in 50 years.

Several bloggers including one pro-Ahmadinejad blogger expressed their deep
concern for the outcome of these cutbacks.

the greatest burden is on the middle class and the poor and that the best way
to resist would be a general strike.

_Masaeb Ahmadinejad_ , is a pro-Ahmadinejad blogger but[ also criticized

believes the subsidy cuts will stir trouble, and writes that during previous
presidencies inflation provoked riots. The blogger says that most of
Ahmadinejad's supporters come from the middle class, and that the economic
situation will damage the image of the president.

what they will earn from clients.
