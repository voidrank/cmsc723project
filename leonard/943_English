Blogging from and about space gains popularity and recognition among
professional space travelers and regular bloggers. Russia is no exception.
While the latest fashion for NASA astronauts _[is space
twittering](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/31/usa-mexico-astronaut-
jose-hernandez-twittering-from-space/)_ [ENG], more and more space explorers
are going full-text. And the fact that one wouldn't necessarily call those
blogs _par excellence_ doesn't make them less interesting.

Maxim Suraev is the first Russian astronaut to start a blog. His first post
appeared on October 14 at [the Web site of the Russian Space Agency
(Roscosmos)](http://www.roscosmos.ru/DocDoSele.asp?DocGroupID=7&DocID=528)
[RUS]. The English translation of Maxim's online diary “[The Orbital
Log](http://rt.com/About_Us/Blogs/orbital-log.html)” [ENG] later appeared on
the Web site of _[Russia Today](http://rt.com/)_ and quickly gained popularity
among international audience. _The Wired_ magazine called Suraev's blog the
“[Best Cosmonaut Blog Ever](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/best-
cosmonaut-blog-ever/)” [ENG] and noticed that it covered a much different
array of topics than one could usually see in NASA press releases or Twitter
feeds.

_The Wired_ correspondent Alexis Madrigal
[wrote](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/best-cosmonaut-blog-ever/):

> We tend to receive our vision of space exploration through the American
> lens, so it’s great to get some outside perspective on what’s going on up
> there. And Suraev’s site really feels like someone’s blog.

According to the Russian Space Agency, Suraev regularly sends his blog posts
via e-mail to the Web site administrators and they publish it for general
audience. Then the blog is translated in English. Although Suraev's posts are
not very elaborate and technically perfect but they are full of pictures and
interesting observations.

The posts mostly describe space routine: how people live at ISS, dress, cook,
play sports, deal with trash, meet new astronauts arriving to the station,
etc. In fact, there are probably more pictures than words. The blog is full of
humor and sometimes rebellious actions. Suraev recollects in one of his blog
posts how he “smuggled” seeds of wheat to the ISS and planted then as an
experiment. When Earth-based scientists ordered to eliminate the grass, [he
refused](http://rt.com/About_Us/Blogs/orbital-log/green-green-
grass....html?fullstory) [ENG].

[Some of the pics](http://www.roscosmos.ru/PictFiles/8/max_cable_mrm1.JPG) by
Suraev are extremely funny, [some are
interesting](http://www.roscosmos.ru/DocDoSele.asp?DocID=583&ShowAdm=), others
are [simply impossible to take anywhere
else](http://www.roscosmos.ru/PictFiles/8/apelsin_zhong.jpg). Did you see the
Moon like

Interestingly enough, Maxim's first space flight was with Guy Laliberte – a
space tourist, blogger and founder of _Cirque Du Soleil_. Who knows, maybe
it's Guy who suggested Maxim to start a blog.

Guy's blog has 201 entries covering each day of training and flight and is
available in Russian, English and French (see GVO coverage of _[his space
trip](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/11/russia-cirque-du-soleil-
founder-a-space-tourist/)_ [ENG]). Since most of the entries on the blog are
original observations written by Guy, they lack a little imperfection we all
like about blogs. Nevertheless, some of the [Guy's
confessions](http://www.onedrop.org/en/mission_space/guy_laliberte_space/Back_on_Earth.aspx)
[ENG] are breathtaking:

> If I had to describe to you how I felt as the spacecraft went upward, I
> would have to say that the feelings were more emotional and spiritual than
> physical.
>
> During the last separation stage, we distinctly heard the disconnection and,
> quite unexpectedly, our little stuffed animal began to fly! Our limbs felt
> light all of a sudden—we were weightless! We looked at each other and did a
> high-five! :) I quickly looked out the window and saw a marvellous and very
> round ball: WOW, what a magnificent site! The sky is not the limit.
>
> After a few minutes, I saw the Earth and an almost full Moon, and we began
> our orbit. We stayed in our seats for a few more hours then moved over to
> our cabin on the other side. We removed our flight suits and, at that
> moment, I lived my first period of adaptation—the hardest one for me up
> until then—and threw up what I had eaten and drank. This lasted a few
> seconds then I felt different, and everything went well after that.

Guy's trip to the outer limits became a significant event in the Russian
online community mainly because the space trip was organized by the Russian
Space Agency. Guy has become the 7th space tourist in the world's history. The
previous departure (on March 26, 2009) of 6th space tourist _[Charles
Simonyi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi)_ [ENG], head of
Microsoft software group, was [photo-
documented](http://community.livejournal.com/live_report/204002.html) [RUS] by
an LJ-user _[chat-de-mer](http://chat-de-mer.livejournal.com/)_.
