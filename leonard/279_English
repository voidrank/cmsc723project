The crackdown on protesters in [Daraa,
Syria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa) continues. At dawn a special army
unit reportedly [killed at least six
people](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113231127592364.html)
during an attack on Al Omari Mosque to disperse the protesters who have been
using it as a gathering place and makeshift hospital.

Syrian national television reported that it was an armed gang that attacked
ambulances and security forces and that they had guns, ammunition, grenades,
and stacks of money hidden inside the mosque:

Syrians were quick to point out that the video is a bad fabrication at best.
Al Omari Mosque was full of blankets and medical supplies and was dirty after
the protests, as opposed to what was shown on Syrian television. Facebook
users joked that the Syrian national TV segment was like a badly directed
Syrian drama and that governmental claims hold no water.

Twitter users are also reporting that [Khaled
Elekhetyar](http://freelancitizen.blogspot.com), a Syrian journalist and
blogger is unreachable, and his Facebook account has been hacked and used to
post pro-Assad propaganda.

following:

Journalist Khaled Elekhetyar missing from the internet and has been
unreachable for over 24 hours.

A friend of Khaled who wishes to remain anonymous said:

And the harrowing reports from the events in Syria keep trickling through the
enforced media and communication blackout. _@1SecularSyrian_

What's happening in Daraa can't be described as madness; Madness is
creativity, and there's no creativity in killing people but only sadism.

Reports of a brutal crackdown are non-stop. The next video was recorded
yesterday and it shows plainclothes security agents arresting people randomly
from the streets:  

This story is ongoing and will be updated as details become available.
