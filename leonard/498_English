The Malaysian government has imposed a five-year moratorium on medical
programs across the country, with the aim of shifting the focus from quantity
to quality as the number of medical graduates increase every year.

Pagalavan Letchumanan[ believes](http://pagalavan.com/2010/12/12/for-future-
doctors-housemanship-glut/) that imposing a moratorium alone will not be
enough.

_Medicine Malaysia_ [also
believes](http://medicinemalaysia.com/wp2/2010/12/12/5-year-moratorium-a-
stopgap-measure/) that the moratorium is inadequate, and there needs to be a
reform in the medical schools to increase the quality of graduates.

Alex Tang however, is
[relieved](http://draltang01.blogspot.com/2010/06/coming-oversupply-of-
doctors-in.html) that the problem of an oversupply of medical students has
been acknowledged, although he feels that it is too late.

It is clear that this issue is not being met with support by most Malaysians,
and many had even blamed the government for creating the problem in the first
place. Blogger Dr Hsu
[expressed](http://hsudarren.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/a-doctor-too-many-ii/)
one such opinion.

> The sudden mushrooming of medical schools are apparently due to shortages of
> doctors in the public sectors. This is because most doctors in government
> service resign after their compulsory services and opt for the supposedly
> greener pasture in the private sector.
>
> In most other countries, the logical thing to do to counter this brain drain
> of doctors to private sector is to find out why doctors are resigning from
> government service and then try to address the woes of the doctors , and
> hopefully keep them in service. I call this common logic.
>
> The Malaysian solution , like in many other instances, does not take common
> logic into account but rather uses the sledgehammer approach.
>
> If the doctors do not want to stay in government service, then Malaysia
> shall flood the market with doctors, so goes the Malaysian logic. Never mind
> that setting up of medical schools and training doctors are expensive
> businesses.
>
> If enough doctors are produced, the market will be saturated with doctors
> and thus doctors will have no where to go but to stay put in government
> service.

These come in light of the [report

Malaysia's leading English newspaper The Star of the Government's decision to
