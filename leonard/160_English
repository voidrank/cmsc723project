**UPDATE: Wednesday, May 11, 2011 – 9:15 a.m.:**
_[Babalu](http://babalublog.com/2011/05/murdered-cuban-activist-medical-
records-refute-castro-regimes-claim-of-death-by-natural-causes/)_ links to [a
medical report](http://www.penultimosdias.com/2011/05/10/extracto-de-historia-
clinica-de-juan-wilfredo-soto-no-menciona-pancreatitis/) [ES] which leads him
to surmise that:

> Several months ago, Soto Garcia was examined by doctors and of the many
> ailments suffered by the activist and documented in their report,
> pancreatitis was not one of them. The pancreatitis that afflicted and
> ultimately killed Soto Garcia came suddenly, and most likely from the brutal
> and violent blows he was subjected to by Castro State Security agents.

The blogger also [notes that](http://babalublog.com/2011/05/opposition-in-
cuba-calls-for-investigation-into-dissidents-murder/) “members of the
opposition and dissidence in Cuba are calling for an international
investigation into the murder of opposition member Juan Wilfredo Soto”, while

are-letting-them-know-that-we-are-not-afraid-marta-diaz-rondon-and-caridad-
caballero-batista-narrate-the-repression-against-them/)_ observes:

**END UPDATE**

Cuban bloggers [continue their
outcry](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/09/cuba-role-of-police-in-
dissidents-death/) over [the death of dissident Juan Wilfredo
Soto](http://www.desdecuba.com/generationy/?p=2478), especially in light of an
official statement [which
suggests](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/10/us-cuba-dissident-death-
idUSTRE74909820110510) that Soto, popularly known by his nickname “The
Student”, died “of natural causes”.

On hearing the position of the Cuban government, _[Uncommon
Sense](http://marcmasferrer.typepad.com/uncommon_sense/2011/05/the-death-of-
juan-wilfredo-soto-garc%C3%ADa-requires-cubans-everywhere-to-bear-
witness.html)_ quips:

> That could be true, of course, because in Cuba under Castro, the police
> beating a dissident is as natural as it comes.

Then his tone becomes serious, saying:

> But the party line has been undermined by witnesses who have stepped forward
> to tell what they know about Soto's death. The party line is being
> undermined by the truth.
>
> For instance, there is Mario Lleonart Barroso who says he spoke to Soto
> after he was beaten and before he was readmitted to a hospital in severe
> pain.

The blogger also speaks of “other witnesses ready to testify not to what they
saw but ready to risk their own lives to ensure that justice prevails in
Soto's death” as well as “numerous dissidents ready to go on hunger strike if
by July 26, 2011, the dictatorship does not properly investigate what happened
to Soto.” One dissident has [reportedly already
begun](http://www.diariodecuba.com/derechos-humanos/4554-el-opositor-jorge-
luis-artiles-montiel-en-huelga-de-hambre-por-el-asesinato-de) [es] his hunger
strike.

The two accounts of Soto's death could not be more contradictory, with [local
dissidents insisting](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-on-
soto.html) that he had been beaten by police and officials maintaining that
his “acute pancreatitis…led to multiple organ failure” and [calling the
allegations of police
brutality](http://alongthemalecon.blogspot.com/2011/05/cuban-government-
police-brutality-
claim.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AlongTheMalecn+%28Along+the+Malec%C3%B3n%29)
a “‘smear campaign’ aimed at weakening the Cuban revolution.”

_[Babalu](http://babalublog.com/2011/05/natural-causes-of-death-in-cuba/)_
does not accept the official line, saying:

> Apparently, a vicious and brutal beating by State Security is considered a
> natural cause of death in Cuba.

The blog also [takes issue](http://babalublog.com/2011/05/it-is-all-the-
victims-fault/) with [this
post](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2011/05/death-in-santa-clara.html),
saying:

> Once again we have a ‘Cuba Expert’ blaming the victim instead of the
> assailant. Juan Wilfredo Soto Garcia is dead not because Cuban security
> agents beat him to death, but because Soto Garcia ‘resisted their entreaties
> to leave the area.’

Meanwhile, _[Pedazos de la
Isla](http://pedazosdelaislaen.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/cuban-regime-murders-
another-dissident-juan-wilfredo-soto-garcia/)_ spares a thought for Soto's
mother, who “must accept the harsh reality of no longer being able to see her
son just because chose to defend human rights in a country where all that is
just is considered illegal.” The blogger goes on to question the position of
the Cuban government:

> The only thing that is clear is that they have responded with fear, quickly
> asserting that it was all a lie. Now we must wait and see if the
> international media will repeat the absurd fallacies created by the Castro
> government, as many did with Orlando Zapata.

_[Octavo Cerco](http://octavocercoen.blogspot.com/2011/05/photo-claudio-
fuentes-madan-how-do-i.html)_ offers a more personal perspective on the
situation:

> The last image I have of Juan Wilfredo Soto Garcia is at my side running
> around under the Santa Clara’s relentless sun. We tried to get permission
> from the Bishop so that Padre Dominico–who had come halfway around the world
> to get to Cuba–could go see Guillermo Fariñas in Intensive Care at the
> scheduled visiting hours.
>
> Now I look at the photo in [Penultimos
> Dias](http://www.penultimosdias.com/2011/05/09/urgente-fallece-disidente-
> tras-golpiza-policial-urgente-fallece-disidente-tras-golpiza-policial/) of
> the Student and I don’t recognize him. It must be that I refuse to accept
> that they beat him to death. It must be that I can’t admit that this time of
> horror has come to this Island. And I ask myself–is it the obvious
> uncertainty of rationalism–how many Wilfredos have there already been and
> how many are still to come? While sitting in a park, an incomprehensible
> crime, the massive weight of half a century of police impunity falling on
> his body.

Finally, the blogger goes on to say of the Cuban police, whom she calls
“anonymous faces in blue”:

> For a long time people have feared them more than the thieves, scammers and
> criminals. “Call the police” has become the last card in the deck. Because
> justice does not come with them. Because they are not here to protect us,
> but to control us at any price.
