As Singapore prepares for the General Elections 2011, netizens are actively
commenting on various election issues.

_kelvintan73_ thinks that voters “will remain contented in the [Singapore
Matrix](http://kelvintan73.livejournal.com/135158.html)”

An anonymous writer lists his [election
agenda](http://www.transitioning.org/2011/03/03/hot-election-issues-for-a-
concerned-singapore/)

> We should look at ways to sustain economic growth without letting in too
> many foreign workers
>
> Taxpayers’ monies are used to fund foreigners’ university education while
> our young people can’t get in and their parents have to spend more to send
> them overseas for their first degree.

> Talking about public transport, the PAP government should not have

PAP refers to the ruling People’s Action Party which has been in power for
more than four decades.

Catherine Lim reminds PAP that it should tolerate
[“disruption”](http://catherinelim.sg/2010/02/23/the-dirtiest-words-in-the-
pap-vocabulary/) in politics

> Disruption is necessary for the political education of the people. Indeed,

> sophisticated and articulate through wide media exposure, the noise and
> brouhaha of public debate would be far more instructive than a centrally
> planned, government-approved programme in political education for the
> schools.

_The Itch To Write_ , an election volunteer,
[observes](http://leelilian.blogspot.com/2011/02/i-have-not-voted-before.html)
that some residents are not aware of the coming elections

> My heart sank, I was right. She doesn't even know what voting is let alone
> know the other political parties. Or she probably did but it was so long ago
> that she had forgotten.

_The Art of Dumbspeak_ explains why [he is not inclined to
vote](http://thotspeak.blogspot.com/2011/02/to-vote-or-not-to-vote.html) this
year

> This year I will be 32 and unlike the last two elections, I will be a very
> different voter. I belong to Generation X, I have responsibilities to my
> family (read: debt) and I have spent some years in the workforce.
>
> You can say my political vision isn't 20/20, but it's a lot clearer than 5
> or 10 years ago.
>
> So it's a pity that I won't likely be voting this time, I would have liked
> the chance to make a choice based on what I believe in for a change, rather
> than what I fear, or simply voting opposition for the sake of opposing the
> PAP.

_Onesingaporean_ identifies the
[strategy](http://onesingaporean.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/how-the-game-is-
played-in-singapore/) of the ruling party to garner more votes

> As the General Elections approaches, the ruling party will put the brakes on
> price rises which affect ordinary Singaporeans. Not good to go to the polls
> with an electorate all pent up with anger. Once the brakes are on, the
> goodies are dished out – as in the recently-announced Budget. All adult
> Singaporeans will get between S$600 and S$800 – in cash. As in the General
> Elections of 2006, this will undoubtedly be credited into citizens’ bank
> accounts. Citizens need not do anything – except to trudge to their nearest
> ATM to withdraw the cash.
>
> And again, as in 2006, the cash dished out will be close to Polling Day.
> That year, it was one week before citizens went to the polls. This year –
> 2011 – the cash is set to be given out from 1 May.
>
> That’s the strategy of the PAP, a party which is gradually losing its
> appeal. No wonder that it resorts to handing out cold hard cash.

_Singapore Lighthouse_ [will not vote for PAP](http://singapore-
lighthouse.blogspot.com/2011/02/singapore-election-department-drawn.html)
candidates. Here are some of his reasons:

> \- Opening of the flood gates of foreigners into Singapore to compete for
> jobs with Singaporeans.
>
> \- No independent Election Department (Its under the Prime Minister's
> Office, WTF???)
>
> \- Having a World Best Salary while keep telling the people to increase
> productivity and settle with low wages for low income earners. Anyway we no
> need a minimum wages policy although China and Hong Kong had already
> implemented one.
