As the dust settles following the Israeli Defense Forces’ brutal attack on the
Gaza Freedom Flotilla, news has emerged of the deaths of nine activists who
were aboard the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara. Eight of the people killed were
Turkish nationals, the other a nineteen-year-old Turkish-American dual citizen
named [Furkan Dogan](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-
East/2010/0603/Israeli-raid-on-Gaza-Freedom-Flotilla-killed-US-citizen-Furkan-
Dogan). Dogan, who is stated to have resided mostly in Turkey, was shot a
total of five times, four [in the head at close
range](http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Media/american-killed-gaza-aid-
flotilla/story?id=10814848).

_Jim Buie_ , an American blogger who resides in Kayseri, Turkey, the same town
in which Dogan is from,
[writes](http://jimbuie.blogs.com/journal/2010/06/turkishamerican-killed-by-
israeli-soldiers-on-flotilla-was-from-kayseri.html) this of his background:

For many Americans, the subject of the day is the United States’ relationship
with Israel. On Twitter, @[hughsansom](http://twitter.com/hughsansom/) notes
the United States’ track record in responding to American deaths at the hands
of Israel:

Key to any discussion of U.S.-Israeli relations is the amount of money the
United States provides the Israeli military in aid, an [estimated 3 billion
USD](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/07/29/afx3963706.html) per year.

many-americans-will-be-murdered-by-israel-american-shot-5-times-on-flotilla/)
for the United States to end that relationship:

> Five bullets? Five bullets for an unarmed person? Were these bullets paid

> bullets have inscribed on them “to our special friends, love the USA”?
> Bullets used on American citizens.

Muslim-American blogger _Hijabmaster_ picks apart the media reports, which
have often referred to Dogan as a “Turkish citizen with an American passport.”
Of the distinction, she
[says](http://hijabmaster.blogspot.com/2010/06/4-shots-to-head-and-one-to-
chest-is.html):

> Now there are only two kinds of people that can have a US passport. A US
> national and a US citizen. ALL U.S. citizens are US nationals but all US
> nationals aren't US citizens. U.S. passports issued to non-citizen nationals
> contains the endorsement code 9 which states: “THE BEARER IS A UNITED STATES
> NATIONAL AND NOT A UNITED STATES CITIZEN.” on the annotations page.(read
> [Nationals who are not US
> citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Nationals_who_are_not_citizens)).
> Furkan Dogan's passport did not contain that annotation and therefore is an
> AMERICAN CITIZEN. Most likely a dual citizen and choosing to say a Turkish
> citizen was killed is better than saying AMERICAN CITIZEN.

Stephen Saperstein Frug, whose blog is called _Attempts_ , rejects the Israeli
version of events that claimed IDF gunfire was in self-defense. Referring to
Dogan's death, the blogger
[writes](http://stephenfrug.blogspot.com/2010/06/one-bullet-in-chest-and-four-
bullets.html):

> If confirmed, it will certainly put the lie to any claim of self defense by
> the shooter. A bullet in the chest might well be self-defense (by an
> aggressor, of course — the Israelis shouldn't have been on that ship in the
> first place, and they were the ones attacking — but nevertheless
> understandable). A bullet in the head at close range… possibly, probably not
> but possibly, that's self-defense too.
>
> Three more? That's murder. And calls into question the entire rest of the
> scenario.

Finally, Richard Silverstein, an American who writes the popular blog _Tikun
Olam_ (a Hebrew phrase that means “repairing the world”), [wonders
aloud](http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/2010/06/03/19-year-old-
turkish-american-killed-by-idf-in-gaza-flotilla-attack/comment-
page-1/#comment-129505) if President Obama will do the right thing in response
to Dogan's death:

> Barack Obama, do you let U.S. citizens be murdered in cold blood by the IDF?
> What will you do about this? If this were any other country I’d know what to
> expect: protest, redoubled efforts to end the Gaza siege, engagement with
> Israel, possibly withdrawing the U.S. ambassador. That’s what Britain would
> likely do, as it’s already had the moxie to demand an end to the siege,
> something our government hasn’t had the courage to do. This incident should
> bring our policy a lot closer to Turkey’s as we clearly now have shared
> interests. But will it?
>
> But given the timidity of this government, I don’t know what they’ll do
> aside from murmuring a bit about it. Face it, our policy is shameful.
> Dogan’s dead body serves as physical witness to this. Will it spur Obama on
> to do the right thing–or anything? Your guess is as good as mine.
