The fine left some Egyptian tweeps scratching their heads, making some reach
out to their calculators to see if the spoils will get filtered down to
subscribers.

ليا كام فى ال90 مليون دول يعنى كده الشركات المفروض تدينا تعويضات عن الضرر و
يخدو هما الفلوس

How much do we get from this $90m? This means that the companies should
compensate us for damages or do they just take the money?

Mohammed Yousif, who tweets @JawazSafar,
[adds](https://twitter.com/#!/JawazSafar/status/74439809065693184):

And Egyptian lawyer and the executive director of the Arabic Network for Human
Rights Information Gamal Eid
[adds](https://twitter.com/#!/gamaleid/status/74443822452572160):

قضيتنا ضد شركات الاتصالات نتهمهم بالمشاركة الجنائية في قتل الثوار المصريين
،لحين اثبات انهم أبرياء بالوثائق http://www.anhri.net/?p=31086

Our case is against the telecommunication companies. We are accusing them as
accomplices in the killing of Egyptian protesters until they prove their
innocence with documentation
