Cuban bloggers have done well to document the political, economic, and
technological obstacles that prevent most Cubans from using the Internet. But
few have written about the political gridlock that has contributed to the
island’s poor telecommunications infrastructure.

US-based and US-affiliated telecom companies, which is to say, nearly all
telecoms that offer service in the Caribbean, face severe restrictions in the
US- Cuba embargo legislation, and this has put Cuba in a fundamental
disadvantage for decades when it comes to telecommunications.

President Obama [pledged to eliminate these restrictions in
2009](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/04/13/AR2009041302965.html), but has made little
progress on his promise. In a [July/August 2010 editorial in _Foreign
Policy_](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/15/havana_calling?page=0,1),
Christopher Sabatini summarized the current legislation, which remains too
restrictive to allow US-affiliated telecommunications companies to conduct any
business on the island, whether it be selling hardware or software, or
building new infrastructure. He remarked that with the current policy:

> …there's little room for any real U.S. business activity that could link the
> island to the Internet and provide citizens with the tools of communication.
> Instead, the provisions only allow for the donation of these items,
> rendering a critical foreign-policy objective to philanthropy.

The only reforms that have actually been made allow for[ individuals living
outside of Cuba to pay for cell phone handsets and roaming
service](http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg273.htm) for Cuban family
members and friends on the island. While this has made a difference for
thousands of Cubans, the island could gain greater opportunities to access
digital communications technologies if President Obama were to further
liberalize or eliminate restrictions on telecom companies. He could do this by
executive order.

There is no guarantee that the Cuban government would allow US-based or US-
affiliated telecoms to conduct business on the island, even if they were free
to do so. But by lifting these restrictions, the Obama administration could
cease to stand in the way of increasing digital and telecommunications access
for Cubans, and put the political ball in Cuba’s court.

While the US continues to postpone reforms, [Telecomunicaciones Gran
Caribe](http://www.telecom.gob.ve/cable.php) of Venezuela has proceeded with
plans to build a submarine fiber optic cable linking Venezuela’s Caribbean
coast, Cuba, and Jamaica. How this will change Internet use in Cuba remains
unclear, but it is certain that it will help to further strengthen the
diplomatic and political bond between Cuba and Venezuela, an already very
sharp thorn in the side of the US government. This could incentivize the Obama
administration to pursue further liberalizations, but it hasn’t yet.

Many in the US-Cuba policy community believe that President Obama is running
out of the time and political capital necessary to make reforms to the
embargo. After Tuesday’s midterm elections in the US, the blogosphere was
alive with commentary on the election of soon-to-be [Florida Senator Marco
Rubio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio), a GOP and Tea Party magnate
and the son of pro-embargo Cuban émigrés. Rubio is adamant about “holding the
line” against Cuba.

Anya Landau-French, at [The Havana
Note](http://thehavananote.com/2010/11/what_do_mid_terms_election_results_mean_us_cuba_policy),
writes that with Rubio in office:

> The level of pro-embargo, anti-engagement speechifying, floor-side colleague
> arm-twisting and bipartisan sign-on letter-writing and hand-wringing will
> certainly amp up.

Given the changing tide of Cuban-American opinion on US-Cuba relations, will
this make a difference? _[El Yuma](http://elyuma.blogspot.com/2010/11/marco-
rubio-gops-great-right-hope.html)_ predicts that Rubio’s influence on US-Cuba
policy (and US politics on the whole) will be formidable, telling readers:

> Do not underestimate him or the potential of his wide appeal to American
> voters outside of the Cuban-American community and outside of the state of
> Florida…

Whether or not Rubio’s victory will impact President Obama’s decisions
regarding executive order-tied reforms, the political climate for change
towards Cuba may be growing cold. Phil Peters, of _[The Cuban
Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2010/11/after-wave.html)_ ,
remarked on the narrowing opportunities for Obama to create meaningful reforms
to the embargo. Referring to the [recent market-oriented economic reforms in
Cuba](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/14/cuba-cutting-jobs/), Peters
wrote:
