Cape Verdeans headed to the polls to vote for Members of Parliament on
February 6, and granted PAICV's (African Party for the Independence of Cape
Verde) leader [José Maria
Neves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Maria_Neves) his third 5-year
term as Prime Minister. Here is a recap on how bloggers perceived the events
and envision the development of the country.

Since 1991, when Cape Verde adopted the multi-party system, the
[PAICV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Party_for_the_Independence_of_Cape_Verde)
and the
[MpD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Democracy_%28Cape_Verde%29)
(Movement for Democracy) have been the two most influential political parties.
Each party ruled the country for 10 years. [Carlos
Veiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Veiga), member of MpD, was the main
candidate facing the Prime Minister in power, José Maria Neves.

Virgilio Brandão, on the blog _Terra-Longe_ , [shared an
analysis](http://terra-longe.blogspot.com/2011/02/maioria-absoluta-do-paicv-
os-resultados.html) [pt] of the results, which gave PAICV MPs an absolute
majority of National Assembly seats. He considered that the way candidates
dealt with the results reveals a country that, in spite of all its problems,
including those within the political process, made the elections a legitimate
feature:

> O discurso de José Maria Neves foi de quem soube ganhar, e o de Carlos Veiga
> de quem soube perder. Em contraponto da campanha eleitoral, as declarações
> destes dois líderes […], ao se conhecerem os resultados oficiosos,
> qualificaram o processo eleitoral.

José Maria Neves’ speech was that of someone who knew how to win, and Carlos
Veiga's of one who knew to how to lose. In contrast to what was seen during
the campaign, the statements by these two leaders […], when official results
were released, qualified the election process.

[For blogger Rony Moreira](http://geracao20j73.blogspot.com/2010/12/o-bagaco-
eleitoral-ii-o-equilibro-dos.html) [pt], from _Geração 20 J. 73_ , the
political polarization “over the decades of MpD [rule] and the other 10 years
of PAICV” was just a “languishing discussion”.

**Challenges for Growth and Development**

Rony Moreira looks at the country as a whole and
[argues](http://geracao20j73.blogspot.com/2010/12/o-bagaco-eleitoral-ii-o-
equilibro-dos.html) [pt] on the reasons why the political event was so
important:

> A tarefa de governar Cabo Verde é tão grata, que muitos ainda não perceberam
> que o mais essencial e complexo neste processo de governação passa pela
> implementação dum equilíbrio frágil: como deve um país pobre, redistribuir a
> riqueza (produzida e doada) de forma a equilibrar a coesão social e ao mesmo
> tempo criar mecanismos económicos (como a infra-estruturação) que o capacita
> para a competição e desenvolvimento futuro.

The task of governing Cape Verde is so gratifying that many haven't yet
realized that the most essential and complex aspect within this process of
governance is the implementation of a fragile balance: how should a poor
country redistribute wealth (produced and donated) in order to balance social
cohesion and, at the same time, create economic mechanisms (such as
infrastructure) to prepare it for competition and future development.

As a candidate, José Maria Neves promised to create a minimum wage and to
tackle unemployment ([different estimates range from 13,1% to
20,9%](http://www.expressodasilhas.sapo.cv/pt/noticias/detail/id/17095) [pt]),
but, once elected, he postponed these measures until 2012. Edy, blogger on
_Blogue di Nhu Naxu_ , [says it was
reasonable](http://alibemtempu.blogspot.com/2011/02/apertar-o-cinto.html)
[pt]:

> E já agora,este apertar de cinto não tem nada de surpreendente e nada de
> anormal: é que é mesmo necessário baixar o défice das finanças públicas.O
> país está a viver acima das suas possibilidades.

And now, this belt-tightening is not at all surprising and is not abnormal:
it's indeed necessary to lower the public finance deficit. The country is
living far beyond its means.

On another post, Rony Moreira isn't too concerned about the unemployment rate
either, [as he highlights](http://geracao20j73.blogspot.com/2010/12/o-bagaco-
eleitoral-i-ate-onde-podemos.html) [pt] that Cape Verde is making progress,
with both its positive and negative factors:

> […] a ausência de recursos matérias valiosos; estruturas de mercado
> deficitário [na dimensão, no tecido empresarial; alto grau de dependência de
> investimento e de factores externos]; taxa de crescimento de habitantes
> residentes [nativos e estrangeiros] e subsequente aumento da população
> activa; continuação de aposta na formação e qualificação dos quadros jovens
> […]

[…] the absence of valuable natural resources; market structures in deficit
[in general, among businesses; high level of dependency on external factors
and investment]; population growth rate [among natives and foreigners] and the
subsequent rise in active population; the ongoing investment in education and
qualification of young people […]

In another post, Edy
[believes](http://alibemtempu.blogspot.com/2011/02/aprender-com-
experiencia.html) [pt] that Cape Verde's economic situation is understandable
if we take into account global events:

> […] nem sempre é possível atingir o nível de crescimento económico desejável
> porque um governo não consegue controlar ou prever a evolução da economia
> internacional, do qual estamos dependentes, para o bem e para o mal […]

[…] it isn't always possible to reach our desired growth rate because a
government cannot control or predict the evolution of the international
economy, which we depend on, for better or for worse […]

João Branco, on the blog _Café Margoso_ , wrote a post with personal
considerations. [He pondered
that](http://cafemargoso.blogspot.com/2011/02/cronica-desaforada.html) [pt]
Cape Verde “is not walking towards the precipice, it isn't near total
breakdown” as the opposition claimed, and nor is it “the pink-colored country
the ruling party wanted to portray”.

Rony Moreira [foresees
challenges](http://geracao20j73.blogspot.com/2011/02/banho-lagrimas-alegria-e-
um-dia-depois.html) [pt] for the reelected Prime Minister, as solutions must
be found to high unemployment rates and other national issues:

> Ganha a eleição, há quem pense que esta será a mais fácil das legislaturas
> de Neves, e eu prevejo que seja a mais difícil e trabalhosa que o PAICV terá
> pela frente. Porque em 2016 alguns dos desafios terão de ser vencidos, caso
> da energia, educação, a redução para um dígito do desemprego e a habitação.

After his electoral victory, there are those who believe this will be the
easiest term for Neves, while I foresee this will be the toughest and most
difficult term the PAICV has to face. By 2016, some challenges must be solved,
such as energy, education, reduction of unemployment rates and housing.

**Democracy in Progress**

Despite political preferences, Cape Verdeans expressed in the blogosphere
their satisfaction with the election process. João Branco was one of those
bloggers, [saying he is
proud](http://cafemargoso.blogspot.com/2011/02/declaracao-cafeana_11.html)
[pt] of Cape Verde's 20 years of democracy:

> Vinte anos. Não é nada, numa perspectiva histórica. No entanto, o país que
> somos hoje mostra o quanto se avançou no domínio de uma plena democratização
> do arquipélago e da sua sociedade. Comparem o ontem e o hoje e vejam as
> diferenças abismais, o que já se conquistou.

Twenty years. In a historical perspective that's nothing. Yet the country we
are today shows how far we have progressed towards a full democratization of
this archipelago and its society. Compare yesterday and today and see the
colossal differences, what has already been accomplished.

In just a few months’ time, Cape Verdeans will have to put their country under
scrutiny once again, with the upcoming 2011 Presidential Elections. As
political figures rethink their strategies, citizens will have another chance
to practice democracy and set forth the country they envision through their
vote.
