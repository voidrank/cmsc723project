Through his blog, former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad
responded to the
[comments](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/race-relations-
better-if-singapore-not-turfed-out-says-lky/) of former Singapore Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew about the race relations and ‘racist politics’ in
Malaysia.

Below is an excerpt of The New York Times
[interview](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/09/transcripts-new-york-timesiht-
interview-lee-kuan-yew/) with Lee Kuan Yew

> I regret having been turfed out of Malaysia. I think if the Tunku had kept
> us together, what we did in Singapore, had Malaysia accepted a multiracial
> base for their society, much of what we’ve achieved in Singapore would be
> achieved in Malaysia. But not as much because it’s a much broader base. We
> would have improved inter-racial relations and an improved holistic
> situation. Now we have a very polarized Malaysia, Malays, Chinese and
> Indians in separate schools, living separate lives and not really getting on

Singapore was part of the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but separated from it
two years later.

Below is Mahathir’s [blog
reply](http://chedet.co.cc/chedetblog/2010/09/malaysia-according-to-lky.html):

> Racism in Malaysia is clearly the result of Singapore's membership of the
> country for just three years.
>
> Singapore's population is made up of 75 per cent Chinese and they own 95 per
> cent of the economy. It is therefore not a truly multi-racial country but a
> Chinese country with minority racial groups who are additionally much poorer
>
> In Singapore dissent is not allowed, People who contest against the PAP
> (author’s note: ruling political party) would be hauled up in court for
> libel and if they win elections would not be allowed to take their places in
> Parliament.
>
> …the party has always been led and dominated by ethnic Chinese and have won
> elections principally because of Chinese votes. The others are not even
> icing on the cake.

Dr. Boo Cheng Hau from Malaysia clarifies the real cause of
[disunity](http://potpouricauseway.blogspot.com/2010/09/mahatir-versus-lee-
kuan-yew.html) among Malaysians.

[Sayang Bangsa](http://dinmerican.wordpress.com/2010/09/14/mahathir-reacts-to-

correct

Mahathir and Lee are both known for being authoritative when they were still
in power. The two leaders are also old rivals who have been criticizing the
leadership of each other from time to time.
