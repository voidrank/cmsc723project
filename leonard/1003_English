There will be a presidential election in the Philippines next year. The
election season has already started with candidates filing their certificates
of candidacies in government election offices throughout the country.

To attract attention and to inform voters about their candidacy, presidential
candidates need to produce and pay for the airing of [TV
ads](http://www.spot.ph/2009/11/17/10-cheesy-political-tv-ads/). Several
videos of candidates have been airing on TV already in the past few months.
All of these TV ads were also uploaded on YouTube.

_Pinoy Picks!_ provides an [initial
list](http://pinoypicks.blogspot.com/2009/09/whos-running-
philippine-2010.html) of presidential candidates in the country. _Shalapog's
Blog_ [is not
satisfied](http://shalapog.wordpress.com/2009/11/09/2010-philippine-
presidential-candidates/) with the present crop of candidates:

> As you wake up in the morning you can start to smell that the season is fast
> approaching. You can see it in all corners of the street, the music on the
> radio, the busy people checking their list and including TV commercials. And
> here comes…the PRESIDENTIABLES!

> This 2010 election, I am not that excited about it because I am not

> However I do care about how the country would do with the next president.

Here are the TV ads of presidential candidates:

Senator Manny Villar wants to emphasize his humble beginnings:  

The young Senator Chiz Escudero plays a superhero  

Defense Secretary and administration candidate Gilbert Teodoro insists that
intelligence and competence are needed in government  

Senator Noynoy Aquino, and son of a former president, has the most star-
studded political TV ad- music video  

Former President Joseph Estrada is literally running again through a
commercial for an anti-arthritis capsule  

Scholar Danny Arao [reviews](http://asiancorrespondent.com/danny-arao-
blog/philippine-political-ads-strong-in-.htm) these ads:

> They are strong in form but lacking in substance. Even if they stress the
> need for genuine change there is no attempt to categorically express their
> stand on burning issues of the day.
>
> One can argue that they are just trying to introduce themselves to the
> public, but isn't it more endearing to the public if they immediately talk
> about specific problems like human rights violations and the failure of
> agrarian reform?

_Barrio Siete_ [dislikes](http://barriosiete.com/noynoy-ad-reminiscent-of-
nazi-propaganda/) political advertisements

> I hate political advertisements. To me it’s just a waste of money that
> should be spent elsewhere. I would like the candidates to spend their
> election funds on projects that would be beneficial to people in need.
>
> Officially, I have no candidates yet. I’m still busy looking through
> candidates with my personal magnifying glass. There are the political ads,
> with their shots at informing the electorate of their platform, if there
> ever was one, but mostly their faces and their attempt of projecting
> themselves as candidates, pathetic as it may be.
