A Facebook page entitled [“Support for Muammar al-Gaddafi from the people of
Serbia”](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Support-for-Muammar-al-Gaddafi-from-
the-people-of-Serbia/143360419060495) has become a show of support for the
controversial Libyan leader, with over 62,500 members. Libyan opposition
activists have also reported cyber attacks on opposition websites coming from
Serbia.

The cyber war has been initiated by pro-Gaddafi Serbian citizens, recruited
mainly from Serbian
[ultranationalists](http://www.rferl.org/content/serb_ultranationalists_rally_for_qaddafi/2348963.html),
has been reported [in the international
media](http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/world/SERBIA+SUPPORTS+GADHAFI/4522188/story.html).

The news has panicked the [Libyan Youth
Movement](https://www.facebook.com/LibyanYouthMovement)
([@shabablibya](http://twitter.com/#!/shabablibya)), a “group of Libyan Youth
both in and out of Libya inspired by our brothers and sisters in Egypt and
Tunis.”

Mohammed al-Sabah, a Libyan Youth Movement representative,
[said](http://www.smedia.rs/vesti/vest/60557/) [sr] to the Serbian media:

> Hiljade internet korisnika iz Srbije svakodnevno napada i obara naše sajtove
> ili ih toliko zagušuju sa anti-NATO i EU parolama, da su potpuno
> neupotrebljivi. Ne tvrdimo da su svi oni hakeri, ali je jasno da se radi o
> organizovanoj akciji. Ukoliko se nešto uskoro ne preduzme, stvari će postati
> sve gore po nas

Thousands of Internet users from Serbia are attacking and infringing on our
sites daily with anti-NATO and anti-EU slogans, so much that [the sites
become] completely useless. We do not claim that all of them are hackers, but
it is clear that it is an organized campaign. If something is not done soon,
things will get worse for us.

According to [Milan
Kovacevic](http://novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:324445-Srpski-
hakeri-protiv-NATO) [sr], a web administrator and author of the book
“Cryptography in Electronic Banking,” Serbian hackers are not independent in
their actions, but are a part of international groups:

> U pitanju su dve hakerske grupe „C1337ORG“ i „Crna ruka“. […] Dobar deo
> napadača su zapravo stranci, koji se kriju iza internet adresa običnih
> korisnika iz Srbije…

These are two of hacker groups: “C1337ORG” and “Black Hand.” […] A big part of
the attackers are actually foreigners who hide behind Internet address of
ordinary users from Serbia.

He adds that it is possible that among the Libyan rebels there are insiders
who are informing Serbian hackers where and how to attack.

The
[administrators](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=149729375090266&id=143360419060495)
[sr] of the most popular Serbian Facebook page deny any connections with
ultranationalists, explaining the essence of support for Gaddafi:

> Ako se neko pita zašto podržavamo Gadafija evo odgovora.  
>  Gadafi je slao naftu nama dok smo bili pod sankcijama.Gadafi nije priznao
> nezavisnost Kosova i prvi se pobunio.Gadafi je posle bombardovanja '99 slao
> pare za oporavak nase države.Gadafi je zapošljavao naše ljude kad’ ovde nisu
> imali šta da jedu.Gadafi se bori protiv ljudi koji su nam uništili
> detinjstvo.
>
> Zato smo uz njega!
>
> Pukovnice,pobedi zbog svih nas!

Gaddafi was sending oil to us when we were under economic sanctions. Gaddafi
did not recognize Kosovo's independence. After the bombing in 1999, he sent
money for Serbia's recovery. Gaddafi was providing employment to our people
while they had nothing to eat here. Gaddafi is fighting against the people who
have destroyed our childhood.

So we are with him!

Colonel, win for all of us!

(Because of this desert irrigation project, Belgrade's private Megatrend
University awarded Gaddafi an [honorary
doctorate](http://www.rferl.org/content/serbian_university_defends_qaddafi_doctorate/2326628.html)
in 2007. Some of Gaddafi's opponents in Serbia however, considered the move a
marketing trick to attract Libyan students to this university in the Serbian
capital.)

[Trese Babe

got this information from friends in Libya:

The NATO action in Libya has caused some young Serbs, who still live with the
memories of the [1999 NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia), to
react with hatred.

[Burek

[Ljubomir

suggested this:

The most rigorous critics are those Serbs who are disappointed with the
decision of the Serbian president Boris Tadić to publicly distance himself
from Gaddafi's government, “washing his own hands” of the long-term arms trade
with Libya.

[Vladimir Speed
Savic](http://https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=151059398290597&id=1778270279)
urges:

> Gaddafi, take from Tadic the Persian carpet you gave him last year for the
> [Day of the Libyan
> revolution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkNXY_8Bfh0&feature=related) And
> the honorary medal… Let Sarkozy weave him a new one at his own expense…

The administrator of the group posted a video uploaded to YouTube by [Radio
Television Vojvodina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M9Z2ynNY0I) of the time
when the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affair paid a visit to Gaddafi, thanking
him for not recognizing Kosovo. Foreign minister Vuk Jeremić and his group
performs a deep bow for Gaddafi in the clip.

Some of the Facebook page's members warn that the Serbian police and the
Serbian Inteliigence Agency [(BIA)](http://www.bia.gov.rs/) are monitoring
online activities in the well-known dictatorial style.

[Marko
Nikolic](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=151046571625213&id=1808727550)
posts this alarm:

> Twenty of them from BIA are here in this group and they are posting messages
> to the wall.

[Jebes Chuck Norris, Gaddafi ujedinio
Srbe](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=151059128290624&id=175096272537738)
reveals:

> We welcome the night shift of MUP [Ministry of the Interior] that monitors
> our group with fake profiles.

Bloggers on _Vujaklija.com_ also offer public support to the “defiant” Libyan
leader, as the Western media describe him.

[Cho-Seung Hui](http://vukajlija.com/gadafi/305604) says:

> The president who would welcome us to free ourselves forever from joining
> the European Union, democracy, the rule of human rights, privatization,
> globalization, capitalism and other disasters that have befallen us after
> the October 5, [2000].

[As_basket_player_5](http://vukajlija.com/moamer-gadafi/314820) concludes:

> Until a few days ago, a totally irrelevant figure in our lives, and now a
> hero in Serbia. Nobody knows why.
