This year East Timor has not experienced a normal dry season. Much of the
country has had rain all year, apparently a result of “[La
Niña](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni%C3%B1a)” (related to the “El Niño”
weather phenomenon). The capital Dili has repeatedly flash flooded. Local news
outlets have reported both crops destroyed by rains, and even more worryingly
that farmers have not planted this year in many places, as they are not used
to preparing fields in the rain.

East Timor at the best of times is a net food importer, not able to produce
surpluses to support city dwellers, and with a “hungry season” between crops.
But this year, the situation is quite dire.

[Blogger The Dili Insider provides a simple photographic
reminder](http://thediliinsider.blogspot.com/2010/11/dec-2008.html) that for
the past years in this season, East Timor has found itself in this situation,
waiting for ships with imported rice to arrive.

Since 2006, the government has been importing and subsidizing rice. In
previous years, there have been scandals related to these rice contracts (see
[Global Voices’ 2009 coverage of “The Ricegate
scandal”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/06/east-timor-ricegate-
scandal/)). It is not clear how much of the imported rice has ever reached
these isolated rural communities with food deficits – most appears to have
gone to town and city dwellers.

And given the serious situation facing Timorese farmers, the issue of food
imports and access to imported food has taken center stage once again.

Opposition blogger [Tatoli continues to criticize the ruling
coalition](http://odanmatan.blogspot.com/2010/09/governu-amp-nakonu-ho-ema-
karakter-aat.html) [Tet] on its rice importation policy:

> Maibé foos mak tama iha Timor-Leste tonelada ba tonelada mós Povu Timor-
> Leste barak mak la hetan foos ne'e nia oin. Povu Timor-Leste kiak tiha ona,
> foos mós folin karun tan fila fali, enkuantu Sr. Germano da Silva Lobato
> (ministra Lucia Lobato nia la'en) sa'e karreta Hummer bá-mai hodi soe rai-
> rahun ba Povu ki'ik-kiak.

But the rice that comes to Timor, ton after ton, many Timorese people never
even see it. The Timorese people are already poor, the rice prices go up
again, while Mr. Germano da Silva Lobato [Minister of Justice Lucia Lobato's
husband who got rice importation contracts] goes around in a Hummer kicking up
dust all over the meek, poor people.

Economist blogger Professor Almeida Serra believes that inflation in recent
months is linked to the availability of subsidized, imported rice. [He wrote
in late October [pt]](http://economia-tl.blogspot.com/2010/10/taxa-homologa-
de-inflacao-dili-em.html)

> Para a subida da taxa de inflação terá contribuído, nomeadamente, o quase

> respectivamente de 14,1%, 16%, 11,1% e 11,3%.

The near disappearance from the market of the subsidized “MTCI [Ministry of
the Tourism, Commerce and Industry] rice”, substituted by commercially
imported rice, has contributed to increased inflation. For example, the rate
of inflation for “cereals, tubers and their products” – where rice is counted,
representing a 13.1% of the basic needs basket – was from the months of June
to September respectively 14.1%, 16%, 11.1% e 11.3%

Bloggers report changes in the government's approach to rice. [Lita at
“Notisia Negosio” (Business News)
writes](http://notisianegosio.blogspot.com/2010/10/mtci-fo-hikas-knar-mercado-
ba-sector.html) [Tet]

> Iha fulan Outubru 2010 MTCI sei hamenus intervensaun foos iha merkado, tamba

In the month of October the Ministry of the Tourism, Commerce and Industry
[MTCI] will reduce its intervention in the rice market, because it has given
this back to businesspeople so that the MTCI can focus on emergency matters
and attend to those who live in places with poor access to markets (remote and
rural areas).

One thing is clear: there will be little margin of error in food supply in
East Timor over the coming months.

**Mosquito-borne illness**

Another potential impact of the rain is an increase in diseases transmitted by
mosquitoes like malaria and dengue. [The local media reported an upsurge in
children being hospitalized in the month of
October](http://timorlorosaenacaodiario.blogspot.com/2010/11/moras-labarik-
aumenta.html) [Tet], with both patients and hospital officials citing the
unceasing rains as a possible factor.

[The World Health Organization's regional tracking of dengue
](http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Dengue_Dengue_update_SEA_2010.pdf)revealed
that as of September in East Timor, more than two times as many cases had been
reported than in all of the previous year. Their briefing states:

> The exact reason for the apparent upsurge in reported cases in different
> countries is not completely clear, but weather patterns, especially relative
> increases in rainfall are very likely to be an important feature.

The Timorese Ministry of Health has set up a team called _Kondemal_ to “look
at the extraordinary prevalence [of disease] or outbreaks that can happen in
the rainy season”. [The Ministry announces on its
blog](http://saudesemanal.blogspot.com/2010/10/kondemal.html) [Tet]

> Ekipa Kondemal sei foti asaun seriu ba kazu extraordinaria nebe mosu iha
> tenpu udan. Liu husi servisu konjunta entre Ministeriu Saúde liu husi Saúde

> atendementu hanesan Fogin (Rega susuk), Abatisasi no intervensaun seluk mak
> hanesan liu husi atendementu SISCA ne’ebé hato’o husi Meja 4.

The _Kondemal_ team will take serious measures against extraordinary cases
that arise in the rainy season, through joint work between the central
Ministry of Health and District Health institutions, with local authorities to
reduce and get rid of these diseases through services like fumigation,
abatisasi [use of abate powder in stagnant water], and other interventions
like those treatment through the SISCA [mobile health clinics].

[Robin Taudevin's 2006 photos of malaria and dengue patients at Bairro Pite
Clinic](http://www.robintaudevin.com/tl_health/diseases_cs.html) are a
dramatic reminder of what an impact these diseases have, particularly on
children.
