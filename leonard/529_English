Five years ago, [Brigitte Bardot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BprvhH6hc_Q),
[President of the Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of
Animals](http://www.fondationbrigittebardot.fr/site/homepage.php?Id=2), sent a
[protest letter](http://la.indymedia.org/news/2005/09/135492.php) to the
Serbian President [Boris
Tadic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Tadi%C4%87), requesting him “to end
the revolting massacre of Serbia's stray animals”:

> […] Your people have shown their bloody and criminal behavior towards
> animals. Your capital is becoming, like Bucharest, a window of horror.
> Neither the Belgrade marathon, nor the 2005 euro basketball can justify this
> barbaric “cleaning”. You have the power to change all this and to restore
> Serbia's dignity. Push the elaboration of an animal welfare bill, which
> favours sterilization and vaccination campaigns for stray animals, similar
> to Greece and Turkey. Teach your people that animals, even strays, have the
> right to our respect and compassion. […]

At the time, this appeal was largely ignored by Tadic and other Serbian
officials. Now, however, the President happens to be one of the many Serbs who
want to adopt Mila, [a mutilated female
dog](http://pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/regioni/story/112121/Monstruozno:%20Vandali%20psu%20odsekli%20sve%20)
whose awful case [was covered on
GV](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/31/the-balkans-violent-treatment-
of-animals/) by Sinisa Boljanovic this past May).

President Tadic confronts Serbian mistreatment of animals, wants to adopt the
mutilated dog Mila

Yet, as a potential “adoptive parent,” the President of Serbia will have to
meet very stringent requirements prescribed by the [Secretariat for Municipal
Affairs](http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/200519/Odredjeni-kriterijumi-za-
usvajanje-keruse-Mile):

> Dog Mila must have 24-hour care and human presence. Adoptive parents must
> have a permanent and stable financial income due to the necessary medical
> care and enhanced nutrition. Mila must live with people who have a house
> with a yard – a natural space for rehabilitation – or an apartment with
> access to green outdoor areas. Also, an expert team of the veterinary
> institutions […] will have the right to conduct a medical examination of
> Mila once a month, and check how she is being treated.

While Mila the dog was rescued and became a symbol of the suffering of
Serbia's stray animals, the violence continues – and gets reported and
discussed in the local mainstream and citizen media.

Last week, a shocking photo of a massacred female dog lying in a pool of
blood, with her four puppies still suckling her, was published in the Serbian
daily [Alo](http://www.alo.rs/vesti/32813/Ubijena_kuja_koja_je_dojila_stence).
The police of the town of Zajecar are still searching for the unknown monster
who killed this dog.

In Belgrade's Pancevo bridge neighborhood, a 65-year-old man slit the throat
of [rottweiler
Rauf](http://www.alo.rs/vesti/26444/Pomazio_pa_zaklao_rotvajlera), a local
security dog, while walking with a friend and his little terrier. The
rottweiler, described as a very peaceful dog, approached them, not even
barking, and the killer patted it, then took out a knife and repeatedly
stabbed it. The wounded dog retreated to the gravel pits, where it bled to
death.

[Abazi Muhammad](http://www.alo.rs/vesti/26444/Pomazio_pa_zaklao_rotvajlera),
the man who used to feed Rauf, asked the killer why he did it – and got this
in response:

> Do you want me to kill you, too?!

A 2-year-old mixed-breed dog named
[Djole](http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/beograd/story/136501/BRUTALNO%3A+Pucao+psu+u+vrat.html)
was shot to death near the place where Mila the mutilated dog had been found.
A little boy who lives there found the dead dog – and also saw a hooded
stranger running away down the street.

A 32-year-old nurse from Pozarevac tied a dog to her car and dragged it down
several blocks (a distressing YouTube video of the incident is
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZh3POKrtCg)). The dog was severely
injured, but survived, and is now at a local animal shelter. The police filed
criminal charges against the woman; she refused to explain why she had
tortured the dog.

Children in Nis recorded a scene from horror films on their mobile phones: six
dogs previously strangled were hung on a tree. The children forwarded photos
to the association “Planet Zoo” with a request to discover the perpetrator of
the massacre. [Following a police
investigation](http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/181077/Decaci-okacili-mrtve-
pse-o-drvo), charges were filed against two juveniles, aged 17 and 15.

A Serbian dentist [Zubarica](http://www.zubarica.com/2010/11/kako-zubarici-
pomeriti-nerve.html) from Kraljevo witnessed how children were torturing a
cat:

> I was sitting at my desk in front of the window when I saw something flying
> towards the window, hitting the reinforced glass and falling down on the
> platform outside… A kitten! The poor thing was thrown at the glass like a
> ball, like a stone. I was so distressed I did not know what to say. The
> kitten was in pain, howling. I went out, but I only managed to see from afar
> the two persons who had “played” with the kitten – two boys, 6 years old or
> so. […] Where do I live? Who are these children's parents? Are they children
> at all? Are they human beings?

_Soulstormer_ replied:

> They are the mindless beasts whose parents never read Cinderella, Peter Pan,
> The Beauty and the Beast, Aesop's Fables and Andersen’s fairy tales to them.
> They began their childhood by killing virtual monsters in video games.

In 2008, for the first time in the Serbian judicial history, one person
received a 3-month prison sentence for killing animals. The rest of the 14
animal abuse cases, however, resulted in fines only.

[The Serbian Association of Friends of the Animals
(EPAR)](http://www.epar.org.rs/) stresses that the Serbian Criminal Code
should be more rigorous, as some of the domestic laws [(e.g., the Veterinary
Legal Code, Article 46 and 138)](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/serbia-
suffering/) support inhuman treatment of stray animals:

> In the Republic of Serbia, dogs and cats experience inhumane capture and
> death in a never ending attempt by authorities to control the stray animal
> populations of towns and cities.

EPAR [warns](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/serbia-suffering/):

> Death is administered in many ways by the Serbian government authorities:
>
> _1\. by paralysis of the respiratory system through T-61 injections into the
> heart or lungs […];  
>  2\. by injection of Nuvan and Kreozan poisons, causing death by
> suffocation;  
>  3\. by burying alive;  
>  4\. by clubbing to death […];  
>  5\. by sealing animals in plastic bags and disposing of them at garbage
> dumps;_

Professor [Ivan
Dimitrijevic](http://www.alo.rs/vesti/32837/Psihopata_ce_ubiti_ponovo), a
psychiatrist at Belgrade's Medical School, notes that those who torture and
kill animals belong to the group of deranged persons with a severe psychotic
disorder:

> If the person is weak and lonely, and does not seek help, he can do similar
> things to both people and animals. This person has to be urgently treated.
