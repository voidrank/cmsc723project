On January 14, US President Barack Obama signed into law a series of small
legislative reforms to the US embargo on Cuba. The reforms, [detailed
here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/14/reaching-out-
cuban-people), expand opportunities for travel from the US to Cuba, and will
allow US residents to send remittances to “non-family members” on the island,
provided that they are not senior government officials or senior members of
Cuba’s Communist Party. The reforms will make licenses for academic,
journalistic, and religious travel easier to obtain, and they will give US
colleges and universities greater freedom to engage with universities in Cuba
than they have at present.

Many in the US-Cuba blogging community hailed this as a small but significant
step in improving relations between the two countries. [The Havana Note’s Anya
Landau-
French](http://thehavananote.com/2011/01/obamas_new_cuba_travel_rules_ones_not_just_miami),
who has been following progress on the reforms closely, wrote:

> As long as this isn’t the end of the road but a new beginning – as President
> Obama promised in April 2009 – these new travel rules offer hope for that
> elusive progress in U.S.-Cuban relations.

Landau-French also noted that advocacy by constituencies ranging from
agricultural, to academic, to religious organizations, helped make these
reforms happen. The statement issued by the White House emphasized the
President’s goal of strengthening “people-to-people contact” between
independent citizens in Cuba and the US. [Phil Peters at The Cuban
Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2011/01/president-obamas-smart-
move.html) applauded this move. He wrote:

> The increase in contact between Americans and Cubans will expand the flow of
> information and ideas, and it will increase the income of Cubans in the
> country’s expanding private sector.

Other influential voices on US-Cuba policy criticized the reforms,
anticipating that their economic impact will only help to strengthen the
Castro government.

To underline this point, [Capitol Hill Cubans [en] compared the reforms to a
“bailout”](http://www.capitolhillcubans.com/2011/01/economics-of-obamas-new-
cuba-policy.html) of the Cuban government, which is undergoing a severe
economic crisis.

New Florida Senator Marco Rubio adamantly opposed the measures, describing
them as “weakening” U.S. policy towards Cuba. He wrote:

> I was opposed to the changes that have already been made by this
> administration and I oppose these new changes…It is unthinkable that the
> administration would enable the enrichment of a Cuban regime that routinely
> violates the basic human rights and dignity of its people.

Commenting on Rubio’s remarks, [El Yuma
said](http://elyuma.blogspot.com/2011/01/talented-mr-rubio-responds.html):

> Though he's just 39, on Cuba policy he seems committed to an approach of
> punishment and isolation that's been in place, and ineffective, since before
> he was born…I say: Instead of focusing solely on the ‘enrichment of the
> Cuban regime,’ why not focus on the empowerment of the Cuban people.

Across the Florida Straits, Cuban authorities and pro-government bloggers were
skeptical of the intentions behind the reforms. [Yohandry’s Weblog [es]
opined](http://yohandry.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/cuba-declaracion-del-
ministerio-de-relaciones-exteriores/) that while they demonstrated that US
residents want to engage with Cuba, they also reflect historically entrenched
paradigms of paternalistic dominance over Cuba.

> [La reforma es] expresión…del reconocimiento del fracaso de la política de
> los Estados Unidos contra Cuba y de que busca nuevas vías para lograr sus
> objetivos históricos de dominación de nuestro pueblo.
>
> […]
>
> Aunque las medidas son positivas, se quedan muy por debajo de esos justos
> reclamos, tienen un alcance muy limitado y no modifican la política contra
> Cuba.

[The reforms are] an expression of recognition of the failure of US policy
against Cuba, that finds new ways to achieve its objectives of historical
domination of our people.

[…]

Although the measures are positive, they remain well below what is fairly
deserved, they will bring very limited gains, and they do not change policy
towards Cuba.

But other voices from the island have pressed for just such measures in recent
months. In June of 2010, numerous bloggers, independent journalists, and civil
society leaders in Cuba signed a [letter urging the US Congress
[es]](http://convivenciacuba.es/intramuros/?p=79) to eliminate the travel ban
and allow for agricultural trade between the two countries, arguing that this
would help to improve the Cuban economy, and to strengthen relationships
between people on and off the island.

The letter stated:

> Compartimos la opinión de que el aislamiento del pueblo de Cuba beneficia a
> los intereses más inmovilistas del gobierno [cubano], mientras que la
> apertura sirve para informar y empoderar a los cubanos y ayudar a un mayor
> fortalecimiento de nuestra sociedad civil.

We share the opinion that the isolation of the Cuban people serves the
unchanging interests of the [Cuban] government, while an opening would serve
to inform and empower Cubans and to help further strengthen our civil society.

In a June 2010 post, [blogger Claudia Cadelo
[es]](http://octavocerco.blogspot.com/2010/06/mi-pobre-cabeza.html), who was
among those who signed the letter, wrote:

> Quizás sea ingenuo pensar que estas flexibilizaciones promoverían la
> democratización de Cuba, sin embargo, lo contrario termina por ser -cuando
> se le mira fríamente- igualmente naif.

Perhaps it is naïve to think that this liberalization would promote the
democratization of Cuba, but the contrary ends up being – when viewed coldly –
equally naïve.

Voices on all sides of the debate acknowledge that these policies will have
some impact on the island’s economy overall, as they will increase the flow of
US dollars to Cuban people. Any improvement in Cuba’s current economy will
likely benefit common citizens, government leaders, and everyone in between.
But whether these will have any impact on political or human rights issues in
Cuba, or help to improve US-Cuba relations on a greater scale, has yet to be
seen. [Cuba Central](http://cubacentral.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/breaking-
news-president-obama-expands-travel-to-cuba-movement-reported-in-the-case-of-
alan-gross/) commented that a change in in the United States’ approach to Cuba
policy might be the only way to proceed, if the US truly wants to move towards
a more open and mutually respectful relationship between the two nations. They
wrote:

> The U.S. needs to get out of the business of trying to overthrow or
> undermine Cuba’s government and to normalize the relationship through direct
> engagement. Cuba is undergoing significant changes in its own right. So
> should we.
