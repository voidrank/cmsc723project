Despite both its Christian and pagan origins,
[Halloween](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) in the United States has
become a time to watch scary movies, share candy with neighbors, and dress up
in costume… Unfortunately, as many bloggers this Halloween season pointed out,
those costumes are often at the expense of others.

This "illegal alien" costume was pulled from Target's shelves

One major blogosphere controversy occurred this Halloween over a costume that
poked fun at undocumented immigrants (also referred to, often degradingly, as
“illegal aliens”). The costume, dubbed “Illegal Alien,” featured an orange
prison jumpsuit, alien mask, and green card, and was initially sold at major
retailers, until the League of United Latin American Citizens and other
groups, [lobbied for its
removal](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-10-19-halloween-mask_N.htm).
Popular blog _Sociological Images_ broke down what was wrong with the costume,
[saying](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/31/further-othering-of-
undocumented-immigrants/):

> Several stores, including Target, Walgreens, and Amazon.com, offered an
> “Illegal Alien” costume for sale. The costume, which includes a orange
> (prison?) jumpsuit, a green card, and a space alien mask, conflates
> undocumented immigrants with aliens from outer space.

Amalia Pallares, writing for _Dissident Voice_ , saw the costume's appearance
as a teachable moment for her children,
[explaining](http://dissidentvoice.org/2009/10/illegal-alien-costume-a-
teaching-not-a-laughing-matter/):

> The truth is that I know too many faces, too many names, too many stories of
> detention, deportation, family separation and pain to “get” the generic
> illegal alien joke. Perhaps you know some too. It is time to teach our
> children that there is nothing laughable about the uncertain fate of 12
> million people and their families in a context of increasingly restrictive
> immigration policy, egregious human rights violations, massive fear, annual
> family separation and financial devastation of hundreds of thousands who are
> not wearing a mask, but are in fact exposed and vulnerable every day of
> their lives, cannot escape their circumstances, and cannot rely on the
> comfort provided by slipping out of a costume.

The alien costume wasn't the only controversy this Halloween. Frustrated by
the way women are portrayed in commercial Halloween costumes, a number of
bloggers remarked on this year's selection. Lisa at _Sociological Images_
noticed that Halloween has adult women dressing as little girls dressing as
adult women, providing several photographic examples, including the one to the
right. The blogger[ remarks](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/31/women-
dressing-up-like-little-girls-dressing-up-like-women/comment-
page-1/#comment-136974):

> The fact that many women dress up as sexy little girls points to both the
> sexualization of female children and the infantilization of adult women.

In yet another post, Lisa [points
out](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/31/halloween-costumes-and-social-
trends/) children's costumes that promote the sexualization of young girls.

Beyond the “illegal alien” issue, there were other costumes that got bloggers
talking about racism this year. Macon D of _Stuff White People Do_ shared a
bunch of pictures on his blog of racialized and racist Halloween costumes, and
also [shared a
suggestion](http://stuffwhitepeopledo.blogspot.com/2009/10/suddenly-get-
interested-in-non-white.html) for readers:

> So finally, if you're white, I have a suggestion. Aside from resisting any
> temptation you might have to somehow dress up like a member of another race
> or ethnic group — and thereby perpetuating stereotypes and running the risk
> of hurting other people — how would the following idea work for you?
>
> If you meet a white friend or acquaintance who's dressed up that way, you
> could say this to them: “Wow, what a concept! Where'd you get the idea of
> dressing up like a racist dipshit?”

Angry Asian Man comments on this wig, among others

Famed blogger [_Angry Asian Man_](http://www.angryasianman.com/angry.html), in
a [guest post](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/30/guest-post-asian-hair-
for-halloween/) for _Sociological Images_ , pointed out wigs for sale that
turned Chinese people into racial caricatures:

> But hey, why stop there? There are other fun and easy ways to be Chinese.
> Just try on the [Chinese Man](http://www.maxwigs.com/chinese-man-by-lacey-
> costume-wigs-p1598.html) wig, “an ancient style with bald front and long
> pigtail in the back.” But even at the low sale price of $41.48, the Chinese
> Man wig might just be a little outside your budget. That’s okay, because
> the[ Bargain Chinese Man](http://www.maxwigs.com/bargain-chinese-man-by-
> lacey-costume-wigs-p1602.html) wig is also available for just $22.05.
> Because nobody should miss out on the _racist_ mockery.

Native American blogger _Whebr Hotub_ may have summed up the problem best in a
blog post entitled, “My identity is not a costume for you to wear!” A
[quote](http://whebrhotub.blogspot.com/2009/10/my-identity-is-not-costume-for-
you-to.html):

> As a Native American, I am utterly appalled to see my culture lump together
