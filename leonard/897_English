While James Cameron's visually-stunning
_[Avatar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_\(2009_film\))_ (2009), a sci-fi
about earth-human's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to colonize another
planet, is [widely seen as expressively anti-
imperialist](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/nilegardiner/100020721/avatar-
the-most-expensive-piece-of-anti-american-propaganda-ever-made/), others claim
the movie – history's fastest to make a billion at the box office – contains
subtle racism against indigenous peoples.

_Telegraph_ blogger Will Heaven, who usually writes about politics, internet
and religion in the United Kingdom, [ charges the movie with racism and
Western left-wing
arrogance](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/willheaven/100020488/james-
camerons-avatar-is-a-stylish-film-marred-by-its-racist-subtext/):

_[Thinking for You](http://iffyrants.blogspot.com/2009/12/pocahantas-simba-
binks-meets-avatar.html)_ , a Florida-based blogger, agrees:

[Eric Ribellarsi](http://thefirecollective.org/Art-Culture/avatar-
condescending-racism-or-a-story-of-transformation-and-struggle.html), blogging
at _The Fire Collective: Fight Imperialism, Rethink and Experiment_ ,
disagrees:

> I found the movie to be a nuanced and beautiful film that told the story of
> an elitist white soldier for imperialism who goes to exploit and oppress an
> indigenous nation of aliens (the Na’vi), but is instead transformed by them
> and won to take up armed struggle against imperialism along side them.

Indigenous blogger _[Mindanaoan's
Narratives](http://maynunalsapaa.blogspot.com/2009/12/avatars-message.html)_
sees Avatar as “an activist’s dream movie” and draws parallels with problems
in her own homeland in the Philippines:

> The movie is also a reflection of the struggle of the indigenous peoples and
> rural communities in the hinterlands of Mindanao. Mining and other
> ‘development projects’ is linked with militarization and human rights
> violations; pitting lumads against lumads.

_[Jordan Poss Blog](http://jordanpossblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/lousy-movies-
avatar.html)_ , based in the U.S. state of Georgia, takes a different view:

> The equation of Na'vi with Native Americans is shameless and nauseating. Not
> because I think there's anything sacrosanct about the Indian
> experience–rather, the whole movie is so cloying and mawkish, the Na'vi so
> saintly and their earthly oppressors so evil I wanted to puke. This isn't
> storytelling, it's preaching. And lame preaching at that.

[_Asking the Wrong
Questions_](http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2009/12/avatar.html), an
Israel-based blog by Abigail Nussbaum, doesn't see the movie as romanticizing
indigenous peoples:

> When the film's production designer obliviously explains that making the
> film's Others blue-skinned aliens freed the filmmakers to tell a story that
> would have been considered racist if told about humans, and doesn't see the
> problem in what he's saying despite the fact that the only thing
> distinguishing those aliens from stereotypical Native Americans is their
> blue skin, what is there for a humble blogger to add?
