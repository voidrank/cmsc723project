Twitter has played an instrumental role in keeping the world abreast of the
latest developments in Egypt, where demonstrations against the 30-year rule of
president Hosni Mubarak have entered their fourth day.

The following widget shows Twitter content mentioning the hashtag #jan25 over
the last three days, and are all related to terms mentioned in people's
Twitter messages:

One of the most commonly shared terms ‘Tear Gas’ spiked earlier today when the
armed forces utilized tear gas bombs, along with rubber bullets, against the
crowds in the streets:

Al Jazeera has been playing a key role in covering the events as they
unfolded, broadcasting live from Cairo:

The United Arab Emirate's
[@sultanalqassemi](http://twitter.com/sultanalqassemi) is one of the key
Twitter users spreading realtime updates from across Egypt:

As the effects of the demonstrations spread across the region, we see a huge
spike in Twitter data because of an unconfirmed claim that Internet has been
blocked in Syria:
