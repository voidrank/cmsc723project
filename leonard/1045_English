The [Chacaltaya mountain range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacaltaya)
contains some of the most symbolic peaks in Bolivia's Andes Mountains. As it
once was one of the only places to snow ski in this mountainous country, these
mountains are well-known to those in the Department of La Paz, as well as
foreign adventurers. The mountains have also hosted charity football matches
in which Bolivian President Evo Morales participated, seeking to prove that
the sport can be played at high altitudes.

However, Chacaltaya's glacier has been receding at a worrisome and rapid pace.
The effects of climate change on this glacier and others in the region have
been part of the investigation by Higher University of San Andrés professor
Edson Ramírez, [who concludes a direct connection
[es]](http://revistavirtual.redesma.org/vol5/articulo6.php?id=c1) between
global warming and the disappearance of the glacier.

Ramírez and his team have also been studying another nearby glacier that is
undergoing similar changes and about the effect on the local population. The
Tuni Condoriri glacier is melting at a rapid pace, affecting alpine
enthusiasts, but also affecting a vulnerable migrant population that depends
on it for drinking water and agricultural activities.

The reservoir that collects the water from[ the glacier provides 80% of the
drinking water to the city of El Alto and the outskirts of La
Paz](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6496429.stm). According to the most
recent census, [El Alto has a population of 827,000 people
[es]](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Alto), which is increasing every year at
a rate of 5.1% per year. According to journalist and blogger Mónica Oblitas,
[this rate is more than double the national average
[es]](http://monioblitas.blogspot.com/2008/06/glaciar-nuestro-tesoro-se-
derrite.html). Experts are predicting water shortages and a premium for water,
[with some people predicting that water rationing is imminent
[es]](http://observadorglobal.com/bolivia-un-futuro-sin-agua-informe-
especial-n45.html). The team from _Observador Global [es]_ (Global Observer)
[created a 6-part video series about the effects of future water shortages in
this region](http://observadorglobal.com/bolivia-un-futuro-sin-agua-informe-
especial-n45.html).

The city is home to [migrants from the Aymara indigenous communities on the
Bolivian Altiplano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Alto), who settle in El
Alto, often in impoverished conditions. Bolivian blogger Cristina Quisbert of
the blog _Indigenous Bolivia_ [describes the situation that many residents
face in terms of suitable drinking
water](http://boliviaon.blogspot.com/2009/09/our-mountains-melt.html):

> Additional conditions difficult access to water. A lot of people arrive from
> rural area to El Alto and establish wherever they can. Because of lack of
> money, they live in neighborhoods where there is neither drinkable water nor
> sewer system. Some of them dig a hole which should be about three metres

However, the Tuni Condoriri, not only provides drinking water to the city, but
it also provides valuable water for agricultural activities on the Altiplano.
If sustainable agricultural activities decrease because of the lack of water,
many more rural residents may seek opportunities in El Alto, where they may
face similar water shortages, while raising demand.

350.org activists climb to the Chacaltaya glacier in Bolivia in preparation
for a major event on October 24. Photo used under a Creative Commons license.

It is the high-profile image of the Chacaltaya glacier that is drawing
attention from local government official and other activist groups to the
problem of climate change in the Bolivian Occident. [A recent local event
associated with the 350.org campaign was advertised on Facebook
[es]](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=173999981920&ref=nf), inviting
Bolivians to take an excursion to the Chacaltaya glacier to see for themselves
the effects.

Finally, Oblitas [concludes with the following questions
[es]](http://monioblitas.blogspot.com/2008/06/glaciar-nuestro-tesoro-se-
derrite.html):

> Chacaltaya ya no está y pronto dejarán de existir otros glaciares, ¿está el
> país preparado para esas pérdidas?, ¿somos conscientes de la importancia de
> tomar un rol activo e inmediato contra el calentamiento? Para muchos, el
> cambio climático no es un fenómeno global y no creen sentirse afectados,
> pero lo cierto es que absolutamente todos estamos en riesgo y no todos
> podemos enfrentarlo en las mismas condiciones. La lucha continúa, aunque ya
> sea tarde para lugares como Chacaltaya.

Chacaltaya is no longer around and soon, other glaciers will cease to exist.
Is the country prepared for these losses? Are we aware of the importance of
taking an active and immediate role against global warming? For many, climate
change is not a global phenomenon and do not feel affected, but truely,
everyone is at risk and not everyone can face it in the same conditions. The
struggle continues, even though it is too late for places like Chacaltaya.
