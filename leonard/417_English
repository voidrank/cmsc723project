Thumbs up for Mideast Tunes website for featuring Middle Eastern musicians who
wish to incite social change. Particularly now that social change is taking
place throughout the region. Just last month, right before the Tunisia revolt
which managed to remove the President, a musician known as The General [was
arrested](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/06/tunisia-activists-
arrested-at-sidibouzid-protests-on-january-6/). The motive? His song
[President, Your People Are Dying](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeGlJ7OouR0
"President, Your People Are Dying").

You can listen to Rebel, by the Arabian Knightz through the player displayed
at the end of this post. According to their page, the song is free to
download, stream, play and distribute; it is available on the [Mideast Tunes
