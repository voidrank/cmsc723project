There is an invisible minority in Bangladesh. They are generally underground
and their opening up in public is uncommon. For homosexual communities, their
sexual orientation makes them criminals in their own country. Besides not
being able to exercise their rights, the [LGBT community in
Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Bangladesh) faces
discrimination, verbal abuse, physical abuse and social challenges. The
country does not recognize a marriage, civil union or domestic partnership
between adults of the same sex.

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOuSeXJXqgk) directed by Tanvir
Alim and Arifur Rahman speaks on behalf of the Bangladeshi LGBT population who
are almost invisible to the wider society. The interviews tell the story of
their plights, belief, emotions and a silent resilience.

When Shawn Ahmed, a Bangladeshi-Canadian blogger, came out of the closet in a
series of videos he got negative reactions from the family [as documented
here](http://www.queerty.com/watch-bangladesh-activist-comes-out-in-live-web-
stream-20130102/). [Tonmoy
Hasan](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/tonmoy_hasan/29505981) expresses
[bn] fear about his homosexuality in context of the conservative society:

> বাংলাদেশের বয়স্ক সমকামীদের জীবন দেখে আমার করুণা হয়। তারা বিয়ে করেছে,
> তাদের বাচ্চাকাচ্চাও আছে। তারা তাদের অফিসের কিংবা বাসার অবসরটুকু কাজে লাগায়
> পার্টনার হান্টে। কেউ যদি ইন্টারেস্টেড হয় তাহলে তারা কোন হোটেলে এক ঘণ্টার
> জন্য রুম ভাড়া করে, সেক্স করে, তারপর যে যার পথে চলে যায়। তাদের অসহায়ত্ব
> দেখে আমি সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছি যদি আমার পুরো জীবনও একা থাকতে হয় তবে তাই সই।
> কিন্তু এভাবে প্রহসনের মাধ্যমে আমি কিছু মানুষের জীবন ধ্বংস করবো না।

> and go on to live their separate lives. Seeing all this I have decided if I

[Rainer Ebert](http://mukto-mona.com/wordpress/?p=1631) posts a number of case
studies and writes about a young journalist:

> Shakhawat felt romantically attracted towards men for as long as he can

> in Dhaka’s gay scene. He became a member of Boys of Bangladesh (BoB), a
> platform for gay men, and learned a great deal about the psychology and
> politics of sexual orientation. Shakhawat has been in a steady and committed
> relationship with another man for four years. He wants to stay in Bangladesh
> to raise awareness for LGB issues.

The internet has been an invaluable source of support and advice, and played a
significant role in providing space for homosexuality in Bangladesh. A [recent
report](http://newsbd24online.blogspot.com/2012/11/blog-post_4853.html) [bn]
explains how homosexual men and women are resorting to different online
communities for dating and finding partners. [Boys Of
Bangladesh](http://www.boysofbangladesh.org/history_of_e-group.html), one of
the pioneer online gay communities in Bangladesh, describes how the online
communities evolved from IRC chatrooms, group mails, forums to Facebook pages.
There are also [English](http://lgbtbangladesh.wordpress.com/) and
[Bengali](http://somodhikar.blogspot.com/) blogs promoting news and views
about LGBT rights.

Blogger Avijit Roy published a book in Bengali titled “[Homosexuality, A
Scientific and Socio-psychological Investigation](http://mukto-
mona.net/Articles/avijit/shomokamita/)” and a number of chapters from that
book have been published online in different blogs. This is the first book in
Bengali to deal with LGBT people and their human rights. The book aims to
remove the stereotyping and stigma about the LGBT communities in Bangladesh by
explaining what homosexuality is and to address the issue from a human rights
perspective.

[Sabuzpatra](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/shoebul/29542027) wants [bn]
homosexuals in Bangladesh to be legally and socially accepted. The blogger
thinks it will contribute in decreasing the growth rate in over-populous
Bangladesh. The LGBT rights movement in Bangladesh is growing rapidly and the
[voices for decriminalization are becoming
louder](http://www.weeklyblitz.net/1258/lgbt-community-calls-for-the-repeal-
of-section-377).

However bloggers like [Darashiko](http://prothom-aloblog.com/posts/7/101974)
[bn] are against homosexuality and think people need to know about its
negative aspects and the hatred against it should be kept alive.

Blogger [Opobak](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/kkk/28885485) wonders
[bn]:

> সমকামী মানুষকে যদি আইনী অধিকার প্রদান করা হয় বাংলাদেশে তবে বাংলাদেশের সমাজে
> কতজন স্বাধীন ভাবে ঘোষণা করবে তারা সমকামী এবং এমন একজন কি পাওয়া যাবে যে এই
> অধিকার অক্ষুন্ন রাখবার জন্য আদালতে উপস্থিত হবে?

> Even if there are legal recognition of homosexuals I wonder how many in
> Bangladesh can freely declare their orientation and would there be anybody
> to fight for their rights in the court?
