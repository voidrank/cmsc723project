Kazakhstan’s bloggers continue to monitor the state’s traditionally non-
transparent politics and comment on the news. Among their concerns is the
government’s announcement that due to the economic crisis, wage increases for
state employees, pensioners and students on stipend, scheduled for the
beginning of 2010, would have to be postponed for six months. However, these
difficulties will not affect the country’s new capital, which President
Nazarbaev considers his personal project.

The country’s attitude towards the capital is ambivalent. In official
propaganda, it is regarded as a symbol of the republic’s flourishing. Among
themselves, people grumble about it – billions of dollars spent on bizarre
architectural experiments like the [Palace of Peace and
Reconciliation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Peace_and_Reconciliation)
or the [Khan Shatyry Entertainment
Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Shatyry_Entertainment_Center), while
problems with potable water and electricity persist. However, a decade of
massive investment could not have gone without results, and the city is
beginning to acquire a “human” feel.

All big politics is now done in Astana, but, unlike the super-modern cityscape
in which this process takes place, the methods of government are increasingly
reminiscent of soviet gerontocratic stagnation. Alim-atenbek
