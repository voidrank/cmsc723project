The works of Venezuelan artist[ Jesús Soto (1923 –
2005)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Soto) are among the most famous
representations of Latin American modern art, known mostly for his kinetic
works. Soto was born in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela, where he began working as a
painter of cinema posters. He received his education in the cities of Caracas
and Maracaibo, but it was in Paris where his career took a powerful turn. His
most famous works are the “penetrables,” which are interactive sculptures
consisting of an array of square, thin, dangling tubes of shiny colors made
from plastic and in which the public can walk through.

According to the art experts, Soto's art is inseparable from the viewer, who
is an active participant of the artist’s piece. The illusion and the senses
are completed by the perceptions of the mind as a result of observing,
touching, and becoming part of the piece. Venezuelan bloggers and the online
community in general, celebrate his art through articles, reviews, and videos
taken in museums and inside the works themselves, while explaining the meaning
of Soto’s works in their culture, landscape and daily life.

In his blog [_Literanova [es]_](http://
"http://literanova.eduardocasanova.com/index.php/2009/09/24/jesus-soto-y-el-
cinetismo-conceptos-e-hi"), Eduardo Casanova goes a bit deeper on Soto’s life
and gives an insight of the history of the city he was born:

> Jesús Rafael Soto nació en Venezuela, en 1923, en una población cargada de
> historia: Ciudad Bolívar, donde se instituyó la prensa escrita y se fraguó
> la creación de la llamada Gran Colombia (…) Era una población aislada, sin
> museos ni actividades del arte. El mismo ha dicho que aprendió solo el arte
> de la pintura. Deja su ciudad natal y viaja a Maracaibo, en el occidente del
> país, para encargarse de la dirección de una escuela de artes plásticas. En
> 1950 se va a París y allí comienza su carrera de artista creador de nuevas
> formas.

Jesus Soto was born in 1923 in a city full of history: Ciudad Bolívar, where
the press was released for the first time in the country and the creation of
the Great Colombia was conceived. This was an isolated population, with no
museums or art activities. He used to say that he learned how paint by
himself. He left his birth town and went to Maracaibo, in the western part of
the country to be Director of a school of Arts. In 1950, Soto went to Paris
and that is where he started the creation of new forms (of art).

an example of an experience walking through a piece exhibited in the Jesús
Soto Museum, in Ciudad Bolívar:

The blog [_Talento Venezolano [es]_](http://
"http://talentovenezolano.blogspot.com/2007/01/jess-soto-venezolano-
universal.html") also dedicates a space to talk about the artists and his most
famous creations:

> En 1967 creó la primera obra de la serie Penetrables, la cual consiste en
> instalaciones de tubos de plástico a través de los cuales el espectador se
> siente en un espacio mágico. Ambas obras que pudieron admirarse en el Museo
> de Arte Moderno, en el Grand Palais y el Centro Pompidou de París.

In 1967 (Soto) created the first of his “Penetrables”, which are plastic tubes
through which the spectator can feel him/herself in a magical space. Both
works were exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, the Grand Palais and the
Pompidou Center in Paris.

You Tube has also been a way for people to show their contact and emotions
while interacting with Soto’s works. Children in particular, have had a
special approach to the artistic experience inside the artist’s work, which
has been shown and shared through these videos:
