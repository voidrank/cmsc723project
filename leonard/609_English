This year Mexico will commemorate [the
bicentennial](http://english.bicentenario.gob.mx/) of its
[Independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_independence) from the
Spanish Crown and the centennial of its
[Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_revolution) with an
extensive program of events. Every year, the entire nation celebrates late
into the night of September 15th (and early on the 16th) a renewal of the
famous call for a revolution, which is likely to take place in city halls all
over the country. Mexicans living abroad will celebrate this act as well,
whether in national embassies or at renowned Mexican restaurants or bars.

But this year is supposed to be special, it is supposed to be something that
will be “better than anything we have seen before,” as many have predicted.

A few days ago, President Felipe Calderon gave a speech in which he called all
Mexicans to unite during the celebrations, regardless of their different views
in terms of religion, politics and attitudes on the subject of the
bicentennial. But the date is only a celebration for some; the bicentennial
has become a complex subject that has led to different opinions and reactions.
Even _[The New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/world/americas/13bicentennial.html?_r=1&hp)_
noticed: Randal C. Archibold wrote, “There are the bicentennial buses.
Bicentennial roads. A bicentennial marathon. A bicentennial song. The
bicentennial digital library. A bicentennial video game. Even a bicentennial
bird, the mountain trogan, and plant, the owl agave. And of course the
bicentennial fireworks extravaganza, planned to be the largest the country has
ever seen. What appears to be missing is bicentennial enthusiasm.”

It is well-known that the government is spending great amounts of money on
this celebration, while there are other issues that Mexicans consider are more
important than spending [580 million
pesos](http://foros.eluniversal.com.mx/w_detalle.html?tdi=8&rtdi=10001)
(approx. 50 million dollars) in only one celebration –in only one night.
Protests have taken place, and people are responding to the spending amid drug
dealing problems, organized crime, migration and a lack of employment and
schools.

[_El Universal [es]_ ,](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/noticias.html) a Mexican
newspaper, [started a discussion to see what readers thought about the
government spending that amount of money on the bicentennial celebration
[es]](http://foros.eluniversal.com.mx/w_detalle.html?tdi=8&rtdi=10001). These
are some of the responses they got:

> Creo que en estos momentos no estamos para festejar nada,tomando en cuenta
> que en otro estados de la republica,estan pasando por inundaciones y todo
> ese dinero se deberia aplicar en ayuda a esos lugares y la”celebracion” del
> bicentenario dejarlo para otra ocasión. (Esteban Flores García)

I believe that in this moment, it is not a good time to celebrate anything. In
other states in the nation, there is flooding and all of this money should go
for these situations and the bicentennial “celebration” should happen in
another occasion. (Esteban Flores Garcia)

> Para nada se justifica tanto gasto del gobierno, hay necesidades muy grandes
> en el pais que podrian ser apoyadas con ese tanto dinero que se va a
> gastar(Raul López M)

There is no justification for all the money the government is spending, there
are very big necessities that the country could support with the cash they
will spend (Raul López M)

> Yo siento que como Mèxicano da gusto el festejar el bicentenario, pero
> desgraciadamente los festejos se ven opacados por tanta inseguridad y
> delincuencia, recordemos lo que paso en Morelia Mich. con las granadas,
> ademas como justificar un gasto tan exesivo habiendo otras prioridades en el
> pais. (JOSE FRANCISCO)

I feel like, as a Mexican, it is good to celebrate the bicentennial, but sadly
these celebrations are overshadowed by insecurity and crime, let's remember
what happened in Morelia, Mich. with the grenades, as well as justifying the
excessive spending. We know there are priorities in our country (JOSE
FRANCISCO)

On twitter, Mexican users also expressed their thoughts on the celebration of
the bicentennial. With a positive attitude, Bernarda Jimenez (@b3rsita)
[expresses her wish to get Mexican food [es]
](http://twitter.com/b3rsita/status/24490064316)in this special day:

I want it to be the 15 already, so that I can #eatlikeprecious in this de-li-
ciuos bicentennial!!!

Another user, Zuza-ku (@zuzaku22) talks about her [personal concern on the
difficult situation the country is facing
[es]](http://twitter.com/zuzaku22/status/24490808230):

> En el [#bicentenario](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23bicentenario
> "#bicentenario") lamento y lloro cada una de las muertes presentes y

In this #bicentennial I regret and cry each and every single death that
happened and that will happen.

Finally, echoing what others have expressed, user[ Ariadna
[es]](http://www.blogger.com/profile/00973319158144368091) in her blog _[Blog
de Ariadna [es]](http://ariadnabb.blogspot.com/)_ writes about her opinion on
[Mexico's Bicentennial celebration and what is happening inside the nation
[es]:](http://ariadnabb.blogspot.com/2010/09/bicentenario-de-mexico.html)

> Se que es importante celebrar que somos un país “libre” y “soberano” pero,

> solo piensan en como “darnos atole con el dedo” con estos festejos… ojala
> paremos un momento y nos demos cuenta que realmente no hay mucho que

I know that it is important to celebrate that we are a “free” and “sovereign”
country but, this [money] could have been invested on necessary things,
poverty is a growing evident issue, and crime floods our streets, and our
politicians only think about how to give us “ _atole_ with the finger”
(meaning cheat or mislead) with these celebrations…I hope that we can stop for
a moment and realize that there is not much to celebrate, and not much to feel
proud for.
