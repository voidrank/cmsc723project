Street artists and musicians broaden their public when they come into contact
with citizen media. In Venezuela, where music and theater are parts of daily
life, traffic, and buses, a number of citizen journalists share their
experiences when they meet with artists that bring color to urban life.

Similarly, these very artists prepare short videos and documentaries in which
they show performances of various street musicians.

In this video, recorded by the artists themselves for the festival of street
singers, you can see musicians that come together in various cities throughout
the country:

Meanwhile, Cinetica13 shares a very popular street musician's performance in
the city of [Mérida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_M%C3%A9rida).

Theater also has its place in the Venezuelan street art world. On his YouTube
account, Perucho Morales shares performances by the “Comediantes” group, also
in Mérida.
