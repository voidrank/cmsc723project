Thought it was worth capturing some of the early reactions in the Australian
blogosphere to the
[Libya](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/libya-uprising-2011/)
No-Fly Zone and intervention. The Australian government has been a [strong
supporter](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/21/3169180.htm) of the
UN resolution.

_Hoyden About Town_ ’s tigtog has an open thread:

> The Libyan people deserve support in overthrowing their tyrant and
> protection against his threats of retaliation and further repression,
> absolutely. But why do the people of Bahrain, Syria and Yemen apparently
> deserve less from the governments of the West? Is it just that their despots
> are perceived to wear a slightly less alarming face? Will the intervention
> in Libya do all that humanitarians wish for it to do? How full hearted is
> the West’s support for this unprecedented ‘Arab Spring’?

_Public Opinion’_ s Gary Sauer-Thompson questions the goals of the
intervention:

> What is political endgame here? What is the role the U.S. or the Europeans
> might be expected to play should Qaddafi fall? What steps will follow should
> the No Fly Zone and indirect intervention not succeed in driving Qaddafi
> from power? The best answer is regime change — displacing the Gaddafi
> government of Libya and replacing it with a new regime built around the
> rebels.

At his self-titled blog, Middle East commentator Anthony Loewenstein has been
a strong voice against the no-fly zone and accompanying air assault:

> [Hillary Clinton is pushing for a
> war](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/03/the-
> questions-to-which-obama-has-no-answers.html) with absolutely no clue what
> may happen.

> Shame on all the Western journalists and commentators cheering on the no-fly

> something](http://web.overland.org.au/2011/03/nfzs-and-other-benevolent-

_Duckpond_ was faster off the mark than the NFZ coalition. His concerns stop
short of opposing the intervention:

> The purpose of the attack was to stop Gaddafi using aerial bombing,
> artillery and tank fire against civilian targets. What happens when the
> aerial attacks are called off? Is this precedent going to be followed from
> now on when civilians are subject to military attacks? My sense is that the
> scale and intensity of the aerial attacks are disproportionate to the
> intended objectives.

And they are just some of the progressive bloggers.

Peter at _Qohel_ self-styled as ‘Australia's Leading Independent Conservative
Blog’ questions this apparent hypocrisy by the left:

> But how is using force to bring about regime change in Libya OK, when using
> force to bring about regime change in Iraq was not OK, was about oil, meant
> that George Bush was Satan, or acting for the bushitlerchimphalliburton
> global industrial machine?
>
> … No matter what the outcome, no matter how good the West’s intentions, no
> matter how free of commercial imperatives, no matter how driven by
> humanitarian concern, 1500 years of history tell us we will come out looking
> like the villains.

Even right wing _Herald Sun_ journalist Andrew Bolt seems equivocal:

> l’m all in favor of preventing a massacre of civilians, but what is the end
> game here?
>
> … Are the allies happy if Gaddafi staying in control of Libya, apart from
> the rebel’s enclave around Benghazi? How long will this no fly zone be
> imposed?
>
> There seems to have been little of the debate about effectively declaring
> war on Gaddafi as there was about declaring war on Saddam. And there are
> much fewer Western security interests at stake, too – no WMD programs, no
> funding of terrorists, no history of invading neighbors.

At News Corporation’s blog site _The Punch_ , Thom Woodroofe is having the
pragmatist’s bet each way:

> Military options should always be a last resort. But realistically what else
> was there that we could do?
>
> We should remember that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is
> for good men to do nothing and hold our breath that Gaddafi will back down
> soon before any escalation occurs.

Yesterday a friend asked me if an anti-intervention rally was planned for
Melbourne this week. I could not find any mention of one on the web. Perhaps
he should contact _Indymedia_ where an anonymous writer gives reason for
opposing the intervention:

> As a leftist who supports the inspiring democracy uprising in Libya I was
> very disturbed to see the start of military action by France, Britain and
> the U.S. Let me be crystal clear from the start, I believe Gaddaffi to be an
> odious ruthless dictator who has no legitimacy and violently oppresses his
> own people. However I do not believe the intervention is a good thing for
> the following reasons…
>
> [Why military action in Libya is
> wrong.](http://www.indymedia.org.au/2011/03/21/why-military-action-in-libya-
> is-wrong)
