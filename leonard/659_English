Yesterday, August 1, marked the 172nd commemoration of Emancipation Day in
many English-speaking Caribbean territories, [when African slaves were freed
from their British colonists](http://www.gallimaufry.ws/1071/). Today is a
public holiday in many countries throughout the region and a few bloggers are
taking the opportunity to reflect on what the occasion means to these
developing islands, [while asking the
question](http://meppublishers.blogspot.com/2010/08/happy-emancipation-
day.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+meppublishers+%28MEP+Publishers+Blog%29):
“How close are we in the Caribbean to truly being ‘free'?”

Jamaican diaspora blogger [Geoffrey
Philp](http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/2010/08/emancipation-
day-2010.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FEVfd+%28Geoffrey+Philp%27s+Blog+Spot%29)
offers a quick history of Emancipation, noting that:

> In many Caribbean countries the Emancipation Day celebration is a part of
> Carnival, as the Caribbean Carnival takes place at this time.

_Trinidad and Tobago News Blog_ [, meanwhile,
republishes](http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/blog/?p=4140) the Prime
Minister's Emancipation Day message and [covers the local
celebrations](http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/blog/?p=4149) via a
comprehensive list of related mainstream media stories.

> It is a day worthy of a public holiday.

He goes on to provide links “of interest on the subject of slavery and the
resolve of a few people to see that despicable policy come to an end.”

Fellow Bahamian _[Womanish
Words](http://womanishwords.blogspot.com/2010/08/emancipation-day-
meditation.html)_ , in one of the most thoughtful posts about the occasion,
ruminates on the meaning of the day and the stark reality of modern day
slavery:

> This holiday weekend we celebrate the end of slavery, remember those who did
> not survive, and those that did, because they are our sacred ancestors. We
> pause to consider the many huge and small freedoms we enjoy today and raise
> our glasses and voices to them with gratitude.
>
> And if we are brave, today we will think and speak of the people in the
> world who are still not free, maybe speak out for them, because they are us,
> and none of us are really free until all are free. I’m thinking about the
> estimated two million human beings, most of them women and girls, who will
> be trafficked around the world this year. Some say it will be as many as
> four million…the struggle isn't over for so many women and girls of our
> generation. If we are free enough to celebrate today, sisters, lets do it in
> the name of those of us who are not.
