David Roth, Fiji Water’s local representative, was kicked out of Fiji because
he was interfering with the country’s internal affairs, says military leader
Frank Bainimarama.

Bainimarama, speaking over the weekend during a trip to China, said Roth was
acting in contradiction to his work visa. He did not elaborate on details, but
Fiji’s leader [said](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/banished-
fiji-water-boss-was-interfering-says-bainimarama/story-e6frg6nf-1225958005320)
the representative to the US-based premium water firm was “had been acting in
a manner prejudicial to good governance and public order by interfering in the
domestic affairs and governance of Fiji.”

Since Roth left the country November 18, Fiji’s government has tried to paint
the squabble as an issue between an individual and the state. Permanent
Secretary for Information, Sharon Smith-Johns
[said](http://www.fijivillage.com/?mod=story&id=231110cbed199fd5078beb1c35c416)
the government was not targeting the multi-million dollar water company that
bears the country’s name. She also reassured the business community of the
islands’ favorable investment climate.

**Taxing situation**  
Fiji Water began distributing to the United States in 1997 and can now be
found in 40 countries. The company was bought for an
[estimated](http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/Hollywood-couple-buys-Fiji-
Water-for-63m/2004/11/29/1101577419156.html) $50 million USD in 2004 by the US
billionaires Stewart and Lynda Resnick. That year it won the US Secretary of
State’s Award for Corporate Excellence for bringing sustainable jobs to Fiji.
Fiji Water currently ships $150 million USD per year, employs 350 local
workers and spends an estimated $1.3 million USD a year on development
projects. “However, this is a lot less than the 30 per cent corporate tax it
would normally pay,” Hamish McDonald
[wrote](http://www.smh.com.au/world/minister-resigns-in-row-over-bottled-
water-20101118-17zcz.html) in the Sydney Morning Herald.

Fiji’s government originally provided the start-up company with tax free
status until 2008. That year the Bainimarama government proposed 20 cent per
litre tax over all water bottled in the country. Bottlers bristled at this and
Fiji Water [shut down](http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=95907) its plant
in the Yaqara valley for a few days during the dispute, which the government
eventually backed down. With a $150 million bond payment coming due next year
for Fiji’s government, McDonald
[speculates](http://www.smh.com.au/world/minister-resigns-in-row-over-bottled-
water-20101118-17zcz.html) Bainimarama could be re-thinking the tax plan.

However, the action is not unanimous. Ratu Epeli Ganilau, Fiji’s minister of
Defense and Immigration, resigned from the government, claiming differences
stemming from the Roth affair. Rumors persist that he was ordered to sign
Roth’s deportation papers and refused.

**Paradise for business?**  
Crosbie Walsh, author of _Fiji: The Way it Was, Is and Can Be_ ,
[said](http://crosbiew.blogspot.com/2010/11/gripes-of-roth-permanent-
per-f1m-thiefs.html) the government did itself a great disservice in the Roth
affair.

Walsh does concede that this situation could be similar to the recent
[standoff](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/business/media/28hobbit.html?_r=1&ref=warner_bros_entertainment_inc)
between Warner Brothers and the government of New Zealand over the US-based
entertainment company's refusal to pay taxes (and follow labor laws) if it
decided to make two films based on the Hobbit in the country. In the end, the
government ceded to many of Warner Bros. demands to keep production in New
Zealand.

In _Fiji Board Exiles_ , real jack
[argues](http://fijiboardexiles.yuku.com/reply/24501/t/Dickhead-s-

outside investors by making the fight personal.
