![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

to an online video where Lebanese Hezbollah Leader, [Sayyid Hassan
Nasrallah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah), makes the
controversial claims that Iran does not have any
[Persian](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Persian_people)
civilisation but only an Islamic one, and that the Islamic Republic's founder
was of Arab ancestry.

_Aftab News_ , an Iran-based website
[says](http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdcivrazut1az32.cbct.html) [fa] the film was
composed of two parts and that it seems that Nasrallah's speech was delivered
last year. In another part of video, Nasrallah also praises the Iranian regime
for quelling protests after the [presidential election
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/iranian-election-2009/)in
June 2009. [A Facebook page ](https://www.facebook.com/pages/We-Iranians-hate-
Hassan-Nasrallah/143789822336016)has been launched for “anti-Nasrallah”
Iranians which has more than 9000 supporters (image above is from the Facebook
page).

_Raye Sabz Iran_ (Green Iran Vote) writes with irony [fa]:

> Mr. Nasrallah does the oil money that you get come from Arab coffers? You
> enjoy Iranian money but deny Iran's ancient culture… wake up

_Sight_ is also very angry with Nasrallah and [says
