November 1, 2009 was the one-year anniversary of the arrest of the Iranian
blogger, Hossein “Hoder” Derakhshan.

Cyrus Farivar, a US-based blogger and journalist, [reports
](http://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/?p=2703)that he has been in touch with
Derakhshan's brother Hamed, who informed him that:

> His parents recently had a meeting with the new district attorney, who
> allowed them to have dinner in Evin Prison with their son, Hossein
> Derakhshan, on Thursday, October 29, 2009. This confirms that Hossein is
> being held in Evin Prison, however the family does not know the next time
> they will be allowed to see him.

Iranian blogger Jooya, [writes](http://joooya.blogspot.com/2009/11/blog-
post_295.html) that Derakhshan is still in section No. 325 in the
Revolutionary Guards’ prison. According to human rights activists, Jooya adds,
he has has been in solitary confinement for about a year.

A group of Iranian bloggers decided to add “Free Hossein Derakhshan” to the
names of their blog for one week. Fanous Azad
[says](http://freelantern.com/p/?p=1116) (fa):

> I also added “free Hossein Derakhshan” to the name of my blog.

He adds:

> . . . when Hossein started accusing others I stopped reading his blog, but
> now I defend his rights without thinking who he is. . . . Hossein like other
> human beings should have right for freedom of thought and speech.
