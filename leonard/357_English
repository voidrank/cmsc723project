With uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world, the extra-
parliamentary opposition in Armenia is now seeking to replicate events in the
former Soviet republic, and not least because 1 March 2011 will mark the 3rd
anniversary of [post-presidential election
clashes](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/03/03/armenia-eight-dead-state-
of-emergency-declared/) which left 10 people dead. However, although there has
been some coverage in the local media, there has been next to none outside of
the country.

In part, some believe, this has been because few expect them to succeed. While
Azerbaijan has made the ‘watch list’ of several foreign media outlets, Armenia
and especially Georgia have not. _Footprints_ [offers its opinion as to
why](http://blog.hetq.am/2011/02/12/armenians-egyptians/).

> The Egyptians did it. They dispelled a regime that they knew to be

Opposition Rally, Liberty Square, Yerevan, Republic of Armenia © Onnik
Krikorian

_The Armenian Observer_ appears to be one of those discontent with the
situation in Armenia, but uninterested in the extra-parliamentary opposition's
renewed attempt to come to power. The blog [comments on the
speech](http://ditord.com/2011/02/19/neither-bread-nor-circuses-just-tired-
demands/) made by its leader, former president Levon Ter-Petrossian, at a
rally staged a week ago in the Armenian capital, Yerevan. _Reuters_ and _AFP_
estimated attendance at between 5-7,000 people while the local media put it at
10,000.

> “The plight of our people is no better than the plight of the peoples of
> those countries, and Armenia’s regime is no less dictatorial and hated than
> the regimes in those countries,” opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrosian,
> Armenia’s first President told the crowd before it marched through downtown
> Yerevan.
>
> […]
>
> However, I don’t think the crowd, which wasn’t there during HAK’s previous
> rally, came because they now suddenly started to trust the opposition force
> more. The opposition movement hasn’t done anything to earn that trust over
> the past couple of years.

Such a rally, including one scheduled to mark the 1 March anniversary, would
have happened regardless of Egypt and Tunisia. However, some analysts believe,
events in the Arab world at least proved encouraging. This even extends to
examining the [potential use of _Facebook_ and
_Twitter_](http://frontlineclub.com/blogs/onnikkrikorian/2011/02/armenia-an-
online-revolution-in-the-making.html) to enact regime change.

However, online activity remains incredibly low for now at least, with only
324 people both inside and outside of Armenia joining an unofficial _Facebook_
page, [Armenian revolution of reform : March 1,
2011](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Armenian-revolution-of-reform-
March-1-2011/189185421114440), for the next major demonstration at time of
writing. _The Armenian Observer_ [comments on the
situation](http://ditord.com/2011/02/14/armenian-opposition-talks-facebook/).

> Zurabian, who isn’t even registered in Facebook, told PanARMENIAN.Net
> reporter, that monitoring of the world’s largest social network carried out
> by the opposition force has revealed “great support” for the HAK among the
> population of Armenia. He than went on to conclude, that HAK supporters are
> educated people, who “have access to Internet technologies and social
> networks.”
>
> […]
>
> Currently there are 123,000 users registered from Armenia, which is
> something like 4% penetration in total population terms. So it is sheer
> utopianism to claim, as Zurabian did in his interview with PanArmenian.net,
> that social networks “provide great opportunities to overcome information
> blockade imposed by the Armenian authorities via total control of
> television.”

Few, however, take such claims regarding online support seriously, but if the
situation with _Facebook_ is bad, it is even worse on _Twitter_ , although
[@hpNYR](http://twitter.com/hpNYR), an opposition supporter in the United
States, has made an incredible effort to popularize the use of both _Facebook_
and _Twitter_ , including attempts to encourage use of a
[#1mar](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%231mar) hashtag, almost single-handedly.

Nevertheless, some believe, it might be too little too late.

Even so, _YouTube_ is at least being used by the pro-opposition _A1 Plus_ ,
formerly a television station [controversially forced off the
air](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/06/18/armenia-a1-plus-european-court-
ruling/) less than a year before the bitterly disputed presidential election
in 2003. A video uploaded today, for example, shows a minor confrontation
between police and opposition youth activists off Yerevan's Republic Square.

Whatever happens in Armenia next week, for now at least it appears that social
networks will not have played a significant role. Of course, some like
Armenian student and _Global Voices_ author Yelena Osipova argue that they
shouldn't necessarily always be [viewed as a total solution
anyway](http://lena-globalchaos.blogspot.com/2011/02/empire-social-networks-
revolution.html).

Meanwhile, as the extra-parliamentary opposition in Armenia prepares for 1
March, activists in neighboring Azerbaijan are looking to the 11th.
