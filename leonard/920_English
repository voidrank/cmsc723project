On December 11, the Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) was [shut
down](http://www.turkishforum.com.tr/en/content/2009/12/12/turkey-court-shuts-
down-dtp/) by the Constitutional Court of Turkey, unanimously. The charges
where in connection to a terrorist organization aka the PKK (Kurdistan Workers
Party) of Abdullah Öcalan, who is currently in jail.

_Ottoman's Posterous_ [says](http://ottoman.posterous.com/turkish-
constitutional-court-closes-pro-kurdi):

> The Constitutional Court on Friday banned the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society
> Party (DTP) on charges of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’
> Party (PKK). PKK has been labeled as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the
> US and the EU.

The 37 DTP members on the Turkish parliament and local parliamentarians were
also banned and – and so was the party leader, Ahmet Turk – who were all
[banned](http://www.turkishforum.com.tr/en/content/2009/12/11/turkish-top-
court-bans-pro-kurdish-party/) from politics for a five year term.

The DTP holds 21 of 500 seats at the Turkish Parliament and two of the
parliament members have been banned, leavind 19 with the hard decision to
abandon or hold on to their seats.

_The Kurdistan Commentary_
[explains](http://kurdistancommentary.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/dtp-closure-
step-backwards/):

> Ahmet Türk along with Aysel Tuğluk have been removed from Parliament, but
> not the other 19 DTP members. The choice for the remaining parliamentarians
> is to stay on and fight in Parliament, as Türk would like to see happen.
> Emine Ayna, DTP deputy chair, on the other hand, seems to favour a complete

_Eusko Blog_ [denounces](http://kaixo.blogspot.com/2009/12/el-contagioso-
recorte-de-libertades.html) the developments saying:

> Desde su fundación en 1963, el Constitucional ha ilegalizado veinticuatro
> partidos, entre ellos seis formaciones kurdas.  
>  Los 37 miembros del DTP, incluido su presidente Ahmet Türk, no podrán
> participar en ninguna actividad política durante cinco años. Además, Kilic
> ordenó que las cuestas bancarias del partido sean intervenidas.

Since it's foundation in 1963, the Constitutional has illegalized 24 political
parties, amongst them six Kurdish parties.  
The 37 DTP members, incluiding it's president Ahmet Turk, will not be able to
participate in any political activities for five years. Furthermore, Kilic
ordered an intervention on the party bank accounts.

On the provinces where Kurdish candidates were elected, new elections will
have to be called and the 19 members left of the DTP-now illegalized party-
already announced they'll abandon their seats.

Given the situation, the 19 remaining DTP parliamentarians have today, Monday,
decided to withdraw from Turkey's Parliament, according to online digital
specialist on Turkish facts _Turkish News._ It is still to be seen whether the
withdrawal is temporary or permanent. To establish itself in the chamber as a
group, they need 20 seats. Now, the DTP lacks one. But an independent deputy,
the socialist Ufuk Uras, has offered his seat to Kurdish deputies in order to
form a group.

The European Union already expressed their “concern” as [I

The Swedish EU presidency has assessed and indicated in a statement that,
while “strongly denounces violence and terrorism,” recalls that the
dissolution of political parties is “an exceptional measure that should be
used with most restraint.”

Some sources agree that, now, Turkey has even more problems to join the
European Union as this last move shows a complete lack of respect by the
democratic rights of it's national minorities and democracy itself.
