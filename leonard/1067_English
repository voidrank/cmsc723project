Last week, in Hammond, Louisiana, Beth Humphrey (who is white) and Terence
McKay (who is black) applied for a marriage license and [were
refused](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33332436/ns/us_news-race_and_ethnicity)
on the basis of their races. The justice of the peace, Keith Bardwell, claimed
that in his experience, “interracial marriages do not last long” and stated
that he was “doing it for the children.”

[ “Jim Crow laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws)” which required
separate facilities for black and white Americans ended in 1965, and [anti-
miscegenation laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws) that
forbade interracial marriage or sex ended in all states by 1967.

But racism still exists. Although much of the time it lies beneath the
surface, occasionally racism rears its ugly head in a way that is impossible
to miss; this story made headlines across the United States, prompting blog
posts from the local community and beyond.

In response to Bardwell's “defense” that he marries black couples all the
time, the anti-racist blog _Stuff White People Do_ expressed outrage,
[saying](http://stuffwhitepeopledo.blogspot.com/2009/10/still-ask-that-old-
camouflaging.html):

> Well, how thoroughly magnanimous of you, Justice Bardwell. Not to mention,
> intrusively paternalistic.
>
> Speaking of Bardwell's house, which I'm sure is just _overrun_ with joyous
> hordes of black and white children carousing together, he also had this to
> say:
>
> _I have piles and piles of black friends. They come to my home, I marry
> them, they use my bathroom. I treat them just like everyone else._
>
> Ah yes, black friends too, piles of them. Right there, in his bathroom!

A commenter on the blog, _Siditty_ (who also wrote her own post
[here](http://siditty.blogspot.com/2009/10/interracial-couple-denied-
marriage.html)), touched on the irony of Bardwell's anger:

> I always wonder about a man who comes from Louisiana, who has a strong
> history of race mixing, through the system of placage as well as creole
> culture, is now all the sudden concerned about the children. They weren't
> concerned in the 1700s, he shouldn't be now.

The blog _Racism Review_ countered Bardwell's “concern for the children” with
[evidence](http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2009/10/15/interracial-couple-
denied-marriage-license/) on children of interracial relationships:

> And, to further review the evidence, [children of interracial
> marriages](http://www.jstor.org/pss/352395) do not suffer in when compared
> to other children provided that they grow up in an environment that’s
> accepting of diversity and children of interracial marriages. If children of
> interracial marriages encounter racism (and other structural disadvantages),
> then they’re [more likely to experience
> stress](http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/93/11/1865), and health-
> related risks due to that increased stress, such as smoking and drinking.
> That’s a **_result_** of racism, and yet another reason to work to end
> racism. It should **_not_** be used – turning logic on its head – as a
> reason to perpetuate racism.

And _Black Girl in Maine_ touched on the “what about the kids?” question as
well, [noting the
experiences](http://blackgirlinmaine.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/what-about-the-
kids/) of her own biracial son:

> As for the kids, what about the kids? Yes, biracial kids sometimes catch
> flack from others but not always and I think among the youth today its
> almost considered cool to be biracial. As a buddy mentioned to me my son
> most certainly doesn’t suffer from a lack of friends male or female. I think
> the only time biracial kids have real issues is when they have no one to
> talk to them about their roots. I think when kids are connected to their
> historical roots as well as community, it creates a safe space for them.

In the United States, [anti-miscegenation
laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws#Anti-
miscegenation_Laws_enacted_in_the_Thirteen_Colonies_and_the_United_States) in
many states banned the marriage of white Americans to black Americans (and
Americans of some other ethnicities) in a number of states. While in some
states, these laws were repealed as early as 1780, in sixteen states the laws
were not repealed until a 1967 case, [Loving vs.
Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-
miscegenation_laws#Loving_v._Virginia), in which an interracial couple who had
married in Washington, D.C. were arrested in their own bedroom. Their legal
battle made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, at which point the laws
were overturned.

A number of bloggers touched on the legal aspects of the case. One blogger,
_Jay Says,_ [writes](http://jaysays.com/2009/10/louisiana-judge-refuses-to-
preside-over-interracial-marriage/):

> As a Justice of the Peace, he should be aware that interracial marriage is
> not illegal anymore – having been deemed unconstitutional 40 years ago. This
> particular instance hits home after this weekends National Equality March
> wherein I [briefly interviewed](http://vidly.com/aenC "Interview with the
> Newmans \(Our Marriage Was Once Illegal, Too\)") an straight, interracial
> couple, the Newmans (pictured) about why they are marching.
>
> Racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, religious intolerance and other biases
> can and do exist in our society, but they must not exist under the law. To
> allow an employee of the government who is paid by the taxes of the “free”
> people of the United States (or in this case, a state in the United States)
> to use his/her own personal beliefs to decide matters governed by civil law
> is abhorrent. If he doesn’t agree with interracial marriage, he needs to
> find a new job – perhaps Grand Master of the Ku Klux Klan?

Finally, one blogger has taken the opportunity to turn this incident into a
moment of learning. The blogger, whose blog is called _What Do I Know?_ , begs
readers to think about their own feelings on the subject:

> If you doubt that racism still lives inside us all, consider your reaction
> to the idea of marrying outside your race, particularly if you are white and
> the other race is black. Yeah, it's ok for other people, but wouldn't you
> find some good, rational reasons why your daughter would be making her life
> far more difficult when she brings home her black fiance? Be honest. Even if
> you said, “No problem” didn't you hesitate just a little? If you didn't
> you're unusual.

With Bardwell [now
saying](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&oi=news_result&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CA0QqQIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.usatoday.com%2Fondeadline%2F2009%2F10%2Flouisiana-

that he won't resign over the matter, one thing is certain: there is surely
more news to come.
