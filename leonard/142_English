Last week, the story of a robbery in the busy business area of Gadong, Brunei,
spread quickly on Twitter and Facebook.

Local celebrity blogger _ranoadidas_ posted on [his
blog](http://www.ranoadidas.com/) his concern about this bus robbery which is
unprecedented in Brunei:

> rumours that the victim was killed or murdered were not true. She was
> manhandled for sure and the culprit managed to walk away with the $$.
> According to a local source, the lady worker withdrew some substantial

Scene of the crime? From the twitpic page of @purply28

An earlier report stated that a few passengers on a bus might have caught a
glimpse of the ‘robbery’. Taken from _[Brunei
Times](http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2011/05/05/knifepoint-robbery-
gadong):_

> As the bus was still moving, he said he could not see the occupants inside

> witnessed the incident.

> “He was looking directly at the car. I don't know. He could've been one of

But even before the papers came out the next day, there was already rumours
that the robbery was staged. The fake robbery made the front page of one of
the local newspapers. Apparently, an employee tried to steal money from an
employer by faking a bus robbery. Here are some comments on Twitter:

> [@kisich](http://twitter.com/kisich/status/65967749649797120): okay… so, the
> robbery never happened.

> [@ranoadidas](http://twitter.com/ranoadidas/status/65968249904443392):
> [twitpic.com/4thu4v](http://twitpic.com/4thu4v) So the robbery was staged??

Even from the start the story did not really make sense. Why would anyone
withdraw BNF $20,000 and not have someone to accompany them? This is a tragic
story of how the ‘assaulted’ person tried to cheat her own employers but in
the end could not pull it off out of guilt.

In a fairy tale, there would be a happy ending, in this case the employers
could possible sympathise here and decide to help her. However, this is not a
fairy tale – in real life she will have to face the law.

This incident, regardless of its [false nature](http://www.bt.com.bn/news-
national/2011/05/07/fake-robbery-piques-peoples-curiosity), had given the
people of this country some cause for alarm that some people are not afraid to
resort to crime just to make a quick buck. It just shows that money, in this
case, can do more evil than good.
