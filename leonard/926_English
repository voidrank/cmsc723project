So you just made that list. Yes, the list with your New Year’s Resolutions.
Maybe you have written there that you want to exercise more often, and you
also want to help other people around the world, travel to a different country
and also meet people from other cultures. If the answer is `yes`, you will
love to learn more about the [Sahara Marathon
2010](http://www.saharamarathon.org) on February 22, 2010.

The Sahara Marathon is an international sport event to demonstrate solidarity
with the Saharawi people and this year celebrates its tenth anniversary.
Twenty different nationalities will face an enormous challenge in the Western
Sahara desert while helping the Saharawis in refugee camps.

This year the marathon will go to Dakla Camp and many Saharawi blogs are

sahara-2010.html), [_Sahara Deportes_](http://cazorla-
sahara.blogspot.com/2009/08/sahara-maraton-2010.html) and [_Blog de
Montaña_](http://blogdemontana.com/2009/12/07/sahara-marathon-2010-2/), write

Last year, _Kilometrosysueños_[ attended the Sahara Marathon
](http://kilometrosysuenos.blogspot.com/2009/03/sahara-marathon-la-
experiencia.html)and his inspirational experience to motivate you to take part
of it:

> _Recomiendo firmemente a todos los corredores esta prueba. Es maravillosa la
> experiencia de correr por el desierto, además hay distancias para todos: 5,
> 10, 21 y 42. No hay excusa!!!_
>
> _I strongly recommend this challenge to any runner. A race in the desert is
> a wonderful experience, besides there are distance options for all: 5, 10,
> 21 and 42 kms. You have no excuse!!!_

__ If you miss this, your second opportunity is the “[Sahara Bike
Race](http://saharabikerace.blogspot.com/)” that will take place next April,
with a blog promoting the event in multiple languages:
[Spanish,](http://saharabikerace.blogspot.com/2009_10_01_archive.html)
[French](http://saharabikerace.blogspot.com/2009/11/sahara-bike-race-
francais.html), [English](http://saharabikerace.blogspot.com/2009/11/sahara-
bike-race-in-english.html) and
[Italian](http://saharabikerace.blogspot.com/2009/11/sahara-bike-race-in-
italiano.html).

Many Saharawis have been refugees for more than 30 years, entirely dependent
on restricted aid and big efforts by their political leaders and facing the
indifference of the rest of the world. One third of them are children. Events
like the marathon and the bike race described above are intended to raise
funds to help them develop small projects but also to share with anyone a
unique and rich culture, but also the problems they face to survive as a
nation.
