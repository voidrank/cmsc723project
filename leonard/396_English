For the past few weeks, as Egyptians “cleaned” their country of a
dictatorship, Tahrir Square was full of people, full of joy, and as a result,
full of things to clean up. Though the activists at the heart of the square
took care of their [temporary
home](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/07/egypt-tahrir-squares-mini-
utopia/), there was nevertheless plenty to be done as the crowds thinned out.
Today, reports indicate that central Cairo is cleaner than ever, thanks to
loads of volunteers who chipped in.

As @CairoCityLimits [points
out](http://twitter.com/#!/cairocitylimits/status/36474004541800448) on
Twitter:

> Downtown Cairo: Cleanest city ever? Even the curbs have been freshly
> painted. #jan25 #tahrir

@JonJensen [adds](http://twitter.com/#!/jonjensen/status/36373137176268800):

> Massive cleanup effort underway in Tahrir right now – mostly by the Egyptian
> people. The first traffic starting to come through. #Egypt

Linking to a photograph (below), Arwa Mahmoud (@arwasm) shows the teamwork in
action:

> Fixing the pavements we broke after using them as stones to protect

Abdelrahman Hassan (@estr4ng3d) has a ground-level shot of the square to
share, and [this](http://twitter.com/#!/estr4ng3d/status/36407598932566016) to
say about it:

> I am not exaggerating when I say the asphalt in #tahrir is SQUEAKY CLEAN.
> Smells of disenfectant too! http://yfrog.com/h49dehcj

> It is literally a challenge to find more dust to sweep in #tahrir now.

And yet again, the famous Egyptian sense of humor emerges, with
@SharifKaddous's
[tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/sharifkouddous/status/36395319080001536):
