**A group of women in India have demonstrated that despite the existing gender
inequity and their low economic status, they can become a powerful resource to
tackle climate change and reduce the emissions that cause it.**

In India, the most vulnerable populations to climate change — impoverished
communities and women — are being affected first, and the most. For example,
[Oxfam India’s blog ](http://oxfamindia.wordpress.com/latest-from-the-
blog/)comments about the [devastating impact of drought on
farmers](http://oxfamindia.wordpress.com/human-impact/change-in-climate-
results-to-prolonged-droughts-in-anantpur/), and the direct effect on women
and children.

> In the last 12 years, almost 50 farmers committed suicide every year, one
> tenth of them being women farmers. (…) Increasing number of farmers started
> migrating to cities in search of food. And the situation became shocking
> when trafficking in women and children proliferated in the district.

**Gender as a Factor of Vulnerability to Climate Change**

It is estimated that [women produce over 50% of all food grown
worldwide](http://www.thp.org/system/files/Factsheet+on+Women+Farmers+and+Food+Security.pdf
). In [India, more than 84% of women are involved in agricultural
activities,](http://womensearthalliance.blogspot.com/) and as a result they
become the greatest victims of climate change’s impact. In addition, gender
inequality makes them disproportionately vulnerable to environmental
alterations. Blogger Pricilla Stuckey, PhD points out on the blog _This Lively
Earth_ [that women are unequally affected by climate
change](http://thislivelyearth.com/2009/10/15/women-farmin-and-climate-
change/):

> Discrimination against women also plays an enormous role in how women
> experience the effects of climate change. In India, for example, where women
> have seen their crop yields cut in half and the quality of grain diminish
> because of climate changes, women’s health is impaired from the double
> whammy of inferior crops and inequality.

Farmer Sita Debi is an example of this. “When there is no rain, we women have
to work really hard in the fields to try and grow crops. Our nutrition also
suffers because we are the last to eat at the family table. A lot of us are
anemic as a result,” she says in the
[video](http://findyourfeet.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/voices-of-rural-women-on-
climate-change/) filmed and posted on the blog _Find Your Feet_. Other women
farmers appear in the video explaining how badly climate change is affecting
their lives.

**When Women Fight Back**

Indian women don’t just sit around waiting to be hit by climate change. They,
also, fight back. As shown in the second half of the video, women are
developing innovative ways to adapt and help prevent global warming.

As reported in this [Inter Press Service
article](http://www.ipsnews.org/news.asp?idnews=46131):

> Agriculture accounts for at least [20 percent of Indian greenhouse gas
> emissions](http://www.envirovaluation.org/index.php/2009/11/02/greenhouse-
> gas-mitigation-issues-for-indian-agriculture ), mainly methane emission from
> paddy fields and cattle and nitrous oxides from fertilisers. According to
> the 2007 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
> Change (IPCC), India’s rainfall pattern will be changing disproportionately,
> with intense rain occurring over fewer days, leading directly to confusion
> in the agricultural scenario.

Another example of [women taking proactive steps to combat climate change is
taking place in the village of
Bidakanne](http://www.ipsnews.org/news.asp?idnews=46131), where women are
growing crops such as linseed, green and chick peas, wheat and other legumes
in between the rows of sunflowers, all without water and chemical inputs, such
as pesticides.

This type of agricultural activity is especially beneficial to the dalit or
broken women, who make up the lowest rung of India's caste system. Through
this system, women in the approximately 75 villages in the Medak district can
now form associations to sell their crops, as well as gather surplus produce
for poorer members. In addition, to using practices to reduce emissions and
harmful pollutants, this type of activity also helps reduce poverty.

The leadership and effort of these Indian women has not gone unnoticed within
the online community. Shiba Prosad Bhattacharyya comments on the site [_India
Together_](http://www.indiatogether.org/2009/mar/agr-ddsfood.htm)

> Thank you for your column that these women have been profiled here make a
> case for them being a role model to the world. (…)Food is a human right &
> not a corporate commodity for speculation.Mother nature does not operate on
> a boardroom profit.Corporate profit will mearly lead to more food crisis.
> Through you I am conveying my highest regards to these women leaders who
> have demonstrated no negative effects on the environment, public health &
> farming families that food production can be profitable, sustainable and
> feed all of us.
