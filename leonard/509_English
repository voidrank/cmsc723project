Last week, [heavy rains throughout
Morocco](http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6AT0I820101130) flooded
large swaths of the country, disrupting travel and telecommunications and
killing at least 30 people, including 24 who perished when their bus was swept
away by a flooding river in Bouznika, south of the capital, Rabat.

Citizen journalists have been surveying the scene and sharing their stories
about the heavy rains. On YouTube, _hamsemmieb_ shared a

“Arrived in El Jadida. According to this municipal employee, the road behind
me is now closed.”

Blogger _The Last of the Moroccans_ , an American living in Rabat, [describes
the rain](http://amiddins.blogspot.com/2010/11/rainy-season-arrives-or-shshta-
bzzef.html) from an outsider perspective:

> and it's true that rain in morocco is different from the rain i've
> experienced elsewhere, something i usually equate with the close proximity
> of the ocean. it doesn't matter if you have an umbrella and a rain coat on,
> you're still going to get soaked. usually it's like a swirling sideways
> mist, but lately it's turned into more of a swirling sideways monsoon. while
> i don't buy into the popular moroccan idea that it's cold just because it's
> raining (it's still 60 degrees here), there is an inescapable dampness.
> because moroccan houses are generally very open air with mostly tiled
> surfaces and don't have insulation or heating systems, the dampness seeps in
> until the only thing you can do is buy another umbrella and try to stay
> curled up under a blanket with mint tea as much as possible.
