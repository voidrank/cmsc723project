Afghanistan – the country's natural beauty – as well as its “ugly” side, the
poverty.

Nasim [writes](http://www.fekrat.org/2010/06/28/afghanistans-beauty/):

> Band-e Amir was to become Afghanistan’s first national park in the 1960s,

The blogger [says](http://www.fekrat.org/2010/05/20/grim-pice-of-
life/#respond):

> Many of the impoverished families living in the caves say they are too poor
> to live anywhere else even though the government insists that they are doing
> damage to an the area, near the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, which is a rare
> archaeological site. All are refugees who fled areas of fighting during the
> Taliban era, and have now returned from the other parts of Afghanistan. The
> cave dwellers are all Hazara, who are religiously and ethnically distinct
> and survivors of intense persecution by the Taliban.
