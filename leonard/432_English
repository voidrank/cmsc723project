Following mass protests in [Tunisia
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-uprising-201011/)and
[Egypt](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-protests-2011/),
a group Sudanese activists have chosen January 30, 2011 to be the beginning of
peaceful demonstrations to bring down [Omar al-Bashir
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir)and his government. Omar al-
Bashir came to power in 1989 following a bloodless military coup.

The Jan 30 Sudan campaign is calling on all sectors of Sudanese to get out
January 30th and demonstrate in the streets of Sudan's most populated cities.
[There are reports](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/30/sudan-protests-
demonstrators-idUSMCD03068020110130) of Sudanese police beat and arrested
students in downtown Khartoum.
