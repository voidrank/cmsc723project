For most of January, Qatar played the ideal host of the [Asian
Cup](http://www.the-afc.com/en/tournaments/men-a-youth/afc-asian-cup),
delighting fans with the perfect mix of football, fireworks and fun.

But the games ended on a [sour
note](http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ap-worldcup-qatar) Saturday
when thousands of fans were reportedly [denied

from Khalifa Stadium to watch the final game between Australia and Japan
(Japan won).

Jassim al-Rumaihi, operations director at the tournament, told the [Associated
Press](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/soccer/01/30/asian.cup.final.fans.ap/index.html#ixzz1CW8CCt93)
that the gates were closed five minutes after the match started for security
reasons.

But many fans said they showed up early for the match and still couldn't get
in.

Online, reports ranged from furious to heartbroken, some going as far as to
question Qatar's ability to host the World Cup more than a decade down the
road in 2022.

On popular social networking site [Qatar
Living](http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1594089#ixzz1CWhwZhyT), disappointed
ticket holders called on fans to complain to the Asian Football Confederation.

Commenter _TT.Boy_ said:

> We all need to highlight the same to Asian Football Confederation that what
> had happen to Foot Fans in Qatar and ask for refund.

Angry fans also got involved on _Facebook_ , forming a new group called [AFC
Bump Off](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_125702327499493) on Sunday
and attracting some 28 members within five hours of its creation.

The group's description reads, “We waited and waited. we got the tickets and
they didnt let us in.”

Not all reacted with indignation. Some quietly accepted last night's
disappointment and challenged Qatar to be better.

In the blogosphere, expat Sybil Knox of [Qatari
Adventures](http://qatariadventures.blogspot.com/2011/01/i-still-expect-
amazing.html), normally a cheerleader of all things Qatar, said she was too
disappointed to say much about Saturday's events. But she added, “I still
expect amazing,” borrowing the country's 2022 World Cup bid slogan.

She blogs:

> I'm like the mom whose child has done something wrong but can't talk about
> it because after all, it's my angelic child. The same is happening here. My
> home away from home, World Cup 2022 hosting country, Qatar, has disappointed
> me and it hurts. I'm a huge supporter and defender of most all when it comes

> Such a shame, for up until that moment, Qatar had executed a nearly perfect

> that would be me, Qatar has to have learned a good hard lesson here. You
> cannot fool the masses. Play the game right and let the chips fall where
> they may. You have eleven years to work this out, Qatar, so I still Expect
> Amazing. Don't let me down.
