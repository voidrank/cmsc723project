2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/cote-divoire-

The breaking news came in at 1 pm GMT on April 11, 2011: Laurent Gbagbo was
[arrested](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13039825) at his residence
in Cocody, with his wife, Simone, and close entourage. Five months after he
refused to hand the power to internationally recognised new president of Côte
d'Ivoire, Alassane Ouattara, the crisis in the country has now seemingly found
its epilogue.

**The sequence of events from April 10 to 11, 2011**

The French presidential office ([@Elysée](http://twitter.com/Elysee)) [fr]
announced via Twitter that France had accepted to take part in a new military
intervention in Côte d'Ivoire on April 10, 2011:

> [@Elysée](http://twitter.com/Elysee/status/57310961849221120#): En accord

> demandé à N [#Sarkozy](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Sarkozy "#Sarkozy") la
> poursuite de la participation française aux opérations ONUCI

@Elysée: In agreement with President Ouattara, the UN Secretary General [Ban
Ki Moon] asked N. Sarkozy to continue the French involvement in the UNOCI
[Côte d'Ivoire] operation

By making this statement, the Elysée justified [resuming](http://senegal-
actu.com/a-la-une/la-france-bombarde-la-residence-de-laurent-gbagbo-1976.html)
[fr] the military bombardments targeted at the Presidential Residence in
Cocody, Abidjan, where Laurent Gbagbo was bunkering down. This decision was
made in response to an
[attack](http://www.francesoir.fr/actualite/international/l-hotel-du-golf-qg-
ouattara-attaque-par-forces-gbagbo-90254.html) [fr] directed at the Golf
Hotel, the former headquarters of Ouattara's camp, by Gbagbo's Forces of
Defense and Security (FDS). The bombings began at 5 pm GMT (Abidjan Time).

Ebrié borough in the district of Cocody, Abidjan, showed

the media on YouTube on April 11, they were headed to Laurent Gbagbo's
residence:

At 11 am GMT, international French television channel France24 confirmed the

Armoured vehicles, backed by an helicopter, are approaching the residence of
the outgoing president Laurent Gbagbo, according to testimonies gathered by
AFP.

According to a Reuters [press
release](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-ivorycoast-france-
gbagbo-idUSTRE73A2XZ20110411) published two hours later, Laurent Gbagbo was
then arrested by French Special Forces, and handed to Ouattara's Republican
Forces. France24, referring to the latter wrote :

[BREAKING NEWS] Reuters reports that Laurent Gbagbo has been arrested by
French Special Forces

**Peace against all odds**

Following their arrestation, the Gbagbo couple was taken to the Hotel du Golf,
under the close
[escort](http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/monde/2011-04-11/gbagbo-ne-me-tuez-
pas-833878.php) of international forces. In the following[
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdcpsbymSyY) broadcasted by TCI, a TV
channel known to be close to Alassane Ouattara, Laurent Gbagbo is handed a
bulletproof vest to protect his life as he is being arrested:

Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognised president of Côte d'Ivoire
ordered his forces not to violate Laurent Gbagbo and wife Simone's human
rights.

TCI also posted another [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qca5nDIw4yc) in
which the former president Gbagbo calls for the end of fightings, and for the
return to peace:

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qca5nDIw4yc>

> Je souhaite qu'on arrête les armes, qu'on rentre dans la partie civile de la
> crise, et qu'on la conclue rapidement pour que le pays reprenne.

I want us to stop using weaponry, I want us to enter the civilian part of the
conflict, and end the crisis as fast as possible for the country to restart.

In an [address](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13043917) to the
Ivorians and to the international community on April 11, 2011, Alassane
Ouattara reaffirmed his will to enforce the rule of law, guarantee the
“physical integrity” of Laurent Gbagbo and his wife, and take the first steps
towards rendering justice.

This drive for peace is shared by many Ivorians, such as Diouf Mamy
([@mymaluydealbi](http://twitter.com/mymaluydealbi)) who wrote on Twitter:

@mymaluydealbi: After all that's happened, I hope Ouattara will be the
president of all the Ivorians without exception. Let peace be back in Côte
d'Ivoire. #CIV2010
