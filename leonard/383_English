On a Friday full of hope, freedom, resistance and perseverance, the Egyptian
people showed the world that even if there are “wannabe pharaohs” in Egypt
they are out there to uproot them. [For the past two
weeks](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-protests-2011/)
Egypt have inspired youths in many parts of the Middle East and Africa to
speak against injustice wherever it might be. Sudan is not an exception.

Sudanese online have been sending tweets of support and wishes to the Egyptian
people on the lower Nile basin. The basic message is: We congratulate you and
salute you for a wonderful inspiration and the power to empower us and many
people around the world.

Simsimt points out some of his concerns and thoughts hoping that revolution
came a little earlier:
