Syrian bloggers frequently decry travel writing about their country – often
it's too stereotypical, sometimes downright false. And for a country
considered long “isolated” at least from the United States, it can be
particularly frustrating to see such writing promoted as accurate. Therefore,
when popular Syrian blogger Sasa, who pens the blog _Syria News Wire_ spotted
[a recent piece in National
Geographic](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2009/11/syria/belt-text)
that he deemed “the best article on Syria in a decade,” he just had to [say
something](http://newsfromsyria.com/2009/10/22/the-best-article-on-syria-in-a-
decade/):

> This article is the real Syria. It is a checklist of points which Syrians
> know about their country, but which foreign journalists skip over, in the
> rush to confirm their own stereotypes.

Unsurprisingly, in a country often divided, not everyone agreed with Sasa's
interpretation of the article. Syrian Ambassador to the United States Imad
Moustapha (himself a
[blogger](http://imad_moustapha.blogs.com/imad_moustapha_the_blog/)) penned a
letter to the editor of National Geographic that was republished on the
[blog](http://joshualandis.com/blog/?p=4305) _Syria Comment_ , calling the
National Geographic article a “misrepresentation of the Syria that I belong
to.” Though _Syria Comment_ ‘s Joshua Landis didn't comment on the article
himself, his posting sparked over eighty
[comments](http://joshualandis.com/blog/?p=4305&cp=all#comments) and a lively
discussion.

Commenter Alex of _[Creative Syria](http://www.creativesyria.com/)_ was
critical of the National Geographic article, stating:

> I have no problem with most of what was written .. by I have an issue with
> the obvious impression the article leaves through its 90% emphasis on
> negativity … I don’t think an American reading it will hesitate to cancel
> his planned first vacation in Syria. Who wants to enjoy lunch in Bab Touma
> if poor brave Syrian people fighting for democracy are being tortured next
> door in Bab Touma?

Another commenter, Ghassan, liked the article:

> the articale is rational, reasonable, and accurate . my support to NG, and
> to the free press and speach which do not exist in syria.

Norman, also commenting on Landis's post, aptly remarked:

> It is interesting how Syria loving Syrians can disagree on the same article.

Other bloggers outside of Syria had strong feelings about the National
Geographic article as well. Evan Hill, who writes for group blog _The Majlis_
, felt that the article displayed Syria as behind the times,
[stating](http://www.themajlis.org/2009/10/24/when-the-ophthalmologist-
becomes-king):

> We're left with a Syria that seems stuck, economically and politically, in a
> mindset that's at least 40 decades old. The manager of a government-owned
> cotton plant, oblivious to or concealing any knowledge of the workplace
> dangers there, stares at Belt in seeming confusion when asked if he's ever
> made a profit. Academics and activists still fear the intelligence services
> created many years ago by Assad's father to destroy the opposition when his
> famed political wiliness wouldn't work.

After reading all of the criticism, _Syria News Wire_ [urged
readers](http://newsfromsyria.com/2009/10/27/not-the-best-article-on-syria-in-
a-decade/) to read both the original article _and_ Imad Moustapha's criticisms
before making up their minds.
