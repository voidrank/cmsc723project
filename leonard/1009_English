Nineteen year-old Jorge Steven Mercado
[dreamed](http://www.primerahora.com/Xstatic/primerahora/template/content.aspx?se=nota&id=344581)
about working in the fashion industry. He was also a
[volunteer](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iSIBFGvn3rHPW_Qd8id8-JHGbDrwD9C298300)
in organizations advocating for HIV prevention and gay rights. But, last week
his body was found dismembered, decapitated, and partially burned, in a rural
area in Guavate, Cayey, Puerto Rico. Activists from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
and Transgender (LGBT) community in Puerto Rico immediately described this
brutal slaying as a hate crime. [Not a single
crime](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iSIBFGvn3rHPW_Qd8id8-JHGbDrwD9C298300)
has been processed under the Puerto Rican Hate Crime Law since it was approved
in 2002. Penalties are higher if the Hate Crime Law is applied.

Days after the murder, 26 year-old Juan Martínez Matos confessed. According to
local news reports, Martínez Matos said he went looking for a prostitute in
the streets of Caguas, Puerto Rico, when Steven approached him. Martínez Matos
said he “didn't know” Steven Mercado was a man until they arrived at his
apartment in an another town (the victim was allegedly dressed as a woman).
Gay activists Ada Conde and Pedro Julio Serrano [have publicly
stated](http://www.primerahora.com/Xstatic/primerahora/template/content.aspx?se=nota&id=344961)
that the sector where Steven Mercado was picked up is mostly frequented by
transsexual and transvestite men. Martínez Matos said he killed Steven in
“self defense” after they got into a fight. He then mutilated his body, and
left it in a desolated area miles away from his house. Martínez Matos also
stated he hated homosexuals because he had been raped when he was in jail for
committing domestic violence. Gay activists were outraged when the police
officer in charge of the investigation said: “Someone like that, who does
those kind of things, and goes out in public, knows full well that this might
happen to him.” They [have demanded the officer's immediate
removal](http://www.primerahora.com/Xstatic/primerahora/template/content.aspx?se=nota&id=344524)
from the case. Martínez Matos has been charged with murder and bail was set at
$4 million USD.

Since Puerto Rico is a United States territory, federal laws apply. Two Puerto
Rican United States Congress Members from New York have asked for this crime
to be prosecuted under new federal hate crimes laws. The [Federal
Investigations Bureau (FBI) is
monitoring](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iSIBFGvn3rHPW_Qd8id8-JHGbDrwD9C298300)
the investigation. In the 1980s the serial murderer Ángel Colón Maldonado,
known as the “Angel of the Bachelors”, killed 27 homosexuals in the Island.
Recently, gay actvists have also warned about another murder against a gay man
in San Juan, the country's capital.

Bloggers have reacted to this terrible crime. The human rights actvists and
spokesperson of the LGBT organization Puerto Rico para Tod@s (Puerto Rico for
Everyone), [Pedro Julio Serrano](http://pedrojulioserrano.com/) [ES],
condemned the religious leaders’ and the politicians’ silence:

Ante uno de los asesinatos más horrendos en la historia del País, el silencio
ensordecedor de los líderes políticos y religiosos es una vergüenza de marca
mayor. Les tiene que dar vergüenza de no hacer expresiones de solidaridad
hacia la familia y allegados de Jorge Steven. Les tiene que dar vergüenza de
no solidarizarse con las comunidades lésbica, gay, bisexual y transgénero
(LGBT) ante el odio que produjo este crimen. Les tiene que dar vergüenza de no
condenar la homofobia en este caso y las acciones prejuiciadas del agente
investigador. Les tiene que dar vergüenza que han olvidado su obligación
constitucional de instrumentar la igualdad para todos los seres humanos.

> We are before one of the most horrendous murders committed in the history of

> even more shameful. They should feel embarrassed for not expressing their

In [Saadaya](http://saadaya.blogspot.com/) [ES], Hiram, a Puerto Rican blogger
from Chicago, lamented the long history of homophobia in Puerto Rico:

Pero el crimen no es lo único chocante. Nada sucede en un vacío: todo tiene
raíces, todo tiene causas y efectos, y Puerto Rico como sociedad ha nutrido
por generaciones el odio hacia los gays, lo han nutrido los líderes cristianos
desde los púlpitos, los padres al criar a sus hijos, las autoridades
policíacas y jurídicas […] y los políticos que tienen un convenio ilícito con
las iglesias que no es muy bien disimulado. En una isla así, que quepa en el
pecho de un muchacho matar a otro por ser gay del modo tan mórbido en que lo
hizo no debería ser chocante: es algo que Puerto Rico llevaba tiempo
cocinando.

> But the crime is not the only shocking thing. Nothing happens in a vacuum:
> Everything has its roots, its cause and effect. Puerto Rico as a society has
> promoted hatred against the gay community to generations of people.
> Christian leaders have promoted hatred from their pulpits. Parents have
> instilled hatred in their children. Law and order agencies…and politicians
> have an illicit agreement with the church that they do not conceal very
> well. It should not shock us that in an Island like this, a man can murder
> another man for being gay in such a horrendous way. This hatred has been
> brewing in Puerto Rico for a long time.
