The ongoing protests in Egypt have ‘electrified’ netziens in the Maldives. The
fascination with the current phenomenon in Egypt transcends all geographical
borders but in the Maldives there is a special significance as it brings back
flashbacks of pro-democracy protests held only a few years ago to bring
democracy to the Indian Ocean island nation.

Hilath [urges](http://www.hilath.com/?p=9195) President Nasheed of Maldives to
say some words of encouragement to Egyptian protesters:

This is Egyptian President Mubarak’s 30th year in power and Maldivians are
drawing parallels between Mubarak’s rule and the 30-year-old dictatorship in
Maldives that ended in 2008.

show solidarity with the protesters in Egypt.
