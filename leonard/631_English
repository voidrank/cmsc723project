The use of national media as an instrument of propaganda has been fairly well
documented in Tunisia. Tunisian citizen media have been well adept at tracking
the numerous instances of fabrication of information and censorship of
publications critical of the government. The latest evidence of media
manipulation was identified by Tunisian bloggers on August 20 when newspaper
_Le Temps_ [fr] and its Arabic version _Assabah_ published reports on
fundation Zeitouna sending of humanitarian food supply to the victims of the
floods in Pakistan. To illustrate the report and the involvement of
businessman and the president son-in-law Sakhr El Matri in the initiative, Le
Temps published a [photo showing Sakhr El Matri inspecting the materials

into the aircraft:

The community blog _Nawaat_ describes features on the images[ that suggest
that they have been doctored](http://nawaat.org/portail/2010/08/21/tunisie-au-
groupe-assabah-apres-les-interviews-bidons-les-photos-truquees/)[fr]:

It does not take an expert to observe at first glance that that the photo has
been “retouched” and that somehow the president's son-in-law “landed” in the
image thanks to an unrefined copy-paste job. Beside the fact that the light
exposure and the direction of the shadows do not match, one can also see that
Sakhr El Matri ‘s sleeve hides part of the elbow of the man in the blue shirt
even though the man is in the foreground!

_Nawaat_ finds a bit of humour noting that at least, the Arabic version of the
newspaper did a slightly better job at doctoring the photos:

> Assabah, la version arabe du quotidien, a publié la même photo mais avec un

> voit que le bras du mécène passe derrière le coude de l’homme en chemise
> bleue, comme le voudraient les lois de l’optique

Assabah, the arabic version of the newspaper, also published the same photo
with a slightly better photoshopping effort albeit still quite detectable.
When one zooms in on the contentious area, one can see that the right arm is
now seen behind the elbow of the man with the blue shirt as the laws of optic
would dictate

Same image in Assabah with a different modification via Nawaat.org

The fact that the doctored images were outed online clearly reached the
editors of the newspapers because the [photos were promptly
replaced](http://www.assabah.com.tn/article.php?ID_art=39417) soon after in
the online version. A [video posted on
facebook](http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1396510602075&ref=mf) did
show Sakhr El Matri inspecting a humanitarian airplane but it is unclear
whether the video was shot before or after the photos were published. It is
all the more astonishing that doctored photos would be utilized in two
national newspapers so liberally if it seems that original images were
available using the video footage. One must also note that Sakhr El Matri is
fully involved in the management of both newspapers. Tunisian bloggers have
also wondered in what capacity Sakhr El Matri, a civilian, was allowed to
access the runway of what looks like a military base airport. Tunisian twitter
user _Lilopatra_ also wonders [what kind of plane the Zeitouna foundation
used](http://twitter.com/Liliopatra/status/21841270780) to transport the
humanitarian food supply to Pakistan. She
[adds](http://twitter.com/Liliopatra/status/21878484422):

> Si on se met dans la position du protecteur à chaque fois,cela retardera la
> maturité & la capacité de prise de décision du

If we always try to consider issues from the perspectives of the top person,
it will considerably slow down the maturity process and decision making
ability of citizens #Tunisia

Unfortunately, these doctored photos are fairly symptomatic of other
manufactured information in Tunisia. For instance in 2009, the news agency
[Tunis Afrique Press
](http://www.tap.info.tn/fr/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1)(TAP)
reported that Tunisia was ranked [32 out of 165 countries on the political
stability index generated by The
](http://nawaat.org/portail/2009/04/12/stabilite-politique-et-democratie-en-
tunisie-la-tap-ne-risque-pas-la-mise-a-l%E2%80%99index/)[Economist
Intelligence Unit ](http://www.eiu.com/PublicDefault.aspx#). The only problem
is that the [index actually shows that Tunisia was ranked
134th,](http://www.nawaat.org/portail/wp-
content/uploads/2009/04/instability_index.jpg) a hundred slots below the one
stated in the introduction of the article.

**UPDATE:** It is important to clarify, as a reader points out, that the list
ranks the most instable countries first. Therefore it is correct to assert
that Tunisia is the 32nd most politically stable nation. The use of the
reversed ranking instead of the ranking as stated by EIU is explained by
_Nawaat_ as [follows](http://nawaat.org/portail/2009/04/12/stabilite-
politique-et-democratie-en-tunisie-la-tap-ne-risque-pas-la-mise-
a-l%E2%80%99index/):

> Bien que…renversante, cette « interprétation » de l’index est surement due à
> « un souci de clarté » de la part de la TAP. On les comprend. Parler «
> d’instabilité » dans le pays de « _la sécurité et de la stabilité_ », selon
> la formule officielle, risque de… « déstabiliser » le lecteur

While it [the ranking] is…”upside down”, the presentation of the index in such
manner by TAP is most certainly for the “sake of clarity” and understandably
so. After all, to speak of instability in the country known for, as often
stated by officials, its _security and stability_ could… “destabilize” the
reader

Snapshot of The EIU Political Stability Index via Nawaat.org

In 2007, the same agency was [guilty of overstating a
report](http://nawaat.org/portail/2007/09/28/les-mensonges-
via-l%E2%80%99international-herald-tribune-la-tap-prise-de-remords/) [fr] that
claimed that the International Herald Tribune wrote a [full page report on the
educational system of Tunisia](http://nawaat.org/images/TAP-Tunisie-
Education_croped-small.jpg), including two articles about the government
striving provide the best educational system for its citizens and the
importance of education for the development of the nation. They omitted an
important part though, they forgot to mention that there was never such
articles in the IHT news section but rather [a full commercial page in the
paid advertisement section](http://nawaat.org/images/IHT-Advertising-
Calendar.jpg) [fr].  
The original TAP articles about the political stability index and the IHT
report are not accessible to the public online anymore.  
Tunisia is often praised for its robust export-driven liberal economy but
slammed for its authoritarian political system. The [Economist's 2008
democracy index
](http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy%20Index%202008.pdf)classified Tunisia
as an authoritarian regime with a ranking of 141 out of 167 studied countries.
