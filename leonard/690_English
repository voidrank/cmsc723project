When a minister warned that Malaysia could suffer a [‘Greek
tragedy’](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/5/27/nation/20100527171008&sec=nation)
if subsidies are not cut, the nation suddenly woke up to the inevitable but
politically unpopular move once again. As where the government stands, it is
no longer an issue of should or should not, but how to implement subsidy cut
gradually and retain critical social safety net for the poor. There are few
key perspectives to consider.

As expected, it is never strictly an economic issue. Government has been
seeking broad public buy-in before making any concrete move. According to
_[Free Malaysia Today](http://freemalaysiatoday.com/fmt-
english/politics/barisan-nasional/6039-malaysia-subsidy-cuts-hobbled-by-
politics)_ :

> Malaysia's government is unlikely to start unwinding its costly subsidy
> regime this year ahead of key state polls and risks losing further
> credibility with investors if a decision is deferred. […] PM Najib has
> already delayed a planned fuel hike in May due to fears of upsetting voters,
> especially poorer majority Malays who form a critical votebank.

For Eastern Malaysia states where poverty rate is still a serious concern,
citizens there have long relied on subsidies and they may not share the
sentiments from the government. Like
_[SabahKini](http://www.sabahkini.net/v1/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4148:cut-
in-subsidies-affects-malaysian&catid=35:berita-sabah&Itemid=27) _argued:

> We deserve more privileges and benefits, and cannot be deprived by the
> government on their part being unable to provide us all this. […] The
> government must find ways to provide subsidies to help the people. They are
> merely creating higher poverty rate, especially in Sabah where the people

There are also parties who argue that we need to look at the big picture, as
[hidden subsidies](http://www.bakrimusa.com/archives/tackling-subsidies-and-
their-myriad-manifestations) and wasteful spending also contribute to huge
deficit. Bakri Musa said:

> If Idris Jala (Minister in PM's Department) had been diligent and fearless
> in analyzing the twin problems of ballooning deficit and increasing
> spending, he would begin with the obvious and massive petroleum subsidy,
> then flush out the hidden subsidies represented by non-competitive bids of
> government contracts, and then get rid those money-losing GLCs (government-
> linked companies).

Anil Netto also [concurred ](http://anilnetto.com/accountability/will-subsidy-
cuts-hurt-the-poor/)by saying:

> Many Malaysians blame the country’s financial woes on the government, with
> the general response being if the government really wants to save money from
> subsidies, it should first plug ‘leakages’ in government expenditure and
> curb rampant corruption. Billions have been poured into unproductive
> government projects with little to show.

There are also calls to conduct a more comprehensive study to ascertain the
purpose of subsidy cut and how to use the available funding eventually.
