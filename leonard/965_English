Monday marked the 21st anniversary of the [1988
earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Spitak_earthquake) which
devastated many areas in northern Armenia leaving around 25,000 dead and many
more homeless. Yet, despite a huge inflow of money from international donors
for reconstruction, conditions still remain harsh more than two decades on
with thousands still living in _domiks_ — temporary accommodation such as
simple shacks or even metal containers.

Precise numbers for the number of families in Armenia's second largest city of
Gyumri still living in such a situation are still unknown, but it is believed
to be around 4-7,000. But while the government has promised to provide them
with apartments by the end of the year, bloggers continue to focus on the
problems faced by many. _Peaches and Pomegranates_ [visited Gyumri a day
before the
anniversary](http://peachesandpomegranates.blogspot.com/2009/12/travels-in-
gyumri.html).

Writing on the _Birthright Armenia_ blog, one ethnic Armenian volunteer from
the Diaspora recounts his time in the city working with a journalist
organization as well as the local Caritas Armenia NGO, and [one encounter in
particular](http://birthrightarmenia.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/dig-yes-dig-dig-
deep-dig-often/).

> I can tell you that if you dig, you will find out what a “domik” is, what it
> looks like, what it smells like, which legally blind man lives alone in a
> particular one in the “Barracks” district; you will find out that besides
> the legally blind man, 7,500 families still live in domiks; you will
> understand the true nature of hospitality; you will realize where the
> mistrust of government stems from; […] you will know why your host
> grandfather’s eyes glaze over whenever he talks about anything circa 1988;
> […] you will uncover that nearly all marshrutka’s are privately owned by the
> mayor and drivers pay 2,000 AMD a day to rent them; you will realize that
> the youth are bored and disenchanted; […] you will realize why people want
> to leave…and why they want to stay.
>
> Of course, digging around in Gyumri requires sifting through a lot of
> rubble. In most cases it’s psychological rubble. I met my host uncle Moso
> the very first night I was there. […] Oh, and he was deaf… which was an
> interesting surprise for my first night there […]. He taught me Armenian
> sign language (I don’t know if he was kidding or not, but the sign for
> “Gyumri” is apparently to beat your chest with your fists…like a silverback
> gorilla, while the sign for Yerevan kind of looks like playing the world’s
> tiniest violin). […] He could read lips and he could even sound a few words,
> having lost his hearing when he was three years old. That is…21 years ago.
> That is…in 1988. […] I forget how I brought it up, but he started telling me
> about his experience in the earthquake. Apparently, he was standing outside
> his school when buildings began collapsing. His father had rushed over to
> him and snatched him up, just as his own school began crumbling in front of
> his eyes. He didn’t hear after that.

Another foreign visitor to Gyumri for the anniversary was Ashley Corinne
Killough, a Fullbright scholar in Armenia. She [posts an account and an audio
slideshow](http://ashleykillough.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/norik/) (above) of
another encounter made through Caritas Armenia on her blog.

> More than two decades after the 1988 earthquake that killed one out of every
> 12 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Gyumri, Armenia, the
> city is still recovering. Unemployment numbers are dire, and many
> dilapidated, unusable buildings remain standing.
>
> An estimated 4,000-5,000 families still live without proper homes. They wait
> for housing while living in the same “domiks,” or Soviet cargo containers,
> that they inhabited 20 years ago. There are others who have apartments, but
> the conditions are barely livable.
