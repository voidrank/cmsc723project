Two hundred women and men have marched through the streets of several cities
of Brazil on June's Saturdays to put an end to exploitation of the female body
as an object and the culpability of women for being sexually assaulted.

Holding banners, posters and catch up slogans, they rocked São Paulo on June
4, Recife on June 11, Belo Horizonte and Brasília, the Federal Capital,
[received the feminists](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=153297578071623
"Página do Facebook da Marcha") last Saturday, June 18, and made society think
a little about gender oppression. In this article we share the [best moments

The initiative was inspired by the “SlutWalk”, that began in April in Canada,
after a policeman declared that women should stop dressing themselves like
sluts to avoid being victims of rape. The statement caused an outrage and a
huge movement on the Internet, which started in early April with the protest
in Toronto and has happened in more than 20 North American and Australian
cities until now.

On June 4 it also occurred in Los Angeles, Chicago, Edmonton, Estocolmo,
Amsterdam, Edinburg, and the first one in Brazil was in São Paulo.

The calls to march were made on Facebook. In Sao Paulo, though 6000 people
confirmed they were going to attend the event on the social network, the real
number of participants was around 300. Concerning Recife's March, Jesus Toic,
one of the creators of the event on Facebook,
[wrote](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=178417792216778&id=1541348800):

> A Marcha das Vadias Recife reuniu cerca de 400 pessoas interessadas em

> advinda de um imaginário doentio, foram rechaçadas com inteligência lúdica.

The Recife SlutWalk gathered around 400 people who wanted to express their
outrage against the historic male control over women's bodies. Phrases that
blame the women, and not the rapists, arising from a diseased imagination,
were repulsed with playful intelligence.

The comments of the comedian Rafinha Bastos were remembered by the protesters,
who ended up the walk in front of his Comedian Club and put banners on the
doors. Rafinha, from the Brazilian CQC, created a controversy when he said in
[_Rolling Stone_ magazine](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/06/08/brazil-
jokes-about-rape-and-the-limit-of-humor/<br ></a> "Matéria sobre o caso") that
ugly women should be thankful for being raped.

Another member from CQC was remembered. The actor and journalist Marcelo Tas
was booed for [attacking Lola
Aronovich](http://escrevalolaescreva.blogspot.com/2011/06/liberdade-relativa-
marcelo-tas-quer-me.html "Lola escreve sobre o processo"), one of the most
famous feminist bloggers of the country, when she published a [text where she
criticizes a report made in his program
](http://escrevalolaescreva.blogspot.com/2011/06/cqc-anti-amamentacao-vai-pra-
pqp.html) about the #mamaço (#breastfeeding) in São Paulo.

Tas and his colleagues satirized the attitude where mothers were breastfeeding
in public saying they should cover their breasts. The women were protesting
because a mother was prevented from breastfeeding in a bank.

In reaction to the first Brazilian SlutWalk, [Lola
Aronovich](http://escrevalolaescreva.blogspot.com/2011/06/viva-marcha-das-
vadias-ja-reacao-ela.html "Post da Lola sobre a Marcha"), said:

> (…) a sexualidade de uma mulher é dela, não é pública, não é do homem ou da
> sociedade, e que deve ser respeitada. Respeitada de todas as formas, desde
> não ser julgada (sim, queremos a mesma liberdade sexual a que os homens têm
> direito) a não ser invadida, seja através de estupros, seja através de
> “passar a mão” (que, assim como as grosserias verbais na rua, funcionam como
> uma espécie de terrorismo sexual).

(…) a woman's sexuality is hers, it's not public, it does not belong to men or
society, and must be respected. Respected in all ways, from not being judged
(yes, we want the same sexual freedom that men have) to not being invaded
through rapes or a “hand over” (that like much verbal rudeness on the streets
works like sexual terrorism).

The Federal Deputy from the Workers Party, Erika Kokay(@ErikaKokay), on June
11, [called](http://twitter.com/#%21/erikakokay/status/79939701703835648):

> Chega de sermos culpadas pela violencia que sofremos! Estarei na marcha das
> vadias.Vamos todas!
> [#marchadasvadias](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23marchadasvadias
> "#marchadasvadias")

Enough of being blamed for the violence we suffer! I will be on the SlutWalk.
Let's go, all of us!

The reasons of the Brazilians are the same as other women around the world:
respect. The blogger [Lia Padilha wrote](http://liapadilha-
vemvoarcomigo.blogspot.com/2011/06/marcha-das-vadias.html "Post da Lia") about
it:

> Nós brasileiras nos deparamos cotidianamente com o controle da sexualidade
> feminina. A concepção conservadora-religiosa é repressora e dita que a
> mulher deve esconder o corpo ante a sociedade e se resguardar para o marido.
> Por outro lado, a voracidade do capitalismo tem interesse pelo corpo
> feminino descoberto, e nesse caso expõe, banaliza, explora e agride a
> sexualidade feminina.

We brazilians are faced everyday with the control of female sexuality. The
religious-conservative conception is repressive and tells women that they
should hide their bodies from society and save themselves for their husbands.
On other hand, the voracity of capitalism has interest in the naked female
body all, and in this case, exposes, trivializes and violates female sexuality
and attacks.
