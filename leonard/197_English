Imagine how it is to live in Pakistan; a place where a day without any suicide
bombing or drone attack can make the news, where citizens have to deal with
emotions such as shock, rage, discomfort and a deep sense of helplessness on a
daily basis.

On a recent morning, the first tweet that caught my eye, was one by a
Pakistani columnist, Fasi Zaka
(@[fasi_zaka](http://twitter.com/#!/fasi_zaka)):

> @[fasi_zaka](http://twitter.com/#!/fasi_zaka/status/61313254848335873): The

One of Zaka's Twitter followers’ [replied to this
tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/Suprah_/status/61318956941717504):

On an average day many Pakistanis re-tweet or share via Facebook news of
suicide bombers, NATO drone attacks and the Taliban’s retaliation to them.

Ali Chishti at _Pakistanpal's blog_
[writes](http://pakistanpal.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/whose-drone-is-it-

Acceptance of these drone attacks in Pakistan has made the country's people an
unwilling ally. However, regardless of whatever one-sided alliance is created,
the people will still suffer, either as a result of the drone attacks or from
attacks by the Tehrik-i-Taliban.

_Kathy Gannon_ , a former American correspondent of Afghan-Pakistani affairs
during 1986-2005, [states something
similar](http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20110417/NEWS04/304179897/-1/NEWS09)
in her article published in _The Journal Gazette_ :

> Pakistan is frustrated by stepped up drone attacks and accusations it is
> weak against Islamic militants despite nearly 3,000 dead soldiers, a five-
> year war in its tribal areas and dozens of arrests of suspected al-Qaida
> operatives or affiliates.

In [my own blog](http://jehannaseem.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/the-people-vs-
the-taliban-vs-nato-by-jehan-naseem/) I have shared opinions of people I have
come across, describing how lives in their cities have radically changed out
of fear and frustrations.

_Fahd Dar_ , a student from Lahore, says:

> Life's going on but it's definitely not the same. People have restricted
> their outings. Although the famous hang out spots still remain crowded, but
> the fear of the unknown is still there. With scanning apparatuses installed
> at almost every corner of the city, even at educational institutes, it
> naturally gives you a feeling of hesitancy and vulnerability. Lahore doesn't
> feel that safe now, to eat your favorite eatables late at night, or watch a
> nifty play at Al-Hamra. Still, our hopes are high, things would get better.

_Haris Hameed_ , a manager at an advertising agency in Islamabad:

> A drive from one end of Islamabad to the other meant you had two options.
> Take the scenic route running parallel to the majestic Margalla Hills or the
> one that ran through the heart of the business district, fondly dubbed Blue
> Area. However, that was then. Now, when planning out your route, only one
> thing is considered: ‘Which route has the least amount of security check
> posts?’ […]
>
> Understanding that these security measures resembling an obstacle course for
> mice in a science experiment are a necessity in recent turbulent times, the
> people of Islamabad have taken everything in their stride. There is always
> remorse and empathy for victims when there is a bomb blast or terror attack
> in the city, but with a day or two of caution, the local venture back into
> their routines. I believe the common thread between the people of the
> capital (regardless of what section of society they belong to), is that they
> keep on living. To cower at home in fear and stop leading normal lives is
> exactly what the terrorists’ want us to do. If we were to do that, it would
> mean that the terrorists would be successful in their goals, and that they
> have won. We certainly can’t let that happen. So we live, one day at a time.

We can only hope that soon things will normalize in Pakistan, but hope seems
to be far away.
