Anger over the police killing of a 29-year old man in Tottenham, north London
on August 4, 2011 fueled by racial tension, has spiralled into [rioting and
looting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_London_riots) by youth across
London and other cities in the United Kingdom.

On Twitter, the hashtag
[#LondonRiots](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23LondonRiots) is constantly
being updated with new comments, links, rumours and eye-witness reports.
Showing hope that the rioting will soon come to an end, the
[#RiotCleanup](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23riotcleanup) hashtag is used
by citizens organizing volunteers to help clean streets and repair damage.

The violence began on Saturday, August 6 after a protest outside Tottenham
police station demanding “justice” for the victim, [Mark
Duggan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mark_Duggan). According to the
[BBC's timeline](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14436499), the protest began
peacefully but ended with cars, buildings, and a double-decker bus on fire.

This time-lapse video by [Prokopi Constantinou](http://www.itdrewitself.com)
shows the blazing fires and rising smoke over north London on the early
morning of August 7 (music by [Dogtanion](http://www.facebook.com/dogtanion)):

Journalist [KC Wildmoon](http://wildmoon.us/) has been keeping a [Storyful
liveblog of events](http://storyful.com/stories/1000006194) as the riots
spread across London on Sunday and Monday to Enfield, Dalston, and Brixton.

This map by radio futurologist [James Cridland ](http://james.cridland.net)

Citizens have doing their part to track the violence in videos, photos, and
maps.

On Monday morning, Global Voices blogger [Janet
Gunter](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/janet-gunter/) set up [ “Brixton
Incident Map”](http://brixton811.crowdmap.com/) using Ushahidi's
[Crowdmap.com](http://crowdmap.com) tool to track riot reports in her south
west London neighborhood.

At the end of the day, there were 22 reports of looting on the website and
only one of “good news” when [a local bakery handed out free
cupcakes](http://brixton811.crowdmap.com/reports/view/17). Among the videos
posted on the site is one by [@subedited](http://twitter.com/subedited) and
[@emmareyn](http://twitter.com/emmareyn) that shows the looting of a T-Mobile
store on Brixton Road (the main commercial street) from start to finish. Next
door at H&M, looters exit with arms full of clothes.

In east London neighborhood Bethnal Green, a video shows youth smashing
bottles and store front windows, as outnumbered police move towards them with
raised shields.

Citizen news website [Blottr.com](http://www.blottr.com/) has crowd-sourced
reports and photos from across the UK.

**But why?**

As the destruction continues, public patience with rioters is running very
low.

Echoing many comments on Twitter, @OxfordGirl says:

> [@OxfordGirl:](https://twitter.com/#!/oxfordgirl/status/100681021858643968)
> There is no rioting, no protesting, no demands or slogans, this is just
> looting and destroying London. Heaven help us all #LondonRiots

Songwriter and MC, [Casey Rain](https://twitter.com/#!/caseyrain) set up a
[Tumblr blog about Birmingham riots](http://birminghamriots2011.tumblr.com/)
with photos and updates. On Monday he shared [a personal
comment](http://birminghamriots2011.tumblr.com/post/8662259640/a-few-words)
urging people to have some compassion for rioters:

> It’s easy to dismiss the rioters as “scum with nothing better to do” but
> there are much deeper problems here. As a young, male, ethnic minority in
> the inner city myself, chances are, I probably know some of these people. I
> can relate to the feelings of helplessness. I’ve been fortunate enough to be
> successful as a musician myself and been able to create my own positive
> future, but these kids rioting don’t see themselves having a future at all.
> They have been failed by society as a whole, they’ve been failed by the
> government cutting arts funding and closing youth centres, unemployment is
> rife to the point where even the ones desperately trying to seek work simply
> can’t find it, and the boiling point to all this (Mark Duggan events) is a
> situation that is VERY REAL.
