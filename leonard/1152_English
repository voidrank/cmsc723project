On August 24, two young hikers, a 19 year-old American and a 21 years-old
Chinese man [were found
lost](http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/909601.html) on [Stampede
Trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stampede_Trail), near Fairbanks, Alaska.
Troopers who discovered them said they wore only urban clothes and carried
little food. It's not the first time unprepared travelers have been found in
this wild and inhospitable area.

Like others before them, they had set out to see the “Magic Bus”, one of the
two main characters of a best-selling book, [_Into the
Wild_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild) from 1996. It was later
[adapted to screenplay
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_%28film%29)by Sean Penn who also
directed the movie in 2007.

The book, by [Jon Krakauer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer), tells
the true story of Christopher “Alexander Supertramp” McCandless, a college
graduate who left behind friends and family for an odyssey through American
roads that would lead to his fateful goal: Alaska. He was found dead in 1992
in a converted public bus that used to be a hunters’ shelter.

There are still questions about [the actual cause of
death](http://www.tifilms.com/wild/call_debunked.htm), ranging from starvation
to poisoning or injury that lends mystery to the story.

According to _The Star_ newspaper in Canada, [about 100
people](http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/267203) from around the world
follow in McCandless’ footsteps on pilgrimages every year. He is considered a
symbol of freedom and man's return to nature.

**Pilgrimages to the bus**

Adventure traveler and blogger Dan of _The road chose me_ ,
[describes](http://dangrec.com/?p=647) the difficulties he had journeying all
the way to the spot where McCandless died.

> I met two cool Austrian characters, Thomas and (roll the ‘R’) Roland on the
> Dalton Highway and it took all of 10 seconds to convince them to join me on
> a trip to ‘The Bus’. We were able to drive about 12.5 miles down Stampede
> Road before we had to leave the vehicles behind and continue on foot. The
> first hour and a half of hiking the next morning saw us travel on a really
> good quad trail, through some small swamps, through a couple of shin-deep
> river crossings and spat us out at the edge of the Teklinika River.

They wandered upstream, and found a place to cross the river. “I was more than
a bit scared when it reached mid-thigh in depth and began to really push
hard,” writes Dan. Eventually they reached “Fairbanks Bus 142″:

> When bus 142 appeared on the side of the trail, seemingly out of thin air I
> was quite startled […] but somehow wasn’t ready to be there yet. I paused on
> the edge of the clearing for a moment, then again in the doorway, trying to
> take everything in. Even though I’d never been there before, it was very
> familiar – from the description in the book, the movie and also from the
> pictures I’ve seen online.
>
> I thought The Magic Bus would be a quiet, sad place to spend time – I was
> quite surprised to find the opposite was the case.

**Desecration of the bus**

It seems some visitors don't respect this ‘mausoleum’. Fairbanks, Alaska
blogger _Ed Plumb_ describes this in his blog _The Edventures_. About his
second visit to the bus, he
[wrote](http://edplumb.blogspot.com/search/label/Fairbanks%20Bus%20142):

> So we arrived at the bus to find it in complete disarray. A handful of
> windows had been bashed in, broken glass was scattered about, and most of
> the items in the bus had been overturned. Garbage was strewn all around the
> perimiter and into the adjacent stand of spruce trees.

Of course, the bus doesn't only attract fearless adventurers or spoilers.

Unfortunately, these numerous expeditions can be a strain on the local
community when costly rescue missions are involved. Consequently, there has
been talk among Alaskans of one day [moving the “Magic
Bus”](http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/267203) to somewhere that would be
easier for visitors to access.
