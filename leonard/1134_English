Several parts of Metro Manila and nearby provinces are still flooded today
even if [Tropical Storm
‘Ondoy’](http://210.185.184.53/ndccWeb/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=164&Itemid=221)
(International name: Ketsana) has already left the country. [Almost
200](http://www.gmanews.tv/story/173312/ondoy-death-toll-may-have-
exceeded-200-still-climbing) were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced
when the storm hit the country’s capital last Saturday.

The heavy rainfall triggered the [worst
flooding](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/27/philippines-worst-
flooding-in-40-years/) in the country in recent memory. The storm even [dumped
more
rains](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20090927-227186/Ondoy-
dumped-more-rains-than-Katrina) than Hurricane Katrina:

> FACT: Hurricane Katrina rainfall =380mm in Louisiana. Typhoon Ondoy rainfall
> = 410mm in Manila, Philippines.

[Social media sites](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/28/philippines-
helping-flood-victims-through-social-media/) were maximized to inform rescuers
about the location of flood victims. [Typhoon Ondoy Situation
Map](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dExYV0pxcWlLLWVOUmQzeDUwWUdObVE6MA..)
was created to compile information about the needs of the flood victims.
Google has created a [special page](http://www.google.com/landing/typhoon-
ondoy.html) to gather donations. [Ondoy Relief
Efforts](http://ph.search.yahoo.com/searchpad/shared/1bdc4096ace28294307e6c9d2972b275)
has a comprehensive list of contact details of relief agencies, donation drop-
off centers, and government emergency response teams.

Citizen videos were uploaded on cyberspace which captured horrible scenes of
loss brought by the flooding. Below is a video by Youtube user didipusrex

> My mother was able to take a video clip of the floodwaters of Typhoon Ondoy

> the next morning.

This video shows a passenger who was trapped in a car while a strong
floodwater was rampaging outside a Manila hospital

Marikina City, located east of Manila, was heavily devastated by the floods

Pedestrians and even motorists in Paranaque City, south of Manila, use
styrofoam to cross a flooded street

Cars are swept away by strong flood currents

Bulacan province, north of Manila, was also [severely
affected](http://bryantonpost.blogspot.com/2009/09/like-rest-of-provinces-in-
luzon-bulacan.html) by the storm

_Techpinas_ [praises a radio station](http://www.techpinas.com/2009/09/heroes-
of-philippine-fm-radio-jam-883s.html) for devoting its program to update
listeners about the storm. Many of its listeners were flood victims who relied
on their cell phone radio for relief updates:

> In the midst of uncertainty and suffering brought about by Ondoy and the
> lack of electricity in most parts of Mega Manila, DJ Gang, DJ Lambert and DJ
> Steph selflessly gave their time and effort into making sure that cellphone
> owners – especially those stuck in disaster stricken areas, whose only
> access to news was their dying cellphones’ FM radio app – were kept updated
> on the status of relief operations and were somehow kept alive by Jam 88.3's
> display of resilient and pro-active hope. They practically turned the
> usually indifferent FM radio scene into a venue for disaster relief info
> dissemination and volunteer coordination.

Texting was used to advise flood victims on how to survive

> What was truly heartening is the public's involvement in Jam's efforts.
> There were those who called the station to give updates on the traffic
> situation across the metro. Doctors texted to give tips to those staying on
> the roofs of their flood-engulfed houses on how to avoid hypothermia, while
> a former red cross volunteer shared the procedure on how to prepare an oral
> rehydration solution
