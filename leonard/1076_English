October 1, was the UN-designated _**International Day of Older persons** _and
the theme this year was ___“Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the
International Year of Older Persons: Towards a Society for All Ages”_. In his
[message for the
day](http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2009/unissgsm140.html),
the UN Secretary-General [Ban Ki-moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-
moon) said:

> _Over the past decade, we intensified our efforts to build a “society for
> all ages” and to promote international commitment to the United Nations
> Principles for Older Persons. The Principles are founded on the need to
> build an inclusive society that emphasizes participation, self-fulfilment,
> independence, care and dignity for all. To transform them into deeds, we
> have campaigned for policies that will enable older persons to live in an
> environment that enhances their capabilities, fosters their independence,
> and provides them with adequate support and care as they age._
>
> _The motto “towards a society for all ages” was adopted in 1999 and
> reaffirmed at the Second World Assembly on Ageing, held in Madrid in 2002.
> It emphasizes the need to treat older persons as both agents and
> beneficiaries of development. […]  
>  _
>
> _The international community is also devoting increasing attention to the
> human rights of older persons. We must put an end to age discrimination,
> abuse, neglect and violence against older persons. I urge states to put the

For us in India, this seems like a perfect time to stop and take stock of the
role played by ICTs in the lives of our senior citizens.

According to the [Norwegian Board of
Technology](http://www.teknologiradet.no/ICT%20for%20elderly%20people_wNGky.pdf.file)
[pdf],

> _Information and communication technology (ICT) characterises today’s
> society. Side by side with technological development we will within the next
> few years be faced with a greatly increasing number of elderly people. What
> are the concrete challenges connected with elderly people and information
> and communication technology? How can positive possibilities be exploited
> and negative effects avoided?_

With a rise in life expectancy, India has today joined the ranks of countries
where demographic ageing has become an important issue. At the time of the
[2001
census](http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/broad.aspx),
there were 77mn people in the 60+yrs category, which was about 7.5% of the
total population. The 2008 estimate is around 86mn. India today has the 2nd
largest population of senior citizens. According to the UN, by 2050 about 20%
of India's population is likely to be over 60yrs.

With the rapid growth of the elderly segment, the key question facing policy-
makers (and the society in general) is how to ensure an active, healthy,
independent, life of dignity for the elderly and help improve their quality of
life. Recognizing the need for a national policy in this area, the Indian
Government launched the [National Policy on Older
Persons](http://www.socialjustice.nic.in/npopcomplete.pdf) in 1999, which
sought to address principal areas of concern such as financial security,
healthcare, shelter, education, welfare, protection of life and property etc.,
and promote the concept of [_active
ageing_](http://www.who.int/ageing/active_ageing/en/index.html) among the
older population. The policy also acknowledges the role of NGOs and civil
society in complementing the efforts of the government in this direction.

In their paper ‘[ _Technology Interventions for Elderly
People_](www.scienceandsociety-dst.org/TIEPage.pdf)‘ [pdf], authors _VC Goyal_
and _Usha Dixit_ mention that

> _The use of technology to support independent living and promote
> independence of older persons is mentioned in recent Government policy
> documents (e.g. National Policy on Older Persons). There are other
> Government (and some non-government) initiatives which, although not
> specifically targeted at technological interventions for older persons,
> could contribute towards supporting comfortable and dignified living for
> this section of the society. There exists a vast scope of technology
> interventions for welfare of elderly people in the country so that the
> technologies are accessible, affordable and adaptable to the specific needs.
> Technological interventions can greatly help in achieving the objectives of
> the NPOP by providing vital inputs and capabilities._

So where are we currently as far as ICT for senior citizens/ older persons is
concerned?

One of the main concerns cited often as a point against ICT has been the
perception of inertia and/or technophobia among the elderly. _Andy Oram_ at
_O'Reilly Radar_ , while [_commenting on a
point_](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/09/computerization-in-
nilekanis-i.html#technophobia) from Nandan Nilekani's book – [Imagining India:
The Idea of a Renewed Nation](http://imaginingindia.com/), that “ **
_technophobia should not be assumed_** “, says that:

> _A lot of technologists glibly anticipate that computers and Internet access
> will be rejected by some group of people who are implicitly labeled ignorant
> or clueless: racial minorities, poor people, the elderly (“how can you get
> my grandmother to use this?”), etc. In every case, the key to adoption turns
> out to be access and sometimes the availability of useful applications. When
> presented with the opportunity, these populations always prove eager to take
> advantage…The problem is not the people, but other factors such as
> availability, cost, and usefulness._

_Lesley D. Biswas_ at [The WIP](http://thewip.net/) writes about how in a lot
of cases, the ‘Silver Surfers’ are embracing the Internet to cope with a
lonely future. She
[says](http://www.thewip.net/contributors/2009/04/silver_surfers_senior_citizens.html):

> _For seniors who have been culturally conditioned to believe that their
> children will be at their sides in their winter years, living alone has come

> absence of family members at this critical time makes it all the more

It is therefore, no surprise that one of the key areas where currently ICT has
made inroads into the lives of senior citizens is ****

**Helping them cope with loneliness/battling exclusion** :- Land-lines/Mobile
telephony, messaging, E-mails and chat are some of the ICT applications that
senior citizens are warming up/ have warmed up to in order to remain
connected. Of late, social networking among elderly has also become a
possibility with the launch of _**[Verdurez](http://www.verdurez.com/)**_ – A
social networking site, designed for the elderly.

The site, described as the “Facebook for those 55yrs and above”, caters to the
needs of senior citizens to battle loneliness, connect, network, get news and
information pertaining to health etc., play games/ work on puzzles, and share
life online with a group of like-minded people in their age bracket. The site
has over 4000 registered users.

_Seema_ at _[WATBlog.com](http://www.watblog.com/)_ is however, [a bit
cautious](http://www.watblog.com/2009/06/09/pachpan-like-bachpan-on-social-
networking-site-for-oldies-verdurezcom/) in her appreciation of the idea:

> _Social networking site for senior citizen sounds good concept, but i’m more
> concerned about the how many Indians of this age use computers and Internet
> and for how long they will use networking sites. Promoters should promote it
> well and associate some NGOs and oldage homes with them. We need our elder

> people online through such social networking sites and don’t feel alone._

Her concern appears to be justified. For, according to _Mrutyunjay Mishra_ of
[_juxtconsult.com_](http://www.juxtconsult.com/index.asp) , senior citizens

> _…account for only 0.8% of the internet users in India, hence in our
> estimate around 0.32 million regular internet users are Senior Citizens (of
> 38miilion total regular internet users)._

Nevertheless, despite the low reach through Internet, we have many other Web-
based initiatives designed for the elderly, such as:

**Providing them a feeling of safety** : For example, a security portal
[_Hamari Suraksha_ ](http://www.hamarisuraksha.com/)has been launched by the
Mumbai police to register senior citizens and ensure their safety in the face
of rising crimes against them.

**Education and Healthcare:** We are gradually becoming more familiar with
initiatives(and the need for more integrated/better delivery of these kinds of
initiatives) for the elderly in the areas of training &/or e-learning,
e-health etc.

Senior citizens, especially those in the urban, up-market cluster, are
themselves are getting gradually drawn into the E-culture. Thus we see that
today many senior citizens are using the Internet to do their banking, paying
utility bills, booking e-tickets etc., which gives them the flexibility of not
having to leave the confines of their home yet do things on their own without
having to to depend on others to do these tasks for them.

While in the case of the Internet, penetration, connectivity and accessibility
are limiting factors, the mobile telephony market is much more broad-based.
According to _Rajesh Jain_ of
_[Emergic](http://emergic.org/2008/12/16/2009-india-mobility-trends/)_ ,

> _India is now growing at about 10 million new mobile users every month, and
> that pace of growth will continue. We will probably be close to 450 million
> subscribers by end of 2009_

Mobile based ICT initiatives thus hold the promise of greater reach in the
current scenario. Helplines, SMS based services etc., (for ex: the The
[Chandigarh based NGO
_**DadaDadi**_](http://www.comminit.com/en/node/299629/307) is using short
messaging service (SMS), telephonic helpline and other technologies (web-
based) in an effort to ensure the safety of elderly people living alone in the
city) are increasingly being used to help the elderly stay connected with
convenience. In _The India Post_ , _Jorawer Singh_ [writes about the 24X7
helpline](http://www.theindiapost.com/2009/10/01/senior-citizens-helpline-
launched-on-day-for-elderly/) launched in Chandigarh on October 1:

> _On the International day for the Elderly or the Senior Citizens’ Day as we
> call it, the Older Adults of the tricity gets a much awaited 24 X 7
> helpline. The helpline number is 9888 9888 47. The helpline, to be monitored
> by a local NGO DadaDadi.org, will provide information and assistance related
> to varied needs of the senior citizens, from sending electricians, plumbers
> to legal aid and support in fighting for their cause._

The possibilities are many and India is only just waking up to the potential
of harnessing the power of the ICTs to empower it's senior citizens to lead a
fuller, active and independent life with dignity. However, in doing so, we
need to take care of various challenges such as accessibility, design
elements, human factors etc.

For example, mobile phones often have complicated navigation steps and and the
interface is not suitable for use by the elderly. (Though, on the other hand,
a mobile designed and marketed specifically for the older persons may not be
exciting to the target consumer). Also, in our enthusiasm to provide
[gerontechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontechnology) solutions, we
should not dehumanize the process to the extent that the older persons feel
more isolated and disengaged.

Furthermore, we should keep in mind that the elderly are not a homogeneous
group and therefore one solution will not work for all. Thus there are
specific challenges to be overcome in trying to integrate various sub-
categories of older persons (ex: the need for ‘last mile solutions – to reach
the distant potential users of ICT’ to integrate the ‘below poverty line”
and/or rural elderly.

Furthermore, as _Rozina Parmar_ points out in her paper “[ICT for
elderly](u3aindia.org/patrika/ICT-for-Elderly.pdf%20)” [pdf]

> _Clearly we need a new model of innovation in ICT for ageing, one which is
> needs oriented and puts users at the center of the ICT systems. New aspects
> are needed across all aspects of older people's lives, whether in private
> sphere, public sphere or at work._

Ten years have passed since the National Policy of Older Persons was launched
and according to a [Seniors World Chronicle
report](http://www.seniorsworldchronicle.com/2009/10/india-ten-years-after-it-
was-launched.html), _Mr. Mathew Cherian_ , Chief Executive, [HelpAge
India](http://www.helpageindia.org/), has opined that the implementation has
been very poor. On his part, [_Mr.
Wasnik_](http://www.socialjustice.nic.in/cabinetminister.html), Head of the
National Council for Older Persons, has admitted that the task ahead is
massive but that a lot can be achieved with the involvement of civil society.
