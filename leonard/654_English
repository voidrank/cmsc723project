While there have been significant increases in agricultural productivity in
Asia and Latin America over the last 30 years, productivity in Africa has
[stagnated](http://blogs.uct.ac.za/blog/amandla/2010/05/21/enhancing-food-
security-in-africa-through-science-technology-and-innovation.-unctad) and [1
in 3](http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/) people in sub-Saharan Africa
still go chronically hungry. Many solutions have been proposed to help combat
hunger in Africa, but one in particular remains controversial:
[biotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology).

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that
[1.02 billion
people](http://www.fao.org/hunger/hunger_home/hunger_at_glance/en/) do not
have enough to eat in the world; [more than a
fourth](http://www.fao.org/hunger/faqs-on-hunger/en/#c41476) of these people
live in sub-Saharan Africa. The reasons for the region's food insecurity range
from economic crisis to an expanding population. In a Penn State University
blog on biotechnology, Dr. Terry Etherton in the United States
[elaborates](http://blogs.das.psu.edu/tetherton/2010/04/14/food-security-for-
a-billion-poor/) on these challenges:

> In sub-Saharan Africa, where more “ultrapoor” live, developing technologies
> to boost productivity is especially difficult because of greater threats
> from pests and diseases, poorer soil, and drought. In addition, Africa’s R&D
> [research and development] establishments are small compared to those of
> South Asia—half had fewer than 100 scientists in 2000. Compared to Latin
> America, Africa has less than half the rural roads per hectare, 1/40th the
> capital per farmer, and 1/50th the rural electricity supply per worker.
> Despite some success with maize [corn], cassava, and some horticultural
> crops, few African countries have experienced a Green Revolution.

On a global scale, Africa uses the least fertilizers, pesticides and hybrid or
[genetically modified
(GM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food) seeds of any
continent, although many experts
[suggest](http://www.eoearth.org/article/Opportunities_and_risks_of_genetically_modified_crops_in_Africa#Food_security)
that [genetically modified organisms
(GMOs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism) could help
ensure food security by increasing crop yields, producing hardier crop
varieties, enhancing a crop's nutritional value, and improving storability.
Others claim there are numerous risks associated with adopting GMOs in Africa.

Bloggers following the debate alternately wonder whether Africa is being
[bullied](http://seedtoplate.org/article-1183126361.html) into accepting
biotechnology, or whether Africans are [being needlessly scared
off](http://www.gmoafrica.org/2008/04/journalist-counsels-africa-on-gmos.html)
by anti-GMO activists.

Journalist Gregory Simpkins in Washington D.C
[outlines](http://africarising2010.blogspot.com/2009/11/behind-scenes-debate-
on-gm-foods.html) the debate in his personal blog _Africa Rising 2010_ :

> Those who don’t trust what they see as Big Science and capitalists, believe
> GM agricultural products are “Frankenfood.” Those alarmed by the rise in
> both malnutrition and food prices see a crisis that may be alleviated by
> using science to jump-start the Green Revolution in Africa. The problem is
> that there is not enough evidence that these products are either
> unjustifiably dangerous or completely safe. Africa’s brain drain doesn’t
> make this situation any easier since many of the scientists who could ensure
> that their homelands don’t use unsafe agricultural products or take
> advantage of existing technology to prevent starvation live and work in
> other countries.

Resistance to GMOs is high. Currently South Africa is the only country on the
continent to have approved GM seeds for planting.

Reporter Philip Brasher traveled to South Africa and Kenya to chronicle the
role of biotechnology in [an article
series](http://pulitzergateway.org/2009/11/can-biotechnology-save-africa/) for
the DesMoines Register sponsored by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.
He says [more than 70 percent](http://pulitzergateway.org/2010/05/biotech-in-
africa-in-south-africa-the-welcome-mat-is-out/) of South Africa’s latest corn
crop, the country’s largest in decades, is biotech. While some African
countries have allowed imports of this GM corn as food aid, others, such as
Zimbabwe have
[rejected](http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100607/FOREIGN/706069892/1135/commentary)
these products despite the need.

The U.S. government and American biotech companies say Africans should drop
their opposition to GM crops in order to help feed the continent. The [Bill
and Melinda Gates
Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation)
has also jumped on board, by helping to set up the [Alliance for a Green
Revolution in Africa (AGRA)](http://www.agra-alliance.org/) in 2006, and more
recently by funding research to engineer more drought-resistant corn. Some
agriculture experts in Africa are also [calling on
Africans](http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/10485) to embrace
agricultural technologies to boost food production. The blog _GMO Africa_ also
[believes](http://www.gmoafrica.org/2008/04/journalist-counsels-africa-on-
gmos.html) Africans should be able to take advantage of biotech:

> “An open-door policy to new technologies, especially in the field of
> agriculture, is what Africa needs. When activists intimidate Africa, through
> fear, into not exploring potential benefits of GM foods, the continent
> suffers. They stymie a rational debate about whether GM foods have any
> relevance to Africa.”

However, many bloggers are weary of widely introducing GMOs in a continent
comprised mostly of small farms. An article on the progressive pan-African
website _Pambazuka News_ by Nidhi Tandon
[outlines](http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/64921) the concerns:

> The risks to Africa of fully adopting industrial agriculture in general and
> GM seeds in particular include:
>
> \- transferring its food and farming decisions to global corporations
>
> \- losing ecological and agricultural diversity as genetically modified crop
> varieties spread, and driving small- and medium-scale family farmers off
> their land because they cannot afford the expensive inputs, including
> genetically modified seeds, that industrial agriculture demands.”

In South Africa itself, reactions to GMOs also remain
[mixed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/24/environment-sa-bloggers-
sound-off-on-gmo-foods/). On the blog of a South African family that
cultivates [“heirloom”](http://livingseeds.co.za/what-are-heirlooms) and open
pollinated seeds, called _Livingseeds_ , Sean Freeman
[says](http://livingseeds.co.za/gmo/the-silent-bomb-and-monsantos-
mistake#utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed) there isn't enough
evidence to support GMOs even though they were “forced onto the South African
public”:

> ‘All the evidence’ shows that GMO is the best thing since sliced bread,
> however the problem we have is that all of the evidence is slanted and
> prepared by a) GMO houses b) Scientists that have their research grants
> supplied by GMO houses or c) Universities that are sponsored by GMO houses.
> All impartial evidence is wiped sorry forced sorry explained away and
> serious anecdotal evidence is discredited as not having any scientifically
> credible weight, as it’s not…… scientific. However here is some anecdotal
> evidence that is pretty indisputable.

Freeman links to a [news
story](http://www.noseweek.co.za/article.php?current_article=2017) about
widespread crop failures in South Africa in 2008/9 due to “a breeding error”
in genetically engineered seeds sold by the global corporation
[Monsanto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto). An [online
petition](http://www.activist.co.za/campaigns/2009/investigategm.php)
initiated by the [African Center for
Biosafety](http://www.biosafetyafrica.net/index.html/) says Monsanto
compensated commercial farmers who lost their yield but banned them from
speaking to the media, and made no mention of whether they compensated
resource poor farmers who were given the seed and lost their yield as well.

Most agricultural experts do agree that GMOs alone won't solve Africa's hunger
issues. Other solutions suggested by bloggers include [organic
farming](http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/05/11/the-advantages-of-organic-
farming-in-africa/), growing your [own food](http://livingseeds.co.za/gmo/the-
silent-bomb-and-monsantos-
mistake#utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed), and promoting
[social change](http://www.foodpolitics.com/2008/03/are-cultural-elites-
responsible-for-famine-in-africa/). Whatever the solutions, on _Africa Rising
2010_ Simpkins [argues](http://africarising2010.blogspot.com/2009/11/behind-
scenes-debate-on-gm-foods.html) we need to openly consider all options,
including biotechology:

> The behind-the-scenes debate over GM foods needs to be brought into the open
> and examined carefully. Promoting products that may be dangerous is
> unacceptable. However, in the face of growing hunger in Africa, we owe it to
> the hungry to explore every possibility for meeting their needs while they
> still live.
