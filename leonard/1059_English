The issue of adoption in Japan is a dynamic one. There is a social mentality
which places massive importance on blood relations, and a legal system which
largely reinforces it; on the other hand, Japanese citizens are increasingly
choosing lifestyles incongruent to traditionally accepted norms (visible in
trends in marriage age, family size, adoption as a viable choice in family
planning). The actual volume of adoptions that go through in Japan are indeed
low: in 2008, citizens from the [United States adopted just
35](http://adoption.state.gov/country/japan.html) [en] Japanese citizens.
Beyond the numbers, however, are a number of important issues and serious
problems being faced by families in and outside of Japan, as well as the
private agencies and government groups facilitating the children living in a
situation that is generally looked down upon domestically.

At a high level, there are national policy issues. The Child Welfare law has
seen little change in post-war Japan, and modern concerns with agencies
turning a substantial profit from organizing adoptions have been growing
steadily. The law states that adoption agencies may only charge what they need
to cover costs; costs are identified as falling into ten categories, such as
transportation, consultation charges, and the like. Problems arise with the
relatively ubiquitous “donation” system many of these agencies utilize.
Naturally, a non-profit group is bound to seek donations to provide the
capital needed to keep the organization financially stable, however this is a
system easily abused.

An international adoption blogger [notes a past
case](http://international.adoptionblogs.com/weblogs/adoption-in-japan):

> In one instance, a Tokyo adoption agency that featured “free adoption
> services” asked one of their clients–a Japanese couple living in the
> Netherlands–for a 5.5 million yen donation in advance. Believing the fee to
> be too high, the couple declined to pay. However, the agency then told them
> it would stop looking for candidate children, according to the ministry.

This is a cloudy area to monitor, as discerning legitimate donations from
profit-seeking extortion can in many cases be a difficult judgment to make.

In the last three years, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare has
attempted to encourage municipal and prefectural governments to tighten the
local regulation of independent agencies. Many orphanages and foster care
organizations are quite small and independent, making local authorities the
necessary leader in stimulating change. That said, some challenge that the
entire adoption process would benefit from being government-regulated; that
agencies should require licensing and be made to adhere to federally-applied
screenings. Reasons for seeking federal responsibility stem from concerns of
the end result of international adoption, namely human rights violations and
exploitation such as child pornography.

Hiroto Suzuki, a professor at Chuo University is [quoted on this
matter](http://international.adoptionblogs.com/weblogs/adoption-in-japan):

> “The existing simple registration system should be replaced by a system
> under which adoption agencies are not allowed to operate without government
> screening or a license. The current framework is inadequate for bringing the
> real state of affairs to light.”

Turning the focus to adoptions entirely within Japan, there are a number of
trends which are observable.

For very practical purposes, that is to say, not for emotional satisfaction,
there are actually a very large number of people in Japan who want to adopt,
though not necessarily young children. When elderly people are nearing death
and are setting their final affairs in order, naturally the passage of their
estate is among the more time-critical concerns. In order to avoid the taxes
placed on direct parent-to-child inheritances, they adopt a grandchild, and
will their estate to the adopted grandchild.

Beyond the tax-dodging, the continuation of family names is important to many
people, and often, couples with no male heir will adopt an adult male, and
will their possessions to him in exchange for the name change. Domestic
statistics are not well-tracked, but it is likely that adult adoptions for the
purpose of preserving the family name make up the lion's share of legal
adoptions conducted in Japan.

This latter trend points us to one of the critical issues facing abandoned and
orphaned children in Japan: the importance and strict nature of family records
has established a mindset through which adopting a child is an option looked
down upon by many. [The family koseki](http://www.crnjapan.com/japan-
law/koseki.html) (戸籍), official documentation recording family progression
(marriage, birth, death, etc.) over the years remains influential to this day,
and while with many younger individuals it has no influence on forging new
relationships, there are still cases in which business/employment
opportunities, marriages, and other such situations are negatively impacted by
an abnormality in the family records, which could include adoption.
Furthermore, older relatives may vocally disapprove of the adoption of a
child, creating a distinct point of tension.

To get a better look at the complexity and intra-familial issues that can
arise along with or as a result of seeking an adoption, let's [take a look at
a case](http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1330917878)
blogged about recently by sakaidesu45, relating his personal situation.

Since I was very young, I was told by my great-grandfather that I was the heir
to the family business. (According to my grandmother's stories, he would even
say this at company meetings). With my great-grandfather's passing, I thought
the discussion of my inheriting anything was gone as well. That is, until my
grandmother asked me to carry on her family name.  
For this, there are two reasons which I can come up with.  
1\. My grandmother has a younger brother (my great uncle), and he has two
children. My grandmother bears a great deal of ill will towards this younger
brother's wife and kids, and has already made him write his will so that his
wife and children cannot receive the family inheritance.  
2\. She also is resentful of my father, whom she will under no circumstances
approve of (He is actually my step-father).  
As a result of all this, my grandmother does not wish to pass the inheritance
on to my parents, nor to my great-uncle, and by adopting me, it seems she
feels that she can protect and safely pass on all the things she succeeded
from her father.

There are presently a number of conflicting forces at play: a disapproval of
adoption from those valuing past norms, yet many of these people are the ones
adopting heirs into their family near the end of their lives. This negative
viewpoint also clashes with the many younger families who are seeking to
adopt, rejecting past ideals and placing the importance on their present
family. Legally, progress has been slow. In the late 1980s, the law was
changed to allow adopted children to remove their biological family name from
their _koseki_ , which makes concealing an adoption easier on their end…
pragmatically, this is a useful change, but it reflects clearly the remaining
national discomfort with such familial “abnormalities.”

On a support thread created by someone dealing with issues of realizing their
adopted status later in life, user alice0614 [relates her own
experiences](http://qanda.rakuten.ne.jp/qa5276198.html).

I also was adopted when I was less than a year old, and I first learned this
three years ago, when I received a copy of my family registry. Because I had a
very close relationship with my parents, I spent a week or so worrying whether
I should talk to them or not. Continuing to hide this knowledge became
increasingly difficult however, and in the end I conversed with them honestly.  
Apparently, my parents intended to speak with me about it when I was to get
married. Perhaps your parents are also living with the knowledge that they
must tell you the truth sooner or later. How do you feel about bringing this
up to them and relieving them of this anxiety yourself?

The widespread assumption that children being raised by foster families are
living unsatisfactory lives plays a large role in the laws governing child
custody in Japan. The Japan Times explores the [ways in which child foster
care](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070321f2.html) is conducted
shines light on the practical implications of ideological issues.

It is the tension between traditional (some might say antiquated) and modern
family values which is keeping the children living in state-run facilities
from entering into adoptive families (be it permanently, or at all), and both
sides lose as a result.

User ofukubird comments on the [estimated
length](http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/ofukubird/folder/1413765.html) of his
adoption experience:

> 自分たちの意志を確かめるため、まずある中絶防止団体に相談しました。  
>  しかし、待っている夫婦がたくさんいるということだったので、“まあ１年後までに連絡があればラッキーだね〜”なんてゆったり構えていました。

We first consulted with an anti-abortion group in order to affirm our own
volition. We learned that there are many couples waiting to adopt and prepared
for a long wait, thinking “if we're contacted within a year, we'll consider
ourselves lucky!”.

How do the attitudes in Japan influence opinion on adoptions made abroad,
particularly those of high-profile individuals adopting out developing
nations? User [yakusoku-movie](http://q.hatena.ne.jp/yakusoku-movie/) created
[a poll surveying opinions](http://q.hatena.ne.jp/1170723890) on the matter.

Recently, there have been a number of high-profile adoptions by people such as
Madonna and Angelina Jolie. How do you feel about adopting children from poor
countries? (select one)  
(Results)  
– I think it is a good thing. (10%)  
– Ambivalent (47%)  
– Because [in case] the birth parents are still alive, this should not
continue. (19%)  
– Even if the birth parents are alive, there are situations in which it is the
only viable option. (24%)

The strong presence of ambivalent opinions effectively reflects the
conflicting cultural attitudes towards adoption, illustrating how such
conflict can leave many people without a strong single opinion, which leads to
stagnation and stalls the progress of change.

A writer for ABCDane's [story
regarding](http://abcdane.net/archives/200603/jess_adopt_shitai.html) Jessica
Simpson's adoption interests includes some personal commentary:

>
> 養子を受け入れてたシングルマザーとして有名なアンジェリーナ・ジョリーのことをジェシカは「アンジェリーナ・ジョリーはすばらしいことをしたと思う。彼女のおかげで国際的な養子の受け入れ率が飛躍的に伸びたのよ。すばらしいわ」と話していた。
>
>
> 離婚の理由のひとつに、ニックは自分の子どもが欲しかった…なんていう話もありますが、子どもに「シーチキン」はチキンだ、といったことを教えるようなママにはならないで頂きたいですが。

Regarding famous single mother Angelina Jolie's adoption, Jessica Simpson
commented, “I think [she] really did something great. Thanks to her, the
number of children adopted across borders has grown rapidly. It's wonderful.”  
One of the speculated reasons for their divorce was that Nick [Lachey] wanted
to have his own children rather than adopting, however, explaining to the
children their mother's “Chicken of the Sea is chicken” comment leads me to
wish that she does not become a mother!

The comical nature of some celebrity adoptions assuredly lightens up the issue
a bit, but applied to Japan, reinforces that the current state of loosely-
defined standards and regulations on adoptions need to be tightened up, to
reconcile unfulfilled desires on the part of children and parents, but also to
ensure that children in any culture are receiving a proper marine biology
education!
