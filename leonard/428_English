Women’s roles in the ongoing Egyptian anti-government uprising have captured
the attention of bloggers and citizens spreading information on social
networking sites. The massive number of protesters taking to the streets
demanding government reforms has created a tipping point for women’s civic
participation in a country where it is risky and dangerous to demonstrate
against the authorities. Their efforts have had limited coverage in the
mainstream media.

In “[Women Are A Substantial Part of Egyptian
Protests](http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/women-are-substantial-part-
egyptian-protests)“, blogger Jenna Krajeski writes that the turnout on the
first day of the protests (January 25, 2011) included an unprecedented female
attendance. The grassroots nature of the organizing seemed to inspire a sense
of safety.

> So why are women so much more involved in this protest, called “The Day of
> Anger,” than in previous demonstrations against the Egyptian government? The
> Facebook-initiated groups are unaffiliated with a major opposition group.
> These protests also seemed safer. Organizers urged those attending to make
> it a peaceful one, and this became a rallying cry in some areas of the city
> on Tuesday. Moreover, Egypt’s educated youth, men and women, were fed up
> with a government that had not changed at all in most of their lifetimes,
> and which cuts even the educated off from any opportunity. And then there
> was Tunisia. Suddenly, attending the protest seemed not only worth the risk,
> but capable of inciting real change.

The following YouTube video The Bravest Girl in Egypt posted by
[iyadelbaghdadi](http://www.youtube.com/user/iyadelbaghdadi) features a young
woman voicing her dissent against the Mubarak regime. Her words are subtitled
in English.

  
[_Daily Beast_](http://www.thedailybeast.com/) journalist [Mike
Gilgio](http://www.thedailybeast.com/author/mike-giglio/) writes that while it
is not uncommon for women to be sexually harassed during public demonstrations
in Egypt, this time around [men were behaving in a more respectful manner
towards women in what has been dubbed the Purity
Protests](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-01-28/egypt-
revolution-the-purity-protests/) – where the idea of rallying around a
unifying struggle against The State is more important than gender-based
conflicts.

[Nour El Refai](http://www.demotix.com/users/nourelrefai/profile) also echoes
the idea of women and men as allies in his blog post “[Men and Women Equal in
Peaceful Protest Against Mubarak](http://www.demotix.com/news/570710/men-and-
women-equal-peaceful-protest-against-mubarak)“. The unifying struggle also
includes people from diverse walks of life.

> For the first time, Egyptians from all walks of life with different socio-
> economic backgrounds have joined the protests.

Yet women’s courage to step out of the shadows has not been given enough media
attention, according to [Megan Kearns](http://opinionessoftheworld.com/) who
writes in “[Taking It to the Streets: Egyptian Women Protest the Government
Alongside the Men Yet Few Images of
Women](http://opinionessoftheworld.com/2011/01/31/egyptian-women-take-to-the-
streets-alongside-the-men-to-protest-the-government/)“:

> Night after night, women and men have defied the government imposed curfew
> in Cairo, gathering in Tahrir Square, aka Liberation Square. A “Million
> Person March” towards the presidential palace is planned for tomorrow and a
> nationwide strike planned for Wednesday. Egyptian civilians say they won’t
> stop protesting until President Mubarek steps down from office. And women in
> Egypt will be advocating for justice too. But when the media doesn’t show
> images of women involved, it appears as if they aren’t entrenched in
> rallying revolutions; they are written out of history.

Women's participation is being documented through social networking sites,
such as the [Women of Egypt Facebook
page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Women-Of-Egypt/188702194487956?v=wall)
created by Barcelona-based [Leil-Zahra
Mortada](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=586357675). As of January 31,
2011 at 6:00 pm US Eastern Standard Time (EST), the material on the page
included four albums with more than 130 images portraying women of varying
ages, including some dressed in burqas, others wearing head scarves and some
in more western attire. A common theme is an expression of anger and
confrontation with the police.

A number of these photographs are also making the rounds on photo-sharing
websites. [Twitpic](http://twitpic.com/) users
[Kardala](http://twitpic.com/photos/Kardala),
[Farrah3m](http://twitpic.com/photos/Farrah3m) and
[sGardinier](http://twitpic.com/photos/SGardinier) retweeted some of the
images of the women protesters, whilst photo-sharing applications
[Plixi](http://plixi.com/p/73283865) and
[Picasa](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/view?q=egyptiam+women+protesters&psc=G&filter=1#5568382447913683410)
were also utilized for similar purposes. The blogs
[Subterfusex](http://subterfusex.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/women-protesters-of-
egypt/) and [Seilo@GeekyOgre](http://seilo.geekyogre.com/2011/01/women-of-
