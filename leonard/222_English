The recent escalation by the Government of the crisis at the Fukushima power
plant [from a category five to category
seven](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/tsunamiupdate01.html), the highest
level, now puts it on a par with the disastrous accident at the Chernobyl
power plant in Russia in 1986. Even as a category five disaster it had
prompted an unprecedented outpouring of public criticism in Japanese society.

Open protests against Tepco as operator and the government as monitor had been
relatively muted until recently, but this has now changed. [Tepco was
responsible](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iU29-CtBza8xA01r9IzPwksyP1WQ?docId=9e518d4998224fd8b705cc3fe9903eb6)
for the placement and maintenance of obsolete structures and for failing to
ensure adequate safety measures and backup systems that would have guaranteed
a working cooling system despite the strong quakes and tsunami. Governments,
both past and present are seen as complicit for their inadequate supervision
and inspections of the facility as well as for the recent extension of Tepco's
operating permit.

On April 10, 2011, [more than 15,000 people gathered in Tokyo
streets](http://www.japanprobe.com/2011/04/11/thousands-participate-in-tokyo-
anti-nuclear-protest/) to protest against the nuclear power industry and the
problems it had caused. In a city with over 13 million people this might seem
like a very small number but it was the first time that ordinary people had
taken to the streets to voice their opposition to nuclear power. As further
proof of the widespread anger another 10,000 people followed the protest on
Ustream thanks to [Yasumi Iwakami](http://iwakamiyasumi.com/)’s team who
broadcast the event live.

**Reluctance to criticize?**

For many foreigners however, used to much bigger numbers of demonstrators in
their own countries, doubts remain. Why do Japanese people seem so reluctant
to criticize the company and industry responsible for this man made disaster
and the government which let it all happen?

A recent [discussion appearing on Twitter](http://togetter.com/li/120359)
shows that a lack of open protest does not mean that the Japanese people have
not been questioning or complaining of the actions of the authorities as some
foreigners have implied.

The following thread originated from a foreigner's doubt that was expressed to
user [@SaveJPN](http://twitter.com/SaveJPN):

> とても深い。深くて悔しい。->「今日、外国の記者に『大地震の直後であっても礼儀や秩序を守る姿に世界中が感銘をうけて称賛したが、いま人災を撒
> き散らす政府に抗議の声もあげない日本人に世界は冷ややかな目を向けている。彼らはただ集団行動をしただけだ』といわれた」

z_kakiya: RT @SaveJPN: Very deep. Deep, but frustrating -> “Today, a foreign
journalist said to me ‘the world was impressed and praised the Japanese for
being so courteous and orderly even straight after such a hug e earthquake.
But now, they’ve turned a cold eye, since they don’t event voice protest
against their government who’s now spreading man-made disaster. All they did
was conform to the group.’

Reflecting on the foreigner's words, some readers began to wonder whether, for
the Japanese, it's deemed more socially appropriate not to raise voices in
complaint when something goes wrong.

Arugha_Satoru: @z_kakiya Haha, sorry~ I’d make a lot of people unhappy if I
give a serious reply – I guess it's kinda like you look more decent if you
just keep quiet

> @[z_kakiya](http://twitter.com/#!/z_kakiya/status/55255343210565632):
> @Arugha_Satoru んですよね……。 直接抗議がスタンダードから遠いからなあ……。 実際非常に厳しいですしね……。

z_kakiya: @Arugha_Satoru yea…. Protesting is far from the norm for us… it's
really hard to do in reality

However, Inuinu_void questioned this, blaming the Japanese media who have been
covering up Tepco's faults as it is one of the major sponsors of many
television shows.

> る。それに気づくのか？外国人は。

@Inuinu_void: I’ll say it straight – how’s the Japanese people ‘supposed’ to
express their anger? Even if they did, the media is on TEPCO’s side so they’re
not gonna report it properly anyway. I heard only the professional people are
actually voicing their opinion. Japanese people’s anger is brewing under the
surface like magma right now. I don’t think foreigners are gonna understand
that

Attempting an interpretation of the Japanese mentality in such a situation,
Arugha_Satoru says the lack of protest might be due to a general desire not to
spark panic that might hinder those who are trying to manage the emergency.

> 東電とかに怒りをぶつけるヒマがあったら現地助けろよ！ が日本人の大まかな（一般的な）共通見解なんじゃないのかな

@Arugha_Satoru: ‘If you’re so bored that have time to show your anger towards
TEPCO, go out and help the people in the disaster areas!!’ Is the general
thought of the Japanese I guess

> あとは「現地で略奪とかパニックになるくらいなら怒りはあっても今は我慢するべきだろ、別にそこまでグローバルスタンダードになる必要なし！」 かな。

@Arugha_Satoru: And they probably think ‘if it’s gonna cause looting and
panic, we might as well hold in our anger for now. We don’t really need to
conform to global standards anyway’

Kenokabe says he doesn't agree with the ‘be quiet, you won't change the things
anyway’ kind of thinking because only by voicing criticisms will problems be
solved.

> @[kenokabe](http://twitter.com/#!/kenokabe/status/55407732978753536):「声をあげない」ことを美徳とする結果、横並び「和」を上等とするくせに「同調圧力」という横並びには嫌悪感がある。デモとか熱心にやってる人らをもう横目でニヤニヤするような空気はよくないとおもう。

@kenokabe: As a result of thinking that ‘not voicing opinion’ is a virtue, the
idea of group ‘harmony’ is considered to be good. But at the same time,
there’s a dislike of ’peer pressure’. I don’t think it’s good to smirk at
those people who are actively protesting.

> @Inuinu_void:

@kenokabe: I said this before, but my opinion is that the only way of making a
change is for each person to ‘voice their opinions’ one by one. But then at
the same time, some people are tweeting that ’making a racket isn’t gonna
change anything’. What do you think? RT @Inuinu_void:

> 許したくない対象は東電や、現場の処置を不透明にしてしまっている不甲斐ない政府なのだけれど、それらてっぺんのどうしようも無い存在を今迄許してきた私にだって責任はあるのだ。だから、より、尚更、腹立たしい。

@kenokabe: Looks like people abroad are starting to get fed up with us
Japanese RT @ququri: The people I’m angry with are TEPCO and the spineless
government that are keeping information to themselves. But then, I’m
responsible too for tolerating those useless people at the top. That why it’s
even more frustrating

Besides the recent street protests in Tokyo, a wider section of the Japanese
people have been reacting and showing appraisal for a song titled ‘It was a
lie all along’ by singer [Kazuyoshi Saito](http://www.kazuyoshi-saito.com/)
which has already recorded more than 491,000 views. The lyrics have been
translated here.

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b01yohRgfyc>

Take a walk through this country – 54 nuclear power plants  
Textbooks and TV commercials said ‘it’s safe’  
Deceived us, and their excuse is ‘unexpected’  
Sweet memories of the sky, tickled by black rain  
It was a lie all along  
See, you got caught  
It really was a lie  
Nuclear power is safe  
It was a lie all along  
Wanna eat spinach  
It was a lie all along  
You knew about the situation right?  
Can’t stop the radiation dancing in the wind now  
After how many people are exposed will they finally realize – this country’s
government  
Found nice water away from this city?  
Tell me about it  
Actually, don’t. There’s no escape  
It was a lie all along  
Tokyo Electric, Hokuriku Electric, Chubu Electric, Kyushu Electric – no more
dreams  
It was all crap  
But they’re still gonna carry on  
It really was crap  
Wanna do something with this feeling  
It was a lie all along  
It really was crap
