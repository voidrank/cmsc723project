Zahra Bahrami

According to
[Dutch](http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/1829443/2011/01/29/Iran-
executeert-Nederlands-Iraanse-om-drugs.dhtml) and [international news
media](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12314886), Dutch-Iranian
Zahra Bahrami has been executed in Iran after having been found guilty of
drug-related crimes and sentenced to death on 2 January. She was arrested on
27 December 2009 when she reportedly attended an anti-government demonstration
during a visit to Tehran.

The Campaign to Free Political Prisoners in Iran [wrote a letter to the Dutch
Ministry of Foreign
Affairs](http://www.iranpoliticalprisoners.com/data/100907_zahra_bahrami.htm)
[en] in September 2010 urging them to make demands to Iran for her release.
Amnesty International's Dutch section also took up [Bahrami's
cause](http://www.amnesty.nl/in_actie_actie/68730) [nl] under strong suspicion
that Bahrami never received a fair trial. This morning, they reported the news
of her execution on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/amnestynl/status/31273565345026048):

Some people, like @VrolijkRechts, wanted to do more than just
[tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/VrolijkRechts/status/31278040080191488) [nl]
about it:

> Beste mensen. Hoe laat zijn jullie bij de Iraanse ambassade om jullie te
> laten horen? Of blijven wij boos twitteren? #Zahra #Bahrami

Come on everyone, what time shall we meet at the Iranian embassy to raise our
voices? Or will we just post angry tweets about it? #Zahra #Bahrami

Others, such as @bobbraak, called on the Dutch government to [take
action](http://twitter.com/#!/bobbraak/status/31279735111684097) [nl]:

> vanmiddag om 17:00 uur gaat er vlucht naar tehran. Uri, die kan de iraanse
> ambassadeur mooi nog halen! #bahrami

There's a flight to Tehran at 5pm today. Uri [first name of Dutch Minister of
Foreign Affairs], the Iranian ambassador still has plenty of time to catch it!
#bahrami

@Leon_Bosma [puts things into
perspective](http://twitter.com/#!/Leon_Bosma/status/31281956033396736) [nl]:

> Veel verontwaardiging over #Bahrami. Zonder af te willen doen, wat maakt één
> staatsmoord zo belangrijk versus bv. de ruim 30 in #Egypte?

A lot of indignation about #Bahrami. Without taking anything away from this
case, what makes one state murder this important compared to more than 30 in
#Egypt?

@BartNijman is
[skeptical](http://twitter.com/#!/BartNijman/status/31318443475079169) [nl]
about the case:

> Als op drugsdelicten in Iran de doodstraf staat, waarom zou voor een Iraans-
> Nederlandse dan wat anders moeten gelden? #bahrami #iran

If drugs-related crimes are a capital offence in Iran, then why shouldn't this
apply to an Iranian-Dutch woman? #bahrami #iran

The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran posted a [reaction from
Bahrami's
lawyer](http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2011/01/zahra_bahrami_exeuted_tehran/)
[en]:

> I am shocked. I was absolutely not informed about this. They should have
> informed her lawyer of the execution, but I had no idea. I don’t know what
> to say. Just that I am shocked.

On Saturday afternoon, Dutch newspaper _de Volkskrant_
[reported](http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/1829563/2011/01/29/Executie-
Bahrami-bevestigd-contacten-met-Iran-bevroren.dhtml) [nl] that the Iranian
ambassador in the Netherlands has confirmed that Bahrami has indeed been
executed, upon which the Netherlands immediately froze all ties with Iran. The
Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, Uri Rosenthal, calls the case “a scandal,
committed by a barbarian regime”.
