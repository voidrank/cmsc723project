[Composer Eric Whitacre ](http://ericwhitacre.wordpress.com), after seeing a
Youtube video of a young soprano singing his song “Sleep” wondered: What if he
could get people, regardless of where they were in the world, to record
themselves signing all the other parts of his _a capella_ choir piece? So he
did, and following, you will be able to see the various results of this great
experiment of online collaboration with the Virtual Choir.

In _[How We Did It](http://ericwhitacre.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/the-virtual-
choir-how-we-did-it/) _he explains not only the process for the last iteration
of his project but also the preceding experiments in conforming a virtual
choir. For the first time around, he asked singers to buy a specific music
track and just sing along to the _a capella_ (without instrumental
accompaniment) recording. Scott Haines, whom he had met only once before,
volunteered to edit the piece. Here is the result:

Thrilled with the result, he decided to do it once again, but this time making
it even more like an actual choral experience:

> So this time, I made my own conductor track, filming it in complete silence,
> hearing the music only in my head. Then I watched the video and played in
> the piano accompaniment part to my conductor track… Then I offered the sheet
> music as a free download. As singers began posting their individual tracks,
> I called for ‘auditions’ for the soprano solo.

This [next video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh1c2xWVWiA) shows the
instructions Eric Whitacre posted for all participants. It includes
recommendations on how to perform the piece, explanation about the recording
dynamic and the conducting track where he directs the choir:

For the virtual choir, 128 people representing 12 different countries
including Argentina, New Zealand, The Philippines, Singapore and Spain sent in
the 243 tracks that compose the choral piece Lux Aurumque that Scott Haines
once again helped produce.

This is what Mr. Whitacre wrote about the finished product:

> When I saw the finished video for the first time I actually teared up. The
> intimacy of all the faces, the sound of the singing, the obvious poetic
> symbolism about our shared humanity and our need to connect; all of it
> completely overwhelmed me. And it must be said that a lot of the credit for
> it’s beauty should go to Scottie Haines, who spent untold hours editing and
> polishing the video. (BTW, Scottie and I have never met only met once in the
> ‘real world’, unlike 99% of the Virtual Choir, whom I’ve never ‘met’).

Lets hope the Virtual Choir continues growing strong!
