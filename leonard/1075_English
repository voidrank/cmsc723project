President Yudhoyono has been through a series of ultimate lows in his previous
administration term, ranging from natural disasters like the 2004 Aceh tsunami
and 2006 Central Java earthquake, to separatism threats coming from the
country's easternmost provinces.

The former Army general also managed to reach agreement between the central
government with GAM (Free Aceh Movement), a separatist group which has been
aiming to establish Aceh as an independent Muslim state.

Corruption remains a big issue in Indonesia. Corruption is a known factor that
chased away investors, both domestic and foreign. Because of its prevalence in
the country, Indonesian development plans remain in status quo.

Back in 2004, President Yudhoyono made [corruption eradication one of his top
priority on his first 100
days](http://www.tempo.co.id/hg/nasional/2004/10/09/brk,20041009-04,id.html),
since then prosecutions have been made including [one of Yudhoyono's in
laws](http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct2=us%2F0_0_s_7_0_t&usg=AFQjCNHca52ItlBh2l-2Jby_Sdy6dCc_bg&cid=0&ei=lKLdSvjvIYaq_ga7n5CqAQ&rt=SEARCH&vm=STANDARD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thejakartapost.com%2Fnews%2F2009%2F10%2F07%2Ftouching-
the-untouchables039.html) but no real change among public servants – bribery,
cronyism, and nepotism are still considered as popular highways to success.

In this year's [inaugural speech](http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/sbys-
inaugural-speech-the-text/336551), the president said that the spirit of
perseverance and the spirit of not giving up are important to uphold good
governance and eradicate corruption, however he didn't highlight corruption
eradication as his administration priority.

Despite so, according to one report[ the people see the president's effort in
combating corruption as
positive](http://www.detiknews.com/read/2009/10/20/184901/1225230/10/masyarakat-
puas-kinerja-pemberantasan-korupsi-sby) [id].

Indonesian bloggers have high hopes on Yudhoyono's new administration.

Even though the new cabinet is not yet formed, some Indonesian bloggers have
already written their opinions.

[Lila](http://politikana.com/profil/lila.html)
[wrote](http://politikana.com/baca/2009/10/19/pesta-pora-depkominfo-dipegang-
pks.html) an article on [Politikana](http://politikana.com/), a 2.0 platform
popular among Indonesian political commentators, saying that the successor of
the minister of communication might jeapordize freedom of expression and
eventually, online freedom:

> Dipilihnya Tifatul Sembiring dari PKS untuk memimpin Departemen komunikasi
> dan Informatika memberikan kesan bahwa duet SBY dan Boediono kurang menaruh
> perhatian yang serius pada departemen strategis.
>
> […]
>
> ketakutan akan kecendrungan PKS sebagai garda depan pengusung UU Anti
> Pornografi untuk melakukan pensensoran internet besar besaran. Bagi
> pengelola situs yang memuat Miyabi atau forum macam Kaskus (BB17) harus
> sudah siap siap dibredel atau tidak dapat diakses dari Indonesia.

By appointing Tifatul Sembiring from the PKS party to lead the Department of
Communication and Information gives the impression that the Yudhoyono and
Boediono duo isn't putting enough attention on strategic ministries.
