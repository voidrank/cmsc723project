Recently, Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian blogger and political activist (who was
[interviewed by GV](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/20/blogger-
dobrokhotov-would-be-glad-if-russian-authorities-restrict-internet/) [EN] last
year), [has conducted an
investigation](http://dobrokhotov.livejournal.com/475018.html) [RUS] on how
paid blogger networks function in the Russian blogosphere. He wrote that
different representatives of the paid blogger network had contacted him three
times, offering from $23 to $50 per post. Every blogger who agrees to provide
content for a fee is supposed to choose a unique angle when writing about a
certain topic. The latest offer that Dobrokhotov received was quite unusual:
to write positive comments about the Russian police:

> Менеджер компании Garin-studio предложил мне разместить целую серию постов с
> «позитивом» про милицию. За первый пост – 2000 р., за остальные – по тыще. Я
> выяснил под разными предлогами более подробную информацию. Заказчиком

A manager of the company _Garin-studio_ offered me to post a whole series of
posts with some positive content about the police. For the first post – 2,000
rubles ($63), all others – 1,000 rubles each ($31). I've managed to unearth
more detailed information. It turned out that the client of the company is the
federal Ministry of the Interior, not the Moscow Police Department; what is
even more interesting, the order was from the Department of Internal Security
[which is supposed to control and monitor the police itself] (aha, so that's
what they do!). There are 50 bloggers involved in this project, though with
some of them, with the most popular (for example, with Radulova), the client
is in direct contact. Garin-studio, as far as I understood, isn't the only
contractor used by [the Ministry of the Interior].

Other bloggers [spotted](http://oleg-kozyrev.livejournal.com/2830514.html)
[RUS] some nearly simultaneous posts with positive comments about the police
at [Natalia Radulova's blog](http://radulova.livejournal.com/1770253.html)
[RUS] and at another popular blog by [_Maxim
Aleksandrov_](http://ma79.livejournal.com/1445257.html) [RUS].

Dobrokhotov has counted at least 38 bloggers who allegedly have contracts with
_Garin-studio_ and are involved in the “police campaign,” some top-ranking
bloggers among them. He has analysed how many popular bloggers wrote about the
same things at the same time: some 75 bloggers have posted similar posts about
mobile applications within one week (including such Top-25 bloggers as
_ibigdan_ , _katoga_ , _allan999_ , _bydyry_ and _sviridenkov_ ); 17 bloggers
or so have posted about weight loss medications.

Generally speaking, paid bloggers are a global phenomenon. In the United
States in 2009, approximately [8.5 percent of all the bloggers were paid for
what they wrote](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124026415808636575.html)
[EN]. As the line between blogging and journalism becomes blurred, the former
stops being just a hobby and turns into a profession. David Armano explains
the process of [placing paid content in the mainstream and social
media](http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/2009/02/thoughts-on-bought-
earned.html) [EN]:

> The business of buying media has been around as long as marketing and in the

In Russia, too, there are vast networks of paid bloggers, who, until recently,
hadn't been exposed. There are blog “markets” (like _blogun.ru_ ), where
media-planners can order a post or a link concerning a certain topic or
product. Usually it works like this: sometimes bloggers produce and are paid
for content (e.g., tutorials, thematic materials on a certain subject), and
sometimes they are paid to promote selected products (i.e., for subtle
advertising). A lighter version of the “paid media” is “compensated media”: a
blogger writes about some gadget he/she received as a gift or an event he/she
got invited to. Many people would trust certain bloggers more than they would
trust newspaper articles or TV commercials – the way they'd trust someone they
know in person, a friend. This is part of what makes blogs such an attractive
venue for those who are willing to promote a product or an event.

The idea of a paid blog is that it uses this private channel of communication
and gets more efficient in promoting certain things or ideas. Of course,
there's always a moral dilemma: if a blog is supposed to provide personal
information and is intended to offer “real communication,” hidden
advertisement “violates” the unspoken contract between the blogger and his/her
readers, which is based on mutual respect and sincerity.

There are certain peculiarities about the Russian blogosphere. First of all,
since the majority of most popular Russian blogs are hosted by LiveJournal,
hidden advertisement is actually illegal. LJ's [Terms of
Service](http://www.livejournal.com/legal/tos.bml) clearly restrict
unsolicited or unauthorized advertisement (Article 7 of Member Conduct part
says: “You agree to NOT use the Service to: … Upload, post or otherwise
transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials,
‘junk mail,’ ‘spam,’ ‘chain letters,’ ‘pyramid schemes,’ or any other form of
solicitation.”). This rule is widely ignored. Only one popular blogger, LJ
user _tema_ , [tried to promote](http://tema.livejournal.com/336116.html)
[RUS] authorised LiveJournal ads, but his initiatives never really found
support among other popular bloggers.

What is even more important – and Dobrokhotov's case described above
illustrates it vividly – is that the networks of paid bloggers sometimes turn
to advocating certain political views or to promoting the official political
agenda. The blogger's investigation brings more transparency to this “grey
zone” of RuNet. Exposed paid bloggers are less influential, since readers
understand that they advocate certain points of view because they're paid to
do that. Another thing is that Dobrokhotov has uncovered one of the practices
that the Ministry of the Interior conducts online to influence the Russian
public opinion, thus raising an important issue: is it appropriate for a
government institution to be using controversial marketing methods?
