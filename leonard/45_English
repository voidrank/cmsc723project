The recent investigation done by journalists of [Plaza
Publica](http://www.plazapublica.com.gt/) in Guatemala has uncovered how
government authorities, although legally having to prevent child labor, allow
children under 14 years of age to work in their cane fields, which is a
physically demanding and dangerous work.

In the article _[Child labor and exploitation in Guatemala's
sugar](http://www.plazapublica.com.gt/content/trabajo-infantil-y-explotacion-
laboral-en-el-azucar-de-guatemala)_ Alberto Arce and Martín Rodríguez Pellecer
explain how children work in the sugar fields where workers are paid by
tonnage cut. While most adult workers cut two to three tons, that doesn't even
add up to minimum wage, about 7.5 USD per day. One of the families
interviewed, where the father works with his two sons, one 12 and the other
13, don't even make minimum wage between the three of them.

> Para llegar al salario mínimo, con un salario de Q20 por tonelada es
> necesario superar las tres toneladas diarias. Para el finquero, la media
> normal que un cortador puede extraer es de seis toneladas. Los cortadores
> dicen que a partir de dos o tres es inhumano.

To reach the minimum wage, with a salary of Q20 per ton it is needed to cut
more than three tons daily. For the plantation owner, the normal amount a
cutter can extract is of 6 tons. The cutters say that more than two or three
is inhuman.

Following is the [short video ](http://youtu.be/ZnyozbhB624)they shot as they
went into a sugar cane plantation to take photographs using an antique wooden
camera. From the article:

> Plaza Pública ingresó sin pedir permiso a la propiedad privada de Kuhsiek
> para hacer unas fotografías artísticas sobre trabajadores de la caña. En ese
> momento, no se sabía quién era el dueño de la finca. Ya dentro se descubrió
> el trabajo infantil. Allí, en una conversación informal entre el empresario
> agrícola, uno de los reporteros que escriben esta nota y el fotógrafo
> Rodrigo Abd, se acordó una entrevista formal en su oficina de la capital.

Plaza Pública went in without asking permission to the private property of
Kuhsiek, to take some artistic photographs of cane workers. In that moment, it
wasn't known who the owner of the plantation was. Once inside, the child labor
was discovered. There, in an informal conversation between the agricultural
businessmen, one of the reporters writing this note and the photographer
Rodrigo Abd a formal interview in his office in the capital was agreed upon.

The greatest irony is perhaps that the owner of the Flamenco plantation is no
other than Otto Kuhsiek, the president of the Guatemalan Chamber of
Agriculture. In the interview, he didn't deny that children may go to the
fields, but suggested that they don't actually work there:

> El presidente de la Cámara del Agro se define como una persona que trata de
> cumplir con la Ley: “No conozco las edades de los niños que se encontraban
> en mi finca, que estaban, en todo caso, en su período vacacional. Usted vio
> que había una escuela en frente de donde estaban. Y esos niños no son
> trabajadores, sino que vienen acompañando a sus padres. Son sus ayudantes
> (…) .

The President of the Chamber of Agriculture defines himself as a law abiding
person: “I don't know the ages of the children found in my farm, who were, in
any case, in the holiday season. You saw that there was a school in front of
where they were. And those children aren't workers, but they come with their
parents. They are their helpers “.

He went on to explain that workers are not exploited since they are free to go
when they are tired. However, the journalists point out that at 5 pm workers
can still be seen in the fields and because they are paid for what they can
cut, they may be forced to chosing between feeding their families or getting
some rest.

On twitter, under the hashtag
[#11deazucar](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%2311deazucar), Guatemanal
journalist [Alejandra Gutierrez
](https://twitter.com/#!/alegutierrezv/status/157489893793202176)tries to take
the focus from placing blame into the lives of these children:

> ¿Los cañeros? ¿los azucareros? ¿los compradores? ¿los padres? ¿el Estado? La
> tragedia es que esos niños tengan que trabajar. #11deazucar

The sugar cane cutters? the sugar workers? the buyers? the parents? the state?
The tragedy is that these children have to work. #11deazucar

Child labor in the sugar cane fields is not new: back in 2007, [this
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPxmPpaMaFU) with pictures of sugar cane
workers in Guatemala, including children was uploaded on YouTube.

Although the sugar industry in Guatemala is one of the fastest growing and
highest grossing in Guatemala, this growth and wealth is not passed on to the
people farther down in the chain. In fact, the sugar association that brings
together the 13 sugar processing plants in Guatemala, Asazgua, only guarantees
a minimum wage for those who work processing the sugar, not those who cut it
and believes the problems of the cane workers exposed are neither examples of
child labor or, in fact, their problem, since they are cutters and not sugar
workers: since they are providers they are not part of Asazgua and it is not
up to them to stop this from happening.

In the Plaza Publica article, Arce and Rodriguez tell of how the plantation
owners and Asazgua show themselves as victims, suggesting that child work at
the plantations is the farmers’ choice, and that not allowing children to work
at the fields might lead to the farmers or their children burning down the
fields and sabotage the production.

The article and investigation had results, but sadly, not as expected.

althought the Finca Flamenco farm ceased operations as a consequence of the
article on sugar in @PlazaPublicaGT, there are cane workers who lost their
jobs in Retalhuleu.
