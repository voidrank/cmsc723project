The all too familiar sound of Japan's [Earthquake Early
Warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_Early_Warning_\(Japan\))
system (緊急地震速報 Kinkyū Jishin Sokuhō) has become stuck in people's heads after
being regularly broadcast on television and via mobile phone alerts, as
aftershocks continue in the days following the [major
earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/11/largest-earthquake-in-
recorded-history-in-japan/) on March 11, 2011. The regular warning tone is
played a few seconds before each tremor:

The Warning is broadcast by the [Japan Meteorological
Agency](http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/Activities/eew1.html):

> The Earthquake Early Warning system provides advance announcement of the
> estimated seismic intensities and expected arrival time of principal motion.
> These estimations are based on prompt analysis of the focus and magnitude of
> the earthquake using wave form data observed by seismographs near the
> epicenter.
>
> The Earthquake Early Warning is aimed at mitigating earthquake-related
> damage by allowing countermeasures such as promptly slowing down trains,
> controlling elevators to avoid danger and enabling people to quickly protect
> themselves in various environments such as factories, offices, houses and
> near cliffs.

The sound is starting to wear on citizens, as these comments on microblogging
site Twitter show:

> 緊急地震速報がトラウマレベル

The Earthquake Early Warning is becoming traumatic.

> 地震速報関連の音がやばい怖い。なんなのあのやたら注意をひく不協和音は・・・

The sound of the Earthquake Early Warning is extremely scary. Did they have to
make it such an inharmonic tone?

I duck underneath the table every time I hear the Warning. It's like an air-
raid siren. Securing food, trying to confirm the safety of loved ones,
unfounded rumors, a feeling of scarcity… it's like the world of the wartime
stories that my grandmother used to tell me. Yesterday, I threw away some
refrigerator coolant by accident, and it reminded me of the [_mottaina_
i](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottainai) [‘waste not, want not’] spirit of
my grandmother, who never threw away anything.

Scared (>_< )(>_< )(>_< ) Earthquake warning (>_< )

**Mobile alerts**

Mobile phone companies have been offering a service that alerts mobile phones
whenever the Warning goes out:

> 未だに緊急地震速報の音が怖くて、TVと携帯がダブルで鳴ると手が震えてしまうんだ。

The sound of the Earthquake Early Warning still scares me, and my hands start
shaking when the television plays it and my cell phone starts buzzing.

I'm so tired… just heard the Earthquake Warning again in Nagano Prefecture.
The sounds coming from my cell phone really are the essence of “warnings” and
they scare me. The magnitude isn't always big but we don't know when the next
big one will come. It frays my nerves each time the Warning on my cell phone
rings…

It's scary, isn't it? A low, mechanical-sounding male voice says “Earthquake
incoming” on my phone. RT @highme_karan: For sure! That sound is frightening.
RT @mio2mio: Wonder if they could change the sound of the Earthquake Early
Warning to the jingle that the
[Drifters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters_\(Japanese_band\))
[Japanese comedy group] use when leaving the stage?

Here's an iPhone app that offers a similar alert system:

@kiske suggests an alternative to the Warning that would be easier on the
ears:

> [@kiske](http://twitter.com/#!/kiske_/status/47190002219749378):
> 緊急地震速報のアレ恐いから ブライアン・イーノに新しいの頼んで

The sound of the Warning is so scary. Can we get Brian Eno to compose a new
melody?

> [@kotetsu1968](http://twitter.com/#!/kotetsu1968/status/47217949676806144):
> そういえばさっき京急の中で一斉に緊急地震速報の音が色んな人の携帯から鳴っていた。凄い緊迫感だった。

Oh, and when I was in the Keikyu Train, different earthquake warning sounds
started ringing from everyone's cell phones at the same time. An extreme sense
of urgency filled the train.

> [@sheriii_m](http://twitter.com/#!/sheriii_m/status/47217717048123392):
> 仕事中に今まで聞いたことのないような音がみんなの携帯から鳴った。地震速報でした。怯えるように仕事を続けたけど、みんな無事。生きてるってすばらしいね！

In our workplace, everyone's cell phones started ringing at once, making a
sound that had never been heard before. It was the Earthquake Early Warning.
We continued to work although we were terrified. Everyone is okay. It's
wonderful to be alive, isn't it?!
