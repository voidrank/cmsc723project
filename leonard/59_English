Nadine Bari in the documentary

Nadine Bari is a French citizen who resides half the time in
[Guinea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea) in West Africa and the other
half on the French island
[Réunion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union), in the Indian ocean.

Mrs. Bari lost her husband [Abdoulaye “Djibril”
Barry](http://www.campboiro.org/victimes/barry_abdoulaye_djibril.html) during
one of the violent repressions in Guinea that were customary under the
dictatorship of [Sékou
Touré](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_S%C3%A9kou_Tour%C3%A9). Twenty-five
years ago, she created a non-governmental organization that supports women,
the disabled, and the rural population of Guinea.

**Global Voices (GV): How did you end up in Guinea?**

> **Nadine Bari (NB):** I first arrived in Guinea in January of 1964 to follow
> my Guinean husband. We were both quite thrilled to have the opportunity to
> put our diplomas and youthful energy to use for the development of the newly
> independent nation (not for the regime at the time though). My husband
> disappeared in 1971. The first book I wrote, “[Grain de
> sable](http://www.campboiro.org/bibliotheque/nadine/grain_sable/tdm.html)”
> was about my quest to find out the truth about his death (the documentary
> [“I was still waiting for you yesterday” directed by Catherine Veaux-
> Logeat](http://www.fcat.es/FCAT/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=item&item_id=345&Itemid=37)
> also retraced this quest).

**GV: Tell us about your organization?**

> **NB:** It is called [Guinée-Solidarité](www.guinee-solidarite.org ) (GS).
> It was established in Strasbourg, France in 1987. During two trips to Guinea
> in 1985 and 1986, I could not help but take notice of the economic and
> social downfall of the country. For instance, in Koundara-Youkounkoun, I was
> stupefied to see that the school of Ouros did not have benches for the
> students. They had to bring their own seat otherwise they were not allowed
> in class. In one classroom, the teacher used an electricity mast that had
> fallen down as a desk for the kids. The health center had very little
> medication in stock, some were even expired. With the photos that my
> daughter took, we raised awareness in our church in Strasbourg. One of the
> choir singers worked for a transportation company and offered to fill a few
> containers with materials that we collected from hospitals, schools and
> companies in Alsace and send them to Guinea. That's how everything started.

**GV: How did Guinée-Solidarité help reduce the impact of poverty in Guinea?**

> **NB:** We targeted the villages that were kind of forgotten by
> international aid. The ones that were difficult to reach and especially
> downtrodden, in the Guinean forest and in Northern Guinea. In 1986-87, we
> were shocked to see that the patients in the hospital in the village of Mali
> (in the [Fouta-Djallon](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouta-Djalon) region)
> were sleeping on the floor. We raised awareness again in Alsace and the
> surrounding regions to collect medical materials. In total, 7 state
> hospitals, 12 health centers and 18 health units benefited from the
> initiative. One of our priorities was to help the disabled (either the
> crippled, blind or socially outcast groups). We trained some of them in the
> use of bicycles or tricycles.

**GV: What is Guinée-Solidarité doing specifically for women?**

> **NB:** We have helped create a clothing workshop where women imprint an
> indigo dye on fabrics. We also support widows who are gardening in Fello
> Wendou in the Fouta-Djalon region. We were able to get funds from
> Switzerland to plant [indigo trees.](http://www.guinee-
> solidarite.org/articles.php3?lien=47) The project began in 2007 and it
> builds on the skills of Fulani women and how they weave traditional fabrics.
> Unfortunately, the chinese textile industry has now injected the local
> market with cheaper fabrics at a cost with which we cannot compete if we
> wish to sustain our workers.

**GV: Educating poor and disabled children is one of your major success
stories. How did you go about the project?**

> **NB:** In la Cité de Solidarité, a neighborhood of Conakry [the capital]
> known to be the homeless and beggars quarter, we knew of at least 450
> disabled people. None knew how to read. We found 80 of them, mostly girls
> and children, sponsors in France, Spain and Belgium. The criteria to benefit
> from a sponsor was that the child had to be an orphan or disabled. Many
> begging children – even the blind ones – were able to attend college, at
> Gamal Abdel Nasser or Sonfonia University in Conakry. A library was opened
> for the children of la Cité and the neighborhood Jean-Paul II. It is very
> well-attended. We even installed solar panels to provide electricity on a
> regular basis.

Guinée-Solidarité has 4 main branches: Strasbourg, Marseille (that has been
financing a major rehabilitation center for the disabled in
[Mamou](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamou)), Paris and Conakry.
