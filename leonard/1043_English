In the last few years, and due to the relative freedom on the internet in
Jordan, a number of online social initiatives have risen to the surface.
_[Ikbis.com](http://www.ikbis.com)_ , _[7iber.com](http://www.7iber.com)_ ,
and _[Watwet](http://www.watwet.com)_ are just some examples of what young
Jordanians have developed to find better and more effective ways to express
themselves freely and without restrictions. Of all these brilliant
initiatives, one that stands out for using the cutting-edge technologies of
the 21st century to provoke a dialogue on social, political, economic, and
environmental issues that concern the Jordanian public is
_[Aramram](http://www.aramram.com)_.

In video segments of three to five minutes, _Aramram_ highlights various
phenomena that exist in Jordan. _[Amahl Khouri](http://twitter.com/amahl)_ and
_[I](http://www.twitter.com/mazraq)_ decided to do an interview with _Aramram_
for the second phase of the[ Young Leaders Visitors
Program](http://www.si.se/English/Navigation/Scholarships-and-
exchanges/Leadership-programs/Young-Leaders-Visitors-Program/) being held in
Paris later this month, and find out more specifically about their work on the
dialogue between the subcultures and ethnicities that a live in Jordan:

In addition to their work in Jordan, _Aramram_ hopes to expand and do similar
projects in other Arab country to encourage young people to embrace the
information age and utilize the internet to its full potential.
