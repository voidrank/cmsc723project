[The recent assassination of a woman by the alleged father of her baby, and a
promising young Brazilian
goalkeeper](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/09/brazil-footballer-
bruno-fernandes-accused-murder), has been on the media spotlight, shocking the
country for the level of violence involved in the crime. At the same time,
[Instituto Sangari](http://www.institutosangari.org.br/instituto/) [pt], a non
profit for social awareness on scientific culture based in São Paulo,
published its 2010 [Map of Violence in
Brazil](http://www.institutosangari.org.br/mapadaviolencia/) [pt] stating that
10 women are assassinated everyday in the country. Inevitably, the blogsphere
put the two together and condemnation of such crimes became a hot topic beyond
the sensationalist broadcasting of mainstream media, which has been limited to
the footballer's crime.

According to Nilcéa Freire, minister of women policies, [violence against
women is in fact largely ignored by the
media](http://paulonoel.blogspot.com/2010/07/violencia-contra-as-mulheres-e-
diaria.html) [pt]:

> “Quando surgem casos, principalmente com pessoas famosas, que chegam aos
> jornais, é que a sociedade efetivamente se dá conta de que aquilo acontece
> cotidianamente e não sai nos jornais. As mulheres são violentadas, são
> subjugadas cotidianamente pela desigualdade”, afirmou ao ministra.

When there are cases, mainly related to famous people that make it to the
news, society realizes what happens on a daily basis and does not get in the
newspapers. Women are rapped, subjugated daily though inequality.

Aware of this, women's groups, such as _[Pão e
Rosas](http://nucleopaoerosas.blogspot.com/2010/07/basta-de-violencia-contra-
as-mulheres.html) _[Bread and Roses, pt], ask how many more such cases have to
happen and call on all oppressed women to organize themselves in schools,
neighborhoods and workplaces.

> Devemos exigir abrigos para as mulheres vítimas de violência e para seus
> filhos e filhas subsidiados pelo Estado, mas sob controle das próprias
> vítimas de violência, das organizações e comissões de mulheres independentes
> do Estado, da patronal, da polícia e da Igreja.

We must demand shelters for women victims of violence and for their sons and
daughters, subsidized by the state, but under control of the victims of
violence themselves, of the organizations and commissions of women independent
from the state, from unions, from the police and from the church.

Cases of violence against women in Brazil are anything but uniform **.**[If on
one hand 50 districts surpass 10 killings per 100.000 inhabitants, more than
half of Brazilian cities didn't register any murders. When comparing Brazilian
states, the discrepancies are equally
surprising](http://blog.controversia.com.br/2010/07/12/dez-mulheres-so-mortas-
por-dia-no-pas/) **[:](http://blog.controversia.com.br/2010/07/12/dez-
mulheres-so-mortas-por-dia-no-pas/)**

> Espírito Santo, o primeiro lugar no ranking, tem índices de 10,3
> assassinatos de mulheres por 100 mil habitantes. No Maranhão é de 1,9 por
> 100 mil. “Os resultados mostram que a concentração de homicídios no Brasil é

Espírito Santo, first place in the ranking, has levels of 10,3 murders of
women for each 100.000 inhabitants. In Maranhão is 1,9 for 100.000. “The
results show the concentration of killings in Brazil to be heterogenous. It is
hard to find a pattern that gives an explanation of the causes” says
researcher Julio Jacobo Wiaselfisz, author of the study.

In the last 10 years, [over 41.000 women from all social classes aged between
18 and 30 years old were killed, often witnessed by their children who are
also often victims of violence
too](http://lacasaenelaire.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/violencia-de-genero-uma-
mulher-e-assassinada-a-cada-duas-horas-no-brasil/) [pt]. Lack of support
services for women in risk situations is pointed as one of causes of impunity
for attackers in spite of the
_[Maria_da_Penha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_Maria_da_Penha) _law passed
in 2006, which granted women protection after a complaint and assured them
that attackers would be punished.
[However](http://blog.controversia.com.br/2010/07/12/dez-mulheres-so-mortas-
por-dia-no-pas/) [pt],

> a nova lei não impediu o assassinato da cabeleireira Maria Islaine de
> Morais, morta em janeiro diante das câmeras pelo ex-marido, alvo de oito
> denúncias. Nem uma série de outros casos que todos os dias ganham as
> manchetes dos jornais.

the new law didn't prevent the murder of hairdresser Maria Islaine de Morais,
killed in January in front of the cameras by her ex-husband, against who she
had filed 8 complaints.

In fact, [most victims are murdered by relatives, husbands, boyfriends or
other man that they may have
rejected](http://deolhos.blogspot.com/2010/07/violencia-cada-2-horas-uma-
mulher-e.html) [pt].

> São casos como negativas de fazer sexo ou de manter a relação. Em 50% das
> ocorrências, o motivo foi qualificado como fútil, como casos de discussões
> domésticas. Houve 10% de mortes por motivos passionais, ligados a ciúmes,
> por exemplo, e 10% relacionado ao uso ou à venda de drogas.

Saying no to sex or wanting to break up the relationship make these cases. In
50% of them the motive was qualified as futile, such as cases resulting from
domestic arguments. 10% are passional crimes, related to jealousy, for
example, and 10% are related to using or selling drugs.

The roots of the violence [are
denounced](http://machiparo.blogspot.com/2010/07/violencia-contra-mulher.html)
[pt] as inherent to the misogyny that characterizes Brazilian culture:

> Essas novelas de violência contra a mulher estão tirando do baú toda a
> brutalidade contra a mulher brasileira. Expôs as vísceras dessa cultura
> brasileira tão machista; colocou do avesso o iceberg de uma realidade que
> costumamos empurrar para debaixo do tapete. Os números dessa violência são
> tão grande que nos assustam e nos levam a pergunta, se essas ações são de
> seres humanos!

These soap operas of violence against women are revealing all the brutality
against the Brazilian woman. The insides of Brazilian misogynistic culture are
exposed; the iceberg of a reality we hide underneath the rug has been turned.
The violence numbers are so high that we are scared and ask if such actions
are done by human beings!

For blogger [Flávia D.](http://meninapapel.blogspot.com/2010/07/eu-ouvi-todo-
o-tipo-de-comentario.html) [pt] women are also themselves part of the problem.
They often accept and incorporate the role of women in society as subjugated
to men, and are frequently the first ones pointing the finger at women that
behave in a manner they consider to be inappropriate, minimizing the
perpetrator's action even if unconsciously. For the
[Barbarelas](http://barbarelas13.blogspot.com/2010/07/ponto-final-na-
violencia-contra.html) [pt], a blog dedicated to fighting against all
violence, it is necessary to unite society in order to put an end to all the
violence inflicted on women.

> A violência contra mulheres e meninas é algo intolerável, inaceitável, fere

Violence against women and girls is intolerable, unacceptable, hurts
humanity's consciousness, it is a violation of human rights. It affects
health, decreases the age expectancy and women's quality of life. Brazil, as a
signer of international documents on the rights of women, and having a
national legislation to comply with, cannot stay silent and omissive. We
expect each authority to act. And that society, the movements of women and men
for gender equality, protest against this manifestations of cultural
backwardness, of misogyny and omission.

Women needing help in Brazil can call free 180 to denounce any violence
against them or any neglect from authorities regarding their complaints and
cases. The information was extracted from blog _[Contra
Machismo](http://contramachismo.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/violencia-contra-as-
mulheres-e-diaria/) who reminds readers on its post title that in Brazil
violence against women still happens on a daily basis._
