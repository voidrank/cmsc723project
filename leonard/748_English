As a country of great geographical importance and an ally to US in its war
against terrorism; Pakistan has a huge crisis at hand. The country is deemed
as a nuclear power but it is currently facing an immense power and energy
shortage. With a daily eight to ten hour of country wide power outage routine,
both business and personal life of Pakistanis are hampered. _Mumtaz A.
Piracha_ , in his [blog
post](http://pakistanviewsonline.blogspot.com/2010/04/renewable-energy-to-
tackle-pakistans.html) puts it quite aptly:

> “In June 2007, the power cuts in Pakistan lasted no more than 3 or 4 hours a
> day. Today, in extremely hot weather, Pakistanis have to endure without
> electricity for 8 to 10 hours a day. Industrial production is suffering,
> exports are down, jobs are being lost, and the national economy is in a
> downward spiral. By all indications, the power crisis in Pakistan is getting
> worse than ever.”

Karachi city, which is Pakistan’s biggest financial and industrial hub, is
facing a deficit of approximately 700 MW against a fair demand of total
2200MW. The present situation continues to cause a huge industrial loss and
adding nuisance to an already troubled economy. _Riaz Haq_ , a Pakistani
blogger, looks at the rising energy demand very critically and shares vital
information with his [blog](http://www.riazhaq.com/2008/01/pakistans-energy-
crisis.html) readers:

> “At an Asia Program event organized by Wilson Center in 2006, _Vladislav
> Vucetic_ of the World Bank provided a troubling assessment of the state of
> Pakistan’s electricity sector—demand is approaching maximum production
> capacity, while institutional capacity for policy development and
> implementation remains low. Worse, failing to resolve these problems may
> cause investment delays and hamper Pakistan’s economic growth.”

It’s not the economy that’s singly paying for the incompetence and corruption
of previous and present Governments. In fact the everyday life of an average
Pakistani has come to a standstill. In a [blog
post](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/21/92627/as-power-shortages-spread-
pakistan.html) _Saeed Shah_ narrates the story of a working Pakistani woman:

> “Children can't do their homework. Household work doesn't get done, as
> washing machines and other appliances cannot work. When you go home from
> work, you have no idea whether there will be electricity at home. Your whole
> life is disturbed,” said Mahnaz Peracha of the Network for Consumer
> Protection, an independent Pakistani advocacy group.”

Energy crisis of such magnitude doesn’t come about one fine day. Question
arises what led to all this? For more than a decade [KalaBagh Dam
Controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabagh_Dam) has annoyed the nation
like an old gramophone. Pakistan, since its very creation, fixated on
hydropower as its only technique of power generation. Minus the politics,
KalaBagh Dam was a brilliant project and could have supported the national
need for years to come. _Tahir Hameed_ pens down the lack of national
consensus on Kalabagh Dam issue in his
[post](http://www.pakspectator.com/dams-and-pakistan/):

> “The inability of provinces and governments to resolve the Kalabagh Dam
> issue speaks volumes about our acumen and wisdom especially when
> International bodies point out that the building of Kalabagh dam will save
> the country from becoming a barren desert.”

In the current scenario Government, power producers and distributors are all
trapped in a circular debt, which has administratively damaged the already
worsen situation. Riaz Haq [writes](http://www.riazhaq.com/2010/02/pakistans-
circular-debt-and-load.html):

> The key players in this “circular debt” trap are the federal and provincial
> governments as the biggest deadbeats, the power distributors like

Work around like Rental Power Plants (RPPs) is look down upon by the Pakistani
people, blogger from [My Land
Pakistan](http://mylandpakistan.blogspot.com/2010/01/solution-is-problem-
itself.html) shares similar sentiments:

> “The whole drama of load shedding is being played to create the importance
> of RPPs (RENTAL POWER PLANTS) among the people. There has been great
> criticism on the government from the media and public on the issue of RPPs”

Is there an alternate solution, if we don’t go with RPPs?

[Saeed Qureshi](http://saeedqureshi42.blogspot.com/2010/03/pakistans-energy-
crisis-and-irans-offer.html) enlightens us with his upright opinion:

> “Iran has offered Pakistan up to 2270 MG way back in 2008 to beef up the
> indigenous power production and to offset the shortage that has brewed up an
> unremitting social and economic chaos. And when Iran is bending over
> backward and frantically trying to help Pakistan overcome its chronic energy

While the authorities employ their power shedding experiments on the nation,
Pakistani public helplessly endures the menace for the time being. But from
the deteriorating condition at hand one cannot disregard the possibility of a
violent outburst from the seemingly patient majority.
