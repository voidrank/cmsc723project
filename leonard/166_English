For seven consecutive days, thousands of residents of Male, the capital of
Maldives, have
[protested](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1999605.ece) on
busy streets and public spaces, expressing their dissatisfaction over soaring
prices of consumer goods and economic mismanagement of the government. The
protests are being organized by the opposition parties, even though they have
labeled it as a youth-led protest.

While there is a genuine dissatisfaction over the government’s mismanagement
of the economy, not all residents are joining the protests, because of the
highly political nature of the protests and the extent of violence involved. A
number of people, including police and journalists, have been hurt during the
protests. According to reports more than 300 people have been arrested so far,
a figure, which has been disputed by the government.

The government has tried to play down the significance of the protests,
blaming the opposition for trying to destabilize the first democratically
elected government of the Maldives and trying to topple the government before
the next presidential election scheduled for 2013. The government has not
acknowledged that there has been a considerable increase of prices of goods
following a recent devaluation of the local currency against US dollar.

Bloggers and tweeps react to the crisis in the Maldives:

_Nina Ali_ [reacts](http://twitter.com/#!/mninaali/status/66178147720241153)
to a statement by the President that prices have not soared and one tin of
powder milk is sufficient for two children for one month:

> how big do they think one tin of powder milk is.. : ONE BARREL????

_Sofwath_ [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/sofwath/status/65705251365326848)
about the rising cost of living:

> Those who don't have to pay everything they earn for rent would never
> understand. They can joke and laugh but the reality is very different.

Tweeps find it ironic the government is trying to restrict the protests while
the current leaders staged a number of protests when they were in the
opposition. _Rizwee_
[tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/rizwee/status/65239581351608321):

> Current Maldivian regime doesn’t have heart to see anti-government protests.
> They forgot how they protested in the past regime.

_Epicloser_ [makes
fun](http://twitter.com/#!/epicloser/status/66484408852549632) of a pro-
government protest held on Friday against the other protests:

> Pro gov protests ended and prices went down instantly. Everythings solved.

_Epicloser_ also

violence involved in the protests:

instability:

_Badruddeen_
[believes](http://twitter.com/#!/Badruddeen/status/65260944653172736) violence
is not the solution:

> @[sujauu](http://twitter.com/sujauu) totally agree with you on this.
> Everyone should avoid violence at any cost. Violence is not the way forward.

Not everyone is willing to take part in the protests even though they are not
happy with how the government is handling the economy. _Sofwath_
[tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/sofwath/status/66339037547470848):

_Gaanagaa_ [pokes

protests which has been labeled as youth-led but organized by opposition:

> Elders protesting for youth's right for cheaper iPads and Thai food.
> Meanwhile, youth busy watching soccer on elder's TVs.

_Badruddeen_ feels the protests are staged by the opposition [to overthrow the
government](http://twitter.com/#!/Badruddeen/status/64613836325519360):

> @[epicloser](http://twitter.com/epicloser) lol revolution to reduce the

As the price increase began after the government devalued the local currency
against the dollar, P3est

The protests have been going on mainly during the night and some residents are
feeling the toll of sleepless nights. _profEuLOGist_

_Hassan Ziyau_ reacts to profEuLOGist’s tweet and
[elaborates](http://www.hassanziyau.com/2011/05/downside-of-protest.html) the
downside of the protests:

> Freedom to protest through peaceful means is without question a given right
> by the constitution to its people. However in practicing one’s rights, the
> rights of the others should not be violated. Referring to the above
> mentioned tweet, I am in full agreement with its idea, that the protest if
> need to be held should be held during daylight and in a place which can
> accompany large amounts of people, such as the republic square rather than
> the small crowded streets and lanes of the capital.

Some mainstream media outlets and even some protesters have drawn parallels
between the Arab revolutions and the current protests in the Maldives.
However, the government officials point out that the government is
democratically elected while the opposition’s roots are with the 30-year-old
dictatorship that ended with the election of 2008.

Blogger _Thakurubey_ summarizes the [different perspectives on the
protest](http://thakurubey.blogspot.com/2011/05/protest-or-public-
disorder.html):

> the protest that has been going in the street of Male for 5 consecutive
> nights is viewed in differently. supporters of the government view it as a
> plot organized by the opposition to overthrow the government by means of
> protest. taking a model of recent protest that led to government change in
> most of the middle east nations. The ruling party vows to defend the
> government by all means. the opposition and its supporters say it is protest
> by the youth to highlight the impact the country is facing due to the dollar
> reference change made by the government to stabilize the economy.

_Hassan Abdullah_ [writes](http://www.lycoze.com/2011/05/protesters-and-
government-both-need-to.html) about the need for both the government and the
opposition to act responsibly and put the nation first:

> So I request those who are not happy with the current regime to criticize
> the government make them held accountable and voice out against them or even
> protest against them, but save your own account in-terms of truth and
> justice. And I request the government, especially president Nasheed, not to
> make false promises and to STOP showing illusion and to do whatever you can
> to save the nation from crisis.
>
> My final request to my dear brothers and sisters as someone who do not have
> any knowledge like the rest; “please do not set your focus on today or
> tomorrow, set it far beyond that.”
