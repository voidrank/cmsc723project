Cambodia's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications has issued a circular
banning internet cafes within 500 meters of schools or educational buildings.
The circular also prohibits internet cafes from welcoming young people under
the age of 18, pointing that internet poses numerous dangers such as
terrorism, economic crimes and the distribution of pornography, [as the
Cambodia Daily newspaper
reported](http://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/government-order-may-close-many-
of-citys-internet-cafes-6660/).

This circular came a few months after the government enforced a [previous
circular](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/09/cambodia-mandatory-
internet-surveillance-cameras/) that required internet cafes to set up
surveillance cameras and register callers.

This has raised a lot of eyebrows among Cambodian bloggers. Tharum Bun wrote
on the [VOA blog](http://blogs.voanews.com/khmer-
english/musings/2012/12/18/internet-cafe-ban-worries-bloggers/)that the new
government would eventually eliminate Phnom Penh cyber cafes altogether.

The [circular](http://licadho-cambodia.org/press/files/MoPT-
Circular1815-InternetCafe.pdf) also mentions in a vaguely worded document that
people should stop playing internet games.

[Tep Sovichet](https://sovichetlife.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/no-internet-
cafe/), a 17-year-old blogger and student in Phnom Penh, thinks that the ban
cannot stop students from dropping off classes and playing games at cyber
cafes. He all but supports the circular.

> Not all the cyber cafes are places where students play internet games, and
> online crimes aren't usually conducted from cyber cafes. Not all students go
> to internet cafes for games, but it can be for various purposes […] such as
> doing assignments, learning new things and geting news from all kinds of
> sources.

According to the circular, internet cafe owners throughout the country are
being asked to sign the contract with the Ministry.

[Khmerbird](http://khmerbird.com/news/internet-cafes-closed-cambodia.html ),
another Cambodian blogger, wrote in his blog:

> I totally support the ideas behind this circular. But I think to restrict

> internet cafe in Phnom Penh center would be closed.

According to the circular, if an internet cafe is caught within the red zone
or if the crime is committed on the premises, “the shop would be closed, all
the equipment would be confiscated, and owners would face arrest and be sent
to court.”

hopes-we-just-wont-notice-ridiculous-internet-cafe-circular/), an avid blogger
and freelance journalist based in Southeast Asia wrote on her
[blog](http://fainegreenwood.com/2012/12/18/cambodian-government-hopes-we-
just-wont-notice-ridiculous-internet-cafe-circular/) about the ban of the
internet cafes on December 18:

> Sure, it’s unclear exactly how much power a “circular” actually has to

> the fact it’s floating around at all is a disturbing indication that the

[Urban Voice Cambodia](http://www.urbanvoicecambodia.net/), a crowd-mapping
project for Phnom Penh, has started its campaign against the ban by asking
people to add their local internet cafes to their website “[Submit
Report](https://www.urbanvoicecambodia.net/reports/submit).” By its own
calculation, almost all the Internet cafes in Phnom Penh would be closed.

Human rights group [Licadho](http://licadho-
cambodia.org/pressrelease.php?perm=298) also opposed the circular:

> This heavy-handed effort to shut down affordable and accessible venues for
> using the Internet in Cambodia is not only legally unfounded, it is a
> transparent attempt to block part of the population’s access to independent
> sources of information through news sites and social media
