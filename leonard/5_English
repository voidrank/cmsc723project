Popular K-pop music videos often show beautiful women kissing each other, and
South Korean soap operas many times feature adorable gay couples. But is South
Korea really as accepting of homosexuality as it appears to be on screen?

After [Hong Suk-chun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Seok-cheon ), the
first openly gay actor in South Korea, [discussed
](http://ph.omg.yahoo.com/news/hong-seok-cheon-shares-about-the-struggles-
of-074516151.html )[in a lengthy talk show](http://ph.omg.yahoo.com/news/hong-
seok-cheon-shares-about-the-struggles-of-074516151.html ) the struggles he has
faced since coming out as a gay man in 2000, many online reflected on the
country's changing attitudes toward homosexuality.

Hong, who was fired from almost all of the shows he appeared on after coming
out of the closet, has since made a comeback, currently appearing on numerous
TV programs.

Twitter user [@ShrimpChung](https://twitter.com/ShrimpChung) [ko] lamented
that there are still straight men who fear gay men being attracted to them,
which rarely happens in real life:

[@ShrimpChung:](https://twitter.com/ShrimpChung/status/298622441629024257) I
drank tea with my colleagues and the main subject of our conversation was Hong
Suk-chun from last night's Healing Camp. Most of them showed empathy toward
him, while some said the thought of gay men liking them gives them the creeps.

change comes at slow pace:

[@_krpapa:](https://twitter.com/_krpapa/status/298628782154211328) Hong Suk-
chun tried very hard to change people's preconceived notions about sexual
minorities. But things haven't changed much in reality.

[@Reservoir_fox_](https://twitter.com/Reservoir_fox_) [ko] pointed out that
the talk show, with Hong as a guest, touched on no other issues than the so-
called “gay subject”:

What's funny about Korean broadcast is that having Hong Suk-chun as a guest,
all the conversations revolved around homosexuality issues from the very start
to the end.

Although gay characters often appear in Korean movies and soap operas, some
social media users raised questions about how homosexuals are being ‘consumed’
in the cultural context, arguing that there is no real gay in any of those
products. [@emotionalboy83](https://twitter.com/emotionalboy83) [ko] wrote:

It is uncomfortable to watch homosexuality being used commercially without
respect for these people. There is a ‘gay code’ (or gay context) in the
culture but no actual gays and there is no lesbian in lesbian cultural
contents.

User [@niefou](https://twitter.com/niefou) [ko] blamed the media for
distorting the image of homosexuals:

[@niefou:](https://twitter.com/niefou/status/295060450066980864) All
homosexuals on TV and in novels appear as a kind of lost child – miserable, in
despair, and suffering from family issues. How we ‘consume’ homosexuality is
actually based on a negative stereotype of gays, which claims that they are
actually different from us, the heterosexuals.

Young South Koreans, however, seem much more accepting of homosexuality than
previous generations, enough to joke about it in a harmless way. Lee Seung-
hwan in PPSS blog [analyzed](http://ppss.kr/archives/4429) [ko] the attention

And he [continued](http://ppss.kr/archives/4429) [ko]:
