![kiss-208-2b](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2010/01/kiss-208-2b.jpg)Perhaps the most buzzing topic in the
Georgian social media scene was not politics, elections, sport, crisis,
earthquakes or catastrophe. Instead, one of the most discussed topics was
actually about a new television show, _Ghame Shorenastan_. Shown on _Imedi_
TV, the title translates as _Night with Shorena_ and covers topics about sex.

As the first to do so, and with former Georgian _Playboy_ Playmate Shorena
Begashvili, the show received a lot of feedback online, both positive and
negative. _NightGravity_ was [certainly
delighted](http://nightgravity.blogspot.com/2009/12/blog-post_19.html).

This show will work. I'm sure a lot of famous, not so famous and also
conservative people watched it.

Everybody agreed that Georgia needs a television programme about sex and most
of the negative comments, [such as this
criticism](http://lukrenc.wordpress.com/2009/12/19/%E1%83%99%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%9E%E1%83%98-%E1%83%95%E1%83%AD%E1%83%90%E1%83%9B%E1%83%9D%E1%83%97%E2%80%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%9C%E1%83%A3-%E1%83%A6%E1%83%90%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94-%E1%83%A8%E1%83%9D/)
by _lukrenc_ , were of a more technical nature.

The show has an indisputably interesting and sexy hostess – Shorena Begashvili
– but the show itself is not so much – I thought I was listening to “Top 10
music videos”.

Popular Georgian blogger _Tomushka_ made several posts about the show and
reviewed every episode. She also [criticized the technical
aspect](http://tomushka.blogspot.com/2009/12/2.html).

Lishtota even [conducted an online
poll](http://lishtota.wordpress.com/2009/12/19/shorena/) asking “When will
“night with Shorena” be cancelled?”

![poll](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/poll.JPG)

[1. One month or earlier (40%); 2. Several months (28%); It won't be cancelled
(31%)]

Another blogger, _Giorgi Benashvili_ was [surprised that people did not react
strongly against the
show](http://giorgibenashvili.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/sexylessons/),
especially as the authors and producers expected a scandal.

In fact, the lack of adverse reactions lead many to suppose that society, or
at least that part of it online, was ready for such a show. Many posts on
blogs and forums even complain that the show was not informative enough, as
[one comment complains](http://tomushka.blogspot.com/2009/12/blog-
post_19.html#c7520752398030857619).

> გოგო კარგია უდაოდ. ყველაფერი ისე იყო როგორც ჩვენს ცხოვრებაში, გამომწვევი
> ფასადით შეფუთული ფრიგიდულობა. სექსი დარჩა ოცნებად :D :D

The girl is nice for sure. Everything [ _the show – D._ ] was like our life –
frigidity wrapped in an extravagant cover. Sex remained as a dream :D :D

Perhaps the television show had hoped to make a sexual revolution, but failed
because Georgia has already managed to escape from the mentality of there
being “no sex in the USSR.” This topic is not taboo anymore and maybe a sexual
revolution has already happened, albeit a velvet one.
