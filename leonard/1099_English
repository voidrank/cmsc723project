Two deadly storms struck Philippines in the last two weeks killing more than
[500
people](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091010-229370/Landslide-
deaths-lift-storm-toll-past-540). [The first
storm](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/28/philippines-flooding-
documented-on-citizen-videos/) triggered the [worst
flooding](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/27/philippines-worst-
flooding-in-40-years/) in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. The flooding
disaster affected more than [3 million
individuals](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/02/typhoon-ketsana-
batters-southeast-asia/). [The second storm
tragedy](http://www.gmanews.tv/story/174355/40-landslides-in-the-cordillera-
claim-over-250-lives) unleashed massive
[landslides](http://pinoyweekly.org/new/photos-cordillera-after-pepeng/) in
the northern part of the Philippines. It also forced several dams to release
large amounts of water which caused [unprecedented
flooding](http://www.gmanews.tv/story/174257/trapped-pangasinan-residents-
look-to-sky-for-help) in several provinces in the north.

Aside from [using the internet to
help](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/28/philippines-helping-flood-
victims-through-social-media/) flood victims, Filipino netizens are sharing
their thoughts on the relationship of the recent natural calamities and the
reality of climate change.

_edveecruz Blog_ emphasizes that [climate change is a real
problem](http://edveecruz.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/politics-in-the-midst-of-
typhoons/) in the country today

> 1) climate change is a real problem that affects all of us and is critical
> in the short and long run, as we’ve just witnessed; 2) clogging our rivers
> and canals with waste products that aggravate flooding is our own doing and
> NOT an act of God; 3) denuding our forests causes mud-slides that causes
> death as we’ve experienced once again…and again…and again;

_Kiko Matching_ identifies some of the [reforms the government should
implement](http://kikomatching.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/after-ondoy-here-
comes-pepeng/) to minimize the impact of climate change

> Now it is imminent, the effects of Climate change is already affecting
> people’s daily lives… the Government should impose stricter policies to help
> prevent continued denudation of the forests, initiate better garbage
> collection and disposal thru the local governments as well as have mass
> cleaning and re-forestation projects. The government should be busy on
> helping the nation instead of being more of a liability as what many
> Filipinos perceived them to be.

_goIloilo.com_ fears that several cities in the country would be
[uninhabitable](http://goiloilo.com/typhoons-ondoy-ketsana-pepeng-parma-
iloilo/) because of climate change

> I’m afraid that this may be a permanent and ever-worsening affect of climate
> change which may make large parts of the Philippines uninhabitable. Low-
> lying river front cities such as Manila and Iloilo (and many others) may be
> especially hard hit.

Because of the twin flooding disasters, _Better Philippines_ notes that there
is an [increased public
awareness](http://www.betterphilippines.com/environment/ondoy/) about the
dangers of global warming:

> If there’s one good thing to come out of the ordeal caused by tropical storm
> Ondoy it would probably be an increase in awareness among Filipinos of the
> dangers of climate change and global warming. It would really be such a
> shame if in spite of what has already happened Filipinos would continue to
> be ignorant or worse unmindful of the fact that the environment is changing.
>
> It should be clear by now that a lot of adjustments have to be made not only
> by the government but by ordinary citizens as well to ensure that a similar
> calamity of this magnitude would not happen again.

_Embrace life_ observes that many people are now beginning to understand the
need to [prepare for weather disasters](http://glimpse-
neaquino.blogspot.com/2009/10/after-ondoy-comes-what.html):

> In life, there is always a lesson learned after the storm. Now, the people
> are monitoring the weather condition. Some evacuated already in a higher
> grounds…We can not prevent natural calamities but we can do something to
> survive. Brace for stronger and heavy rainfall in the future due to climate
> change but let us all prepare ourselves to face such emergency.

_Control Yourself_ [echoes](http://kayechichas.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/ism-
and-typhoon-ondoy-relief/) a similar point:

> This isn’t just about the need for relief, this is also about climate
> change…The past few days have been really eye-opening for me. In the end,
> it’s not about whether or not these disasters happen. It’s about doing
> something to prevent them from happening, or at least slowing down the
> inevitable.

_Slingshot Journals_ appeals for an [efficient use of disaster
funds](http://slingshot2004.blogspot.com/2009/10/wrath-of-ondoy.html):

> The wrath of Ondoy is a message (a big, hurtful, devastating message) that
> we Filipinos should take into heart. It is a message to our leaders: that
> climate change and environmental protection is now and will be the most
> pressing concern in the near future; that budgets meant for disasters and
> MEANT to be spent in disasters; that they should moderate their greed and
> spend the people's money in matters of their welfare and safety.
>
> It is also a message to our countrymen: that it is about time that we change
> our current ways of life and give a little to preserve nature; that we as
> Filipinos start to unite and be as one family in helping each other and be
> with one another.

_Bloggers Kapihan_ is
[participating](http://www.bloggerskapihan.com/2009/10/08/blog-action-
day-2009-pilipinas/) in the October 15 Blog Action Day on climate change

> We cannot be apathetic or cynical. We as a people have the solemn duty to
> accept the reality of climate change, to study it, and to take a stand.
>
> Bloggers Kapihan thus calls on Filipino bloggers to take time out on Oct. 15
> to post your thoughts and aspirations, frustrations and hopes, photos,
> videos and stories, on climate change and how it affects our family,
> community, country and the globe, and how we wish to make things better
