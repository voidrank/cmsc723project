Like all GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) member states, Bahrain depends greatly
on foreign workforce especially from South Asian countries in both high and
low level jobs. According to the Bahrain 2010 census, the expat community
makes a slight majority with 51 per cent of Bahrain's 1.2 million strong
population.

During Bahrain's recent protests and unrest, the expatriate community grew
very concerned about their safety as reports of Pakistanis having been
[attacked](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/17/the-plights-of-pakistani-
workers-in-bahrain-protests/) in their homes in the capital Manama.

::D::, a journalist and blogger of Indian background who has spent most of her
life in Bahrain, writes about her
[thoughts](http://dilraz.blogspot.com/2011/03/bahrain-my-part-to-play.html) on
the ongoing unrest in Bahrain:

> Many expats in Bahrain, like me, have been born and brought up on this

Many in the expatriate community are supportive of Bahrain's government as
Bahrain prides itself as being a relatively liberal country that gives freedom
to worship to all faiths and religions.

> A lot of expatriates also came out in public in support of the Royal family.
> Many reacted when expatriates stepped out in favour of the government here,

> I have but only one question, “Would you stand back and watch when your
> house, your country is getting hurt? Would you say it’s not my
> responsibility and stay away?” When our country is in crisis, it is our
> right and duty to step forward.

She also points out the developments in Bahrain's media towards the expatriate
community.

> The media has taken massive strides. We even have a desi private owned
> station here now. We have multiple newspapers in Arabic and English. Bahrain
> also prints Tagalog, Malayalam and Urdu newspapers here. Over the last
> month, state run BTV has struggled to keep us as updated as possible [though
> it might lean towards the government]. Yes, the media has come a long way
> but it still has miles to go. This week for the first time in history, BTV
> showed news bulletins in Tagalog and Hindi.
>
> That in itself is a mark of respect and appreciation to the expatriate
> community.

She ends her post confident that the government will do their best to keep the
expat community safe during these difficult times

> For me and my family, the question of leaving does not cross our minds. This
> is where I was born, where my family had lived for almost thirty years, our
> home. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Bahrain have also assured
> that they will do the best to keep us safe. I trust them and I trust
> Bahrain.
