Damp and marshy, they seem boring and barren. But contrary to their
appearance, [tidal flats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflat "Wikipedia:
Tidal Flat/Mudflat") or coastal wetlands are rich in biodiversity and help
maintain balance in the [water cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle
"Wikipedia: Water Cycle"). For Japan, which hosts [46 of the 2,098 registered
wetlands worldwide](http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/sitelist.pdf "Link to PDF
document: Ramsar Site List") [pdf], their conservation is essential.

Concern for Japanese precious wetlands is international, with Japan belonging
to the [Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance](http://www.ramsar.org) treaty, better known as “[the Ramsar
Convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsar_Convention "Wikipedia:Ramsar
Convention")“, which promotes conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.

But community organizations in Japan down on the ground and deep in the mud
are the ones who have led the fight in recent years to protect these valuable
ecosystems from the encroaching threat of land development and pollution.

The [Save Wajiro Tidal Flat Association](http://www14.ocn.ne.jp/~hamasigi/)
[ja], based in Fukuoka city, has fought an uphill battle for more than two
decades to [preserve the
resources](http://kyushu.com/gleaner/issue44/feature.shtml) of their hometown,
the site of the [Wajiro Tidal Flat](http://worddomination.com/wajiro.html).

The [Wajiro Tidal Flat](http://worddomination.com/wajiro.html), located in the
closed-off section of Hakata Bay, is the largest tidal flat in the Sea of
​​Japan. The flat is also an important stopover and wintering ground for
migratory birds.

The landscape of the once tranquil tidal flat in Hakata Bay began to rapidly
change around 1994 with the construction of an [artificial
island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_City,_Fukuoka). Although Japan's
bubble economy was bursting at that time, public officials made development a
priority despite doubts over the environmental assessment of the project.

The resulting change in [tidal
stream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_stream) has deteriorated the water
cycle, with a part of the flat corrupted by
[algae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulva_lactuca).

The tidal flat was selected by Japan's Ministry of Environment as a candidate
for designation as a [Ramsar Wetland of International
Importance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ramsar_wetlands_of_international_importance)
in 2004, but designation was never made official.

> 波静かな和白干潟は，子供たちを水で遊ばせ，人々を恵みの海産物でうるおします。四季を通じて魚貝類，エビやタコ，のり等の食物で人々の命を救い，干潟や浅海域の生物たちの営みで海水を浄化してきました。稚魚や稚貝を育て，和白干潟は生き物だちの命のゆりかごだったのです。

> 私の命一心も体もこの和白干潟を通して育まれました。自然の美しさや雄大さ，そして厳しさは，感性を豊かにします。和白干潟の自然とのかかわりは，私を創作活動へと導いていきました。大人になった今も，和白干潟は心の安らぎを与えてくれます。

Continuing with its efforts, the Save Wajiro Tidal Flat Organization conducts
water and sand quality studies every month and organizes popular seashore
cleanup events for local residents. Local elementary school students are
invited regularly to observe the tidal flat to supplement their lessons.

E.I., who helped oversee the elementary school students,
[wrote](http://wajiroblog.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-53.html) [ja] on the Save
Wajiro Tidal Flat Association's blog about how the organization piqued the
children's curiosities about the wetland:

>
> 今日観察した鳥や、植物、貝殻、海藻の紹介の後、子どもたちから拾った鳥の羽の種類の質問や、アシ原になぜカニの巣穴があるの？などの質問が出されました。拾ったピンクや黄色の小さな貝殻は名前がわからないものもあり、守る会の宿題になりましたが、後で調べたら｢ユウシオガイ｣というそうです。和白小学校4年生の子どもたちの和白干潟での観察会はこれで終わりですが、2月末には学校で1年間の観察会の発表会があります。私たち守る会も毎年学校に出かけ、発表を楽しみにしています。

> After our staff explained about birds, shells and seaweeds that children
> observed by themselves today, the students asked questions such as the type
> of bird feathers they found or why crab burrow is in reed bed. Some small
> yellow and pink shells found by the students couldn't be identified. It

In 2011, the Ramsar Convention celebrated its 40th anniversary. Reflecting on
the years gone by, [Japan Wetlands Action
Network](http://www.jawan.jp/old/jawan/index.html) advisor Satoshi Kobayashi
[mused](http://www.jawan.jp/rept/rp2012-j101/01.html) [ja] on JAWAN REPORT
about how Japan's long-held belief that it could master nature might finally
begin to change. The [Japan Wetlands Action
Network](http://www.jawan.jp/old/jawan/index.html) has fought to conserve
wetlands on a national and international scale since 1991:

>
> これまで比較的長い間、日本人は高度な技術を制御し、自然を制御しようとしてきた。そしてそれらは制御できるものと思い込んできた。しかしながら、2011年、その思い込みは逆襲される。技術は時に制御できずに悲劇を生むことがあり、自然もまた制御できない側面を持っていることを思い知らされた。  
>
> ここで日本人が踏みとどまり、エネルギー政策、国土計画、公共事業の在り方を軌道修正していくことが出来れば、そして世界にモデルを示すことが出来れば、日本人は行動によって世界を変えていくことが出来るのではないか。

> For a relatively long time until now, the Japanese have been trying to
> control nature by using advanced technologies. We have been clinging to the
> idea that we could do that. But, in 2011, that assumption was smashed. We
> realized that technology could go out of control and incidentally, could
> produce a tragedy. Also we realized that nature, too, could go beyond anyone
> can handle.  
>  If we pause and think, if we shift to make bold initiatives of change for
> energy policy, national planning and public works, if we demonstrate a role
> model by doing so, we could change the world by taking such action.

A year later, the organization attended the [Ramsar Conference of the
Contracting Parties](http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-about-bodies-
conf/main/ramsar/1-36-71-72_4000_0__) (COP11) in Bucharest, Romania. After
participating in the conference, Mr. Kobayashi
[explained](http://www.jawan.jp/rept/rp2012/01.html) [ja] that now is not the
time for conservationists to pat themselves on the back. Progress in tidal
flat preservation is a matter of perspective:

>
> 会議の運用規則等事務的な手続きが進む中、午前中の最後には条約の科学技術検討委員会（STRP)の議長ヘザー女史からの報告がありました。前回COP10に末娘8歳を連れて参加していたということで、最初にCOP10会議場の前で撮影された娘さんの写真を出しました。おかあさんはどんな業務に関わっているのか知ってもらおうと、会議の最後の方で数時間だけ、末娘に会場後ろの方で聴いていてもらったんだそうです。そして、韓国からの帰りの飛行機で会議はどうだったと尋ねると、「湿地保全の大事さは何となくわかったんだけど、私が大人になったらほとんど湿地が残されていないんじゃないかと心配になっちゃった」と娘さんが言ったんだそうです。「なんだか湿地の保全というのは、あまりにもゆっくりとしか進まさそうな調子だったし…」と続けられて、COP10が実り多い会議だったと思っていたヘザーさんは、言い返すことができなかったんだそうだ。子供恐るべしですね。

> While clerical procedures such as operating rules of the meeting progressed,
> Ms. Heather the Chairman of Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP)

> Then, in the flight back from Korea Ms. Heather asked her daughter what she

> Children are sharp, aren’t they?

The Japan Wetlands Action Network promotes a nationwide campaign, [Wetlands,
Tidal Flats Campaign Day](http://www.wwf.or.jp/activities/2007/04/652714.html)
[ja], every spring, organizing a variety of events, such as nature
observation, discussions, and art exhibitions to help raise public awareness
about the conservation of wetland biodiversity. Registration for participating
groups is [now open](http://www.jawan.jp/wdj/2013/notice/campaign.html) [ja].
