The [outbreak](http://repeatingislands.com/2010/10/22/suspected-cholera-
outbreak-in-haiti-kills-142/) has turned into [an
epidemic](http://livesayhaiti.blogspot.com/2010/10/cholera.html), with [the
death toll rising every
day](http://haitirescuecenter.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/cholera-day-10/).
Haiti, already poorly equipped to deal with this level of public health
threat, has been grappling more than usual to contain its spread in [the
aftermath of the January 12
earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/haiti-
earthquake-2010/) – nearly a year later, people are still living in tent
cities.

Adding insult to injury – or, in this case, anger to anguish – have been
[reports claiming that the epidemic was caused by “excrement from Nepalese
peacekeepers.”](http://dyinginhaiti.blogspot.com/2010/10/cholera-and-
capital.html) It is [no secret](http://lo-de-alla.org/2010/09/death-of-youth-
sparks-protests-against-minustah/) that the occupying UN forces, known as
[MINUSTAH](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/), have [a
troubled history in Haiti](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/28/haiti-
security-vs-relief/); bloggers have been quite outspoken on the subject,
[asking whether stabilization is actually a euphemism for
subordination](http://www.haitianalysis.com/2010/11/11/selling-subordination-
as-stabilization).

Against this backdrop, the mere possibility that the cause of the cholera
outbreak could be traced back to MINUSTAH (a claim which the UN denies) is
[proving to be the final
straw](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/18/un_blamed_for_killing_2_haitian).
As the disease spread to the capital, Port-au-Prince, [so have the anti-UN
protests](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11791172).

At the beginning of the week, as the disease claimed close to one thousand
lives, _[Mediahacker](http://www.mediahacker.org/2010/11/anger-erupts-at-un-
in-haiti-as-cholera-toll-nears-1000/)_ republished a report from Inter-Press
Service:

> At least two protesters have been reported killed, one shot in the back, a
> local official told the media. U.N. troops say they acted in self-defence.
>
> Demonstrators erected barricades in the street and pelted troops with stones
> and bottles. Two police stations were set on fire.
>
> Protests were reported in the cities of Hinche and Gonaives in Haiti’s
> cholera-ravaged central region as well.
>
> Demonstrators blame foreign peacekeepers for introducing the infectious
> disease into the country. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and
> Prevention says the strain of cholera bacteria spreading in Haiti matches
> the one endemic in South Asia.
>
> An estimated 200,000 people could be sickened before the epidemic is brought
> under control, an effort that could take up to six months.
>
> The outbreak has killed over 900 people, just two weeks before scheduled
> elections.

The country's pending elections, of course, further complicate an already
complex issue. The UN and the Haitian government are chalking the protests up
to [politically motivated](http://wadnerpierre.blogspot.com/2010/07/haiti-
gears-up-for-polls-again-

disruptions. To counter this claim,
_[HaitiAnalysis.com](http://www.haitianalysis.com/2010/11/17/haiti-s-
elections-cholera-epidemic-president-jean-bertrand-aristide-breaks-the-
silence)_ republishes an interview with exiled former President (and [Fanmi
Lavalas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanmi_Lavalas) leader) Jean Bertrand
Aristide:

> President Aristide first speculated about the origin of the cholera and then
> blamed those who organized the Feb. 29 coup d’état against him. “Concerning
> the cholera incident, if yes or no it was imported – as critiques strongly
> suggested. Before all, those who organized the 2004 coup d’état /kidnapping
> paving the way for the invaders, now accused of being the cause of the
> recent cholera epidemic, must also share the blame,” said former President
> Aristide.

to be a reliable source for updates about the ongoing clashes:

> It was the third day of so-called “cholera riots” against foreign troops
> blamed for introducing the disease into the country.
>
> Someone said the protesters are violent “chimere,” a word for political
> gangs.
>
> As we arrived on the outskirts of Cap Haitien proper, the streets were
> deserted except for people gathered around barricades. One was still
> flaming. At another, dozens of men milled around a burnt out car.
>
> I was glad when an elderly man walking in the street stopped me. He was Amos
> Ordena, the local section’s elected Kazek – an official dispute mediator.
>
> Asked if the protests are by a single group or the general population, he
> said all elements of society are participating in “the movement.” He said
> MINUSTAH are not firing weapons in self-defense, in the air to disperse
> protesters, but firing at people. He heard that at least one person had died
> earlier in the day.
>
> I’m asking everyone I meet here – from local journalists, vendors, men at
> the barricades, to a local magistrate – if these protests were organized by
> a gang or political group.
>
> The unanimous answer is no – people are fed up with UN peacekeepers and the
> cholera outbreak is the straw that broke the camel’s back.
>
> Are protests against the UN meant to destabilize the country? Are Haitians
> who’ve taken to the streets being used, like puppets, by powerful
> politicians for their own ends? Are the protests violent?
>
> The foreigners I’ve talked to say yes. But most Haitians I’ve spoken with
> say no. They say this is the inevitable outcome when troops who operate in
> Haiti with seeming impunity may have introduced a deadly, misery-multiplying
> disease into the country. It’s an angry, popular movement – protesting
> however they can, emotions running high – against a five-year-old foreign
