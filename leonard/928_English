The largest Polish social network, [Nasza-Klasa](http://nasza-klasa.pl/) (‘Our
Class’ – based around the idea of networking with school peers), appeared in
the mainstream media several times last year. In summer 2009 it was featured
as #19 on the [Techcrunch list of main social
networks](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/modeling-the-real-market-value-
of-social-networks/), valued from $90 up to $553 million pending the
measurement metrics. The same summer a resident of Gryfin [won a case against
Nasza-
Klasa](http://www.gk24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090731/ZACHODNIOPOMORSKIE/145632152)

[PL] to ensure that users do not upload photos without appropriate license.
When the social network was celebrating its third birthday in November 2009,
[questions were also
raised](http://infotuba.pl/media/internet/czystki_w_profilach_uzytkownikow_na_nasza-
klasa_pl_a7543.xml) [PL] about censorship and moderation of its user accounts.
The growing scepticism towards the network became apparent when offices,
ministries and the police [banned their employees from using the

Nasza-Klasa logo today

Yesterday, Gazeta.pl daily news portal [posted a short
article](http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80269,7416256,Znikaja_litery_z_logo_naszej_klasy__Moda_na_kradzieze.html)
[PL] informing its readers about a discussion of their portal's users around
Nasza-Klasa logo, with gradually disappearing characters. This redesign,
conducted during the last few days, was positioned as potentially an attempt
of network administrators to allude to [the recent theft of the sign from
Auschwitz Nazi death camp
museum](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/22/poland-arbeit-macht-frei-
sign-stolen-from-auschwitz/). Gazeta.pl in their article clearly stated
quoting of their readers and added that Nasza-Klasa has denied any connection
to the recent case, however the article itself raised serious questions about
foolishness of those speculations and the fact they were published in the
mainstream media.

The majority of voices mocks the content of the article referring to more
rational reason of the logo change – re-branding.
