The National Institute of Statistics and Census
([INEC](http://www.inec.gov.ec/web/guest/ecu_est/est_soc/enc_hog/enemdu) in
Spanish) released its quarterly report about unemployment in Ecuador.
According to the figures, there were 418,706 unemployed Ecuadorians, which
equals 9.1% of the 4.6 million Economically Active Population (EAP) in a
country with a total population of 14 million. According to the report,
unemployment in Ecuador went from 5.9% in 2008 to 6.5% in 2009 and 9.1% in the
first trimester of the 2010. However, some economists and even casual
observers believe that the number must be higher, in addition, to adding the
number of Ecuadorians underemployed. Regardless of the exact number of
Ecuadorians out of work, it is a serious problem that is of concern to the
administration of President Rafael Correa.

In light of the analysis made by [Carlos Felipe Jaramillo
[es]](http://andes.info.ec/actualidad/banco-mundial-ecuador-pudo-soportar-
crisis-economica-debido-a-sus-programas-y-politicas-de-estado-5859.html), the
World Bank Director for the Andean region, who said that this country has had
a notable grow in the last three years because in 2007 its growth was around
2%, while in 2008 it rose significantly to 6.5%, but in 2009, due to the
global crisis, the growth slowed. It was expected that the Ecuadorian economy
was going to collapse, but that did not happen. However, INEC figures indicate
that the impact of the economic downturn has had its share of negative
effects.

Some are blaming the drought in some parts of the country for contributing to
this unemployment, but others point to the heavy rains in other regions and
the overproduction of [grains like
rice](http://lahora.com.ec/frontEnd/main.php?idSeccion=1025189) that may have
a particular effect on the rise of unemployment. The data taken by the INEC
belongs to the provinces of Guayaquil, Quito, Cuenca, Machala y Ambato.

INEC's report shows that women are unemployed at a rate of 11.6% rate while
men reported 7.2%. What they do understand is they're paying more money for
[each case of milk,](http://radioguamote.blogspot.com/2010/04/leche-cuesta-
mas-aunque-el-regimen.html) storage silos of rice are collapsing and sugar
leakage across borders means that local consumers do not get it at any price.

There are some explanations for employment problem in Ecuador. Byron Villacis,
the INEC's director, is cited by [_Ecuador Imediato
[es]_.](http://www.ecuadorinmediato.com/Noticias/news_user_view/ecuador_registra_un_91_de_desempleo_en_el_primer_trimestre_de_2010
--124914 ) He explains that unemployment is traditionally higher during the
first quarter of each year due to the end of the school year in the Coastal
region and is the result of strong winter Ecuador have endured, especially in
towns of the Ecuadorian coast. The survey was taken in 127 urban Ecuadorian
centers in the five provinces. It showed that:

> El desempleo se redujo sustancialmente en ciudades como Machala donde bajó;
> del 10,9% registrado entre enero y marzo de 2009, a 8% en los mismos meses
> de 2010. Así mismo, en Guayaquil la cifra bajó; de 14% a 12,3%; en Cuenca,
> de 4,9% a 3,7%; y en Ambato, de 4,1% a 3,1%. Solo en Quito se muestra un
> leve incremento de 7% a 7,1%

Unemployment fell substantially in cities like Machala, where it fell from
10.9% recorded between January and March 2009, to 8% in the same months in
2010. Also, in Guayaquil, the figures dropped from 14% to 12.3%, in Cuenca,
from 4.9% to 3.7% and in Ambato, from 4.1% to 3.1%. Only in Quito does it show
a slight increase of 7% to 7.1%

[Johan Sebastian [es]](http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/la-revolucion-
las-empresas-y-el-desempleo-403793.html#comment-72521) from Guayaquil left a
comment on a article of HOY newspaper, and blames Correa's government for the
absence of any policies to reduce poverty. He writes, “They are busy on other
issues that they neglect to establish effective incentives for businesses and
promote exportation.”

The problem of unemployment is something that has been on the minds of
Ecuadorians for quite some time. Looking back at a blog post from the city of
Cuenca, Eugenio Stanculescu Moreno wrote in [_Democracia Verdadera
[es]_](http://democraciaverdaderaecuador.blogspot.com/2008/11/inec-registra-
aumento-de-el-desempleo.html) in 2008 about his hopes that the government will
take clear measures to fight unemployment:

It is bad enough to see no measures are being taken for these problems that
affect the people, we already have an unemployment rate that has been going
up, this is alarming to hear, to an Ecuador that was promised change, to a
country that was promised stability and a safe level of employment rates, I
wonder then, where is the change we all want? Ecuador needs to make a change
for the better, not to the worse, we don't need more unemployment, more
poverty, we do need educated people who can study, people who can work and can
have a peaceful and dignified life, we do not want to walk backwards where
things remain the same, and people gets disappointed again, people that
provided them with trust, trust that empowered the government, trustfulness
with which the country now again is disappointed.
