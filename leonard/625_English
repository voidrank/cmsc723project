Sakineh Ashtyanieh Mohammadi

Those condemned to be stoned in Iran now have a face in international media,
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashitiani, a 43-year-old mother of two, who was recently
sentenced to death by stoning for adultery.

She was found guilty by the court of having sexual relations with two men who
murdered her husband.

Her lawyer Mohmmad Mostafai
[says](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/18/sakineh-mohammadi-
ashtian_1_n_686920.html) the international outcry over the death sentence
might be enough to save her from execution. Mostafai recently fled Iran and is
now based in Norway, where he has publicized the case online and in
international media.

Unfortunately Sakineh's case is not unique in Iran. According to French
newspaper, [Le
Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/08/16/01003-20100816ARTFIG00401-l-europe-
se-mobilise-pour-l-iranienne-condamnee-a-mort.php), there are presently three
men and women condemned to be stoned in Iranian jails.

The International Committee Against Stoning [has
published](http://stopstonningnow.com/wpress/1812) a long list of people who
were stoned in Iran in the last 30 years.

**International Protest: From Australia to Georgia**

Citizens of several cities in the world protested against the stoning sentence
in Iran at the beginning of August. In recent weeks different organizations
launched demonstrations around the world to protest against Sakineh's death
sentence.

Women in Georgia organized several demonstrations to display their anger and
disgust and to support Sakineh.

**Against stoning around the world in photos**

Iranian blogger _Talelesiyasat_[
writes](http://talelesiyasat.parsiblog.com/1652906.htm) [fa]:

> When outside Iran speaking of Islam as a religion of love and kindness,
> foreigners immediately remind me about the stoning and lashing sentences and
> it makes me shameful. I want to say very clearly that we can not speak about
> Islamic and humanistic values and sentence people to be stoned… It is by the
> same double standards of [the State] to order public executions within the
> country and create propaganda outside Iran about their kindness…

_Sahargahan_[ who published the photo above, has
chosen](http://msahar.blogspot.com/2010/08/blog-post_13.html) “Stoning or holy
crime” as the title of his post. The blogger, who is against all kinds of
executions, says stoning is the worst.

> Stoning is the most shameful crime that a human being from the dawn of
> existence has committed.
