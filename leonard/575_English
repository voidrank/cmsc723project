On the 5th of September, journalist Albert Graves Chakussanga lost his life at
the hands of strangers who in cold blood shot him down inside his house, in
the neighbourhood of Viana in Luanda. According to [Reporters without
Borders](http://en.rsf.org/angola-journalist-with-critical-
radio-09-09-2010,38334.html), Chukassanga was killed from behind with a gun
equipped with a silencer. The sister in law of the journalist was inside of
the house, and did not notice anything. The motives for the killing have still
not been made clear. The issue did not merely pass quietly in the Angolan
blogosphere.

On the blog _[Pensar e Falar Angola](http://blogdangola.blogspot.com)_
[Thinking and Speaking Angola, pt] read the following:

> Familiares e vizinhos de Chakussanga encontraram o jornalista caído, baleado
> nas costas, em um corredor de sua casa no distrito de Viana, em Luanda, na
> manhã de segunda-feira, de acordo com jornalistas locais. Ele era
> apresentador de um programa semanal de notícias com participação de
> ouvintes, em língua Umbundu, na emissora privada Rádio Despertar.

Family and neighbors of Chakussange found him fallen, shot in the back, in the
hall of his house in the district of Viana, in Luana, on Monday morning,
according to local newspapers. He was presenter of a weekly call-in news
program in Umbundu language, on the private station Rádio Despertar [Wake-up
Radio].

Two questions arise. Was Chakussanga the victim of the criminality that
overshadows the city, or was he silenced for saying what he should not have?
The answer remains up in the air. According to what has been told, in the
search made in the house of the unfortunate journalist the only thing that was
missing was a bottle of gas [for cooking]. The police have made no arrests and
apparently, the death of Alberto Chakussanga or any other, is just one more
journalist’s death to be investigated.

Also according to the [blog](http://blogdangola.blogspot.com/),

Chakussanga had a legion of listeners in Ovimbundu, the major Angolan ethnic
group originating in the south of the country, the support base of the old
rebel movement
[UNITA](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni%C3%A3o_Nacional_para_a_Independ%C3%AAncia_Total_de_Angola),
according to local newspapers. Rádio Despertar was launched in December 2006
under the terms of the 2002 peace accords between the ruling party
[MPLA](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimento_Popular_de_Liberta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Angola)
and UNITA.

On the blog [_Universal_](http://patriciaguinevere.blogspot.com) __ [pt],
reference is made to the case of the killing of journalist Ricardo de Melo.
Even today, the case has yet to be resolved.

> O assassinato de Alberto Graves Chakussanga é mais um caso em que forças
> ocultas decidem silenciar jornalistas incómodos. A 18 de Janeiro de 1995, o
> director da publicação independente, ImparcialFAX, Ricardo de Melo, foi
> assassinado em Luanda. As autoridades nunca apuraram as circunstâncias da
> morte de mais esta voz de uma comunicação social não comprometida com o
> regime no poder.

The murder of the journalist Alberto Graves Chakussanga is yet another case of
hidden forces deciding to silence journalist who cause discomfort. On January
18, 1995, the director of the publication independent ImparcialFAX
[ImpartialFAX], Ricardo de Melo, was murdered in Luanda. Authorities never
found out the true circumstances of the death of this voice of a media source
uncompromised by the regime in power.

The author of the blog _[Em Angola](http://emangola.wordpress.com\))_ [pt]
also writes about the unfortunate journalist, not forgetting to mention that
the practice of journalism in Angola is still a risk.

> Não tivesse sido morto, o jornalista Alberto Graves Chakussanga talvez nunca
> ficasse conhecido. Uma busca pelo nome de Chakussanga no Google gera 16 mil
> resultados. A prática do jornalismo em Angola é delicada, já que o país é
> governado por um mesmo partido há três décadas, e não há muita liberdade de
> imprensa.

If he had not been murdered, the journalist Alberto Graves Chakussanga might
have never been well known. A search for the name Chakussanga generates 16,000
results. The practice of journalism in Angola is delicate, as the country is
governed by the same party for three decades, and there is not much media
freedom.

Numerous voices arose to condemn this death, like that of Reporters without
Borders and also Mohamed Keita, coordinator of Defense of Journalists in
Africa. In the declaration that he made, Keita appealed to Angolan authorities
to consider the possible reasons for this murder, bearing in mind the
journalistic work of the deceased. Joining these public condemnations is the
voice of Irina Bokova, director general of UNESCO. Bovoka regrets the death of
the journalist as well as other journalists of other nationalities who lost
their lives last month, revealing worry at the global wave of murders of
journalists.

[Update](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/23/angola-update-on-press-
freedom-repression-or-urban-violence/): One day after Global Voices published
this article, on October 22 another Angolan journalist from “Radio Despertar”
– Antonio Manuel “Jojó” da Silva – was injured in stabbing, as [Committee to
Protect Journalists reports](http://cpj.org/2010/10/in-angola-popular-radio-
