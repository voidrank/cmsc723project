Every year the winters are shrinking and a few days of cold weather leaves us
fresh and pleasant to face the scorching heat of the sun. This has left
everyone in every possible field worried because this global warming will
affect our life styles. The earth's climate is vibrant and always changing
through a natural cycle. What the world is more concerned about is that the
changes that are happening today have caught fire because of our very own
deeds. These transformations are being studied by scientists through out the
world in an attempt to find any evidence from tree rings, pollen samples, ice
cores, and sea sediments. The causes of climate change can be categorized into
two main categories – those that are due to natural causes and those that are
twisted by man. The natural causes are continental drifts, volcanoes, and
ocean currents accompanied by earth tilts, whereas the human factors range
from bomb blasts and population outgrowth which is resulting in less and less
greenery.

Many Pakistani Bloggers have written about this Climate Change. In a post
titled “[Climate Change Cost Pakistan $3.5 Billion in 18 Years”
](http://freebird.instablogs.com/entry/climate-change-cost-
pakistan-35-billion-in-18-years/) _Karim Khan_ states:

> Pakistan has huge reserves of coal that are used for running several
> industries on local scale in many areas. But emissions from coal
> persistently threaten the atmosphere with emissions that lead to escalating
> the greenhouse effect. The World Bank report mentions the Bank’s interest in
> developing hydropower capacity in Pakistan and Nepal. Also, it is suggested
> to import natural gas from the Middle East for industrial use instead of
> using coal, in order to protect the country from climate-related disaster.

Climate change has harshly endangered the natural habitats of much of the
wildlife populations. Some of the rare birds species like the black throated
thrush, finches, magpie and golden eagle have almost vanished as the local
ecosystems have been futile to sustain their needs. Many species of wolf and
fox and their natural habitats are also being endangered by the changing
climate. The departure of vegetative covering, which has led to the migration
of the Markhor and wild goats, has had ever negative implications for the
elusive snow leopard, which, has now lost its critical food source.

_Tahir Hameed_ at _The Pakistani Spectator_ writes in a post titled
“[Impending Global Warming and the
world](http://www.pakspectator.com/impending-global-warming-and-the-world/)”:

In another post in the same blog _Sher Ali_
[says](http://www.pakspectator.com/the-common-editorial-on-climate-change-tps-

This climate change can be only delayed by adopting a few measures such as:

  * By starting awareness programs at the grass root levels, small children should be made conscious about conserving and planting tress and plants for more greenery.
  * Promote genuine research programs on the part of developed nations to measure the ongoing damages to the natural environment of the mountainous communities in northern Pakistan.
  * Encourage innovative approaches to environmental challenges caused by climate change fully making use of our Indigenous information.
  * Help decrease pressure on the present forest belt by exploring convincing options to developing substitute energy sources.

The objective is to bring global warming under control by restraining the
discharge of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping “greenhouse” gases into
the atmosphere.

_[Lead Pakistan](http://www.lead.org.pk/)_ , the nation's largest network of
professionals on sustainable development, uploaded a two part series video in
YouTube highlighting voices from Pakistan on climate change ([Part
1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnHHxqs6LLY), [Part
2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb8x8itRpBQ&feature=related)):

We can contribute to this global cause by taking personal measures. We can
lend a hand instantaneously by becoming more energy efficient. Conserving and
limiting our use of oil, gasoline and coal can set an example for others to
pursue. If we do not do something now, we will leave a much larger crisis to
our children. The good news is that, if we all join hands in stopping the
climate change; we can decrease its impact on our lives, on our environment
and on future generations.
