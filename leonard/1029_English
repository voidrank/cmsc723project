What is disaster management? What are the various stages that it involves? The
terminology may differ depending on where you are. In New Zealand, for
example, you would be talking of the 4R’s, namely Readiness, Response,
Recovery and Reduction. In other places, such as India, it could be as
outlined in the graphic below:

Whatever the terminology, today it is an undeniable truth that the need of the
hour is effective disaster management and preparation for a growing incidence,
worldwide, of different forms of natural disasters.

In a series of posts, we shall trace and examine the increasing role and
impact of ICTs in the area of disaster management.

Nobel Laureate [R.K.
Pachauri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_K._Pachauri), while
[addressing](http://www.rkpachauri.org/pdf/ambani.pdf) the 5th convocation of
the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology
(DA-IICT) in January 2009, highlighted the need for ICTs in dealing with
natural disasters and other weather-related events that pose a threat to human
life and property.

Citing an example from 2003, Dr. Pachauri said:

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking at the [Telecom World
2009](http://www.itu.int/WORLD2009/) in Geneva, also
[highlighted](http://www.un.org/news/dh/pdf/english/2009/06102009.pdf) the
role of ICTs in addressing key issues, including natural disaster reduction.

The UN Secretary-General’s statement echoes the **paradigm shift** in Disaster
Management mentioned in the [2005
presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/sujit29/ict-in-disaster-risk-
reduction-india-case) by Sujit Mohanty, namely:

  * From relief and recovery to Risk & Vulnerability management
  * Introducing culture of preparedness at all levels
  * Strengthen decentralized response capacity in the country
  * Empowerment of vulnerable groups and ensuring livelihoods
  * Learning from past disasters.

In the aftermaths of large-scale natural calamities such as the 2004 [Indian
Ocean tsunami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake) and
[Hurricane Katrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) in 2005,
the world was forced to wake up to the need for coordinated and collaborative
harnessing of the power of ICT systems in managing natural disasters.

Paul Currion in [humanitarian.info](http://www.humanitarian.info/ict-and-
katrina/) stated that:

> _“In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, there has been an astonishing amount of
> activity in web-based initiatives responding to the consequences of the
> disaster. Examining the characteristics of the response of the technology
> community to Hurricane Katrina tells us much about the way the web has
> shaped social responses to disaster, raises some interesting issues about
> the impact of ICT in disaster response, and points towards what might happen
> in future.[…]_
>
> _“It was clear following the Indian Ocean tsunami that the information
> revolution was in the process of changing the way in which we respond to
> disasters. This was demonstrated by the rise of[web-based fund-
> raising](http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/thefacts/reliefresources/110554549992.htm);
> Christian Aid raised over __$_ _700,000 online in nine days, amounting to
> nearly four times as much as it raised through donations over the phone. The
> spread of broadband, improvements in satellite telecommunications and the
> availability of imagery has made possible GIS and cartographic projects that
> would not have been possible five years ago. The rise of the open source
> movement has led to initiatives such as the[Sahana
> ](http://cvs.opensource.lk/)project, an attempt to develop a suite of web-
> enabled applications for disaster response organisations._

Currion goes on to talk about the “first responders of the wired world”,
netizens who spring to action to fill in information gaps that the governments
of the respective countries and even the traditional media often struggle to
fill. However, given the [high influx of
information](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/wiki/katrina/) post-Katrina, it was soon
apparent that multiple data streams would be more effective if they were
collated, consolidated and served from a more centralized platform. Thus we
saw initiatives such as the [Katrina PeopleFinder
Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katrina_PeopleFinder_Project) and the
Katrina Help Wiki come into play.

In this context, it would not be unfair to say that the [South-East Asia
Earthquake and Tsunami (SEA-EAT) blog](http://tsunamihelp.blogspot.com/), set
up during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, was a trendsetter of sorts–the first
project of its kind that demonstrated the power of engaging ordinary people
effectively to channel information in order to bridge the gap between those
who needed help and those who had help to offer. According to [Dina
Mehta](http://dinamehta.com/profile/), one of the key people behind the SEA-
EAT blog,

> _“I think what we managed to do was demonstrate perhaps the largest
> ‘people's’ coordinated effort on the web during disasters, that it was
> possible and that too without any formal organizational structure. There’s
> also something in the ability for these efforts to bring in ordinary
> citizens from all walks of life – people who aren’t necessarily dedicated or
> working in this space – most of us have different professions and regular
> jobs too – but just a human need to help.”_

While the SEA-EAT blog focused on “keeping the information flowing”, the
[Sahana FOSS Disaster Management System](http://www.sahana.lk/) in Sri Lanka
functioned as a more structured, holistic system that helped manage the large
scale of the disaster of 2004. The project was deployed by the Sri Lankan
government's Center of National Operations (CNO) which included the Center of
Humanitarian Agencies (CHA). Generalized later for global use, Sahana has now
grown to become a globally recognized project with deployments in many other
disasters such as the [South Asian
earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Kashmir_earthquake) in Pakistan
(2005), Southern Leyte Mudslide Disaster in Phillipines (2006), the Jogjarkata
Earthquake in Indonesia (2006), the Peru Earthquake (2007), the Myanmar
Cyclone (2008), etc.

In 2005, Michael Gurstein of the New Jersey Institute of Technology [wrote his
reflections](http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/viewFile/229/184) on
the web-based initiatives and what he perceived as the need gaps in these
situations:

Observing the loss of lives in typhoon Ketsana that hit Philippines, Vietnam
and Cambodia in October 2009, Paul Conneally [posted the
following](http://headdowneyesopen.blogspot.com/2009/10/disaster-response-
failure-in-not-option.html) on his blog _Head Down, Eyes Open:_

In India, the 2004 tsunami was a clarion call for the government, NGOs and the
civil society to effect a paradigm shift and realise that preparedness was the
key to minimising the impact of natural disasters.

To enable better planning and preparedness, the India Disaster Resource
Network [idrn.gov.in] was set up as a National initiative under the Govt. of
India-UNDP DRM programme in collaboration with National Informatics Center,
Government of India. The task of this Network was to create an online database
for capturing the countrywide inventory of equipment and skilled human
resources available for emergency response. The role of this ambitious, yet
comprehensive database would be to help minimize emergency response time
through effective decision-making on mobilization of human & material
resources. The project was to ensure systematic data collection & collation
from government line departments, public sector units, the corporate sector,
etc at the district level. Other initiatives launched were:

  * _The Disaster Inventory Database_ (implemented in Orissa) that would allow vulnerability analysis through longitudinal study of geo-referenced inventories of local level data of past disasters (small, medium and large-scale).
  * _Community Contingency plans_ based on GIS technology that enable the visual presentation of critical data by location that can be used for coordination and implementation of relief efforts
  * _Development of communications infrastructure_ to ensure 100% coverage of disaster prone areas through satellite and ISDN linkages
  * _Community based ICT systems_ and
  * _Disaster/ incident surveillance system_ that will allow for quick, smooth, seamless data capturing and disseminating facilities.

Here is an example of implementation of this strategy/philosophy of
preparedness by an NGO in Tamil Nadu following the Indian Ocean Tsunami of
2004:  

In the next post in the series, we shall explore disaster warning systems and
the various ICT-based tools and applications that have been, are being, and
can be put to use as an early warning system to help reduce and or mitigate
the severe damage to life and property in the wake of natural disasters across
the globe.
