The extent and impacts of the recent floods in Pakistan are huge in every
context. The floods have so far claimed more than [1600
lives](http://www.pakreport.org/blog/?p=8) and about [20 million
people](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10973725), one tenth of
Pakistan population, are suffering and have become homeless. An area of over
160,000 square kilometers – around a fifth of Pakistan's total land – is
submerged.

The flood victims desperately need food, shelter, medicine, money and other
help. The Pakistan government's response to the crisis has been [reported as
sluggish](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/15/pakistan-sluggish-help-
for-the-flood-victims/). The government lacks infrastructure, money and other
resources and the efficacy of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)
has been [marred by bureaucracy](http://teeth.com.pk/blog/2010/08/11/op-ed-
managing-the-disaster-managers).

However it is heartening to see that common people, especially many youths of
Pakistan are traveling to the affected areas to help the victims. And more so
Pakistani netizens are in forefront as they are making their actions visible
though live blogs Twitter, images and videos. It is really remarkable and can
be an example for other communities how netizens can contribute to the society
in disaster management in a coordinated way – which sometime overshadows the
state efforts.

We are proud to inform that several of the Global Voices Pakistan authors are
traveling in different parts of Pakistan to distribute relief. Global Voices
authors [Awab Alvi](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/awab-alvi/) and
[Faisal Kapadia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/faisal-kapadia/)
coordinated with team of volunteers at Motorsports Club of Pakistan,
OffroadPakistan and SARelief to conduct on and offline donation drives to
collect funds for relief.

The team went on to the first relief drive to Sukkur in Sindh region on the
14th and 15th of August. Using Twitter and GPS tracking they [logged their
effort](http://teeth.com.pk/blog/2010/08/14/live-tracking):

  

> 6 trucks of relief good valued at more then Rs. 2.4 Million – four trucks of
> standardized basic food valued at Rs. 16,80,000, one truck containing a
> mixture of food hampers acquired from Makro at a cost of Rs. 4,43,585 and
> the sixth truck laden with tents and water bottles valued at Rs. 6,75,000.
> We are also trucking 250 1-kg tin cans of read-to-eat biryani generously
> donated by a friend of ours. We are not taking any medicine, but hope to
> concentrate on a medical relief later. ([Teeth

Sana Saleem, another Global Voices author from karachi, and a project
coordinator for a the non-profit youth organisation called “[Future Leaders of
Pakistan](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Future-Leaders-of-Pakistan-
FLP/8885330850)” (FLP) also traveled to Sindh and the Swat Valley. Sana
[shares her experience](http://blog.dawn.com/2010/08/24/identifying-and-
customising-relief-packages/) at Dawn Blog:

> Our day began with identifying affected areas to begin distribution. Sujawal
> situated in Thatta district was identified as the base camp for distribution
> of aid. According to the District Officers, Sujawal hosts over 27,500
> internally displaced families. Living in abysmal conditions most of these
> people were living by the roadside on charpai and temporary tents made out
> of mere straw. The living conditions deteriorated as we traveled further
> into Sujawal. Roads had been inundated at various points and families were
> forced to take shelter in areas where there was no electricity. Snakes,
> other insects and stray dogs were rampant and the families live under a high
> risk of being attacked by them.

She notes:

> Efforts like these prove that there is still hope for Pakistan. As people
> continue to fight and help each other in these tough times, one only hopes
> that the rest of the world will also donate generously to help the millions
> affected by the floods.
