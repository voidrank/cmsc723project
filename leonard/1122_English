In the Israeli blogosphere you rarely get the feeling that everyone is
listening and no one is talking, and that's the case today with the debut of a
short film called [“ _Closed Zone_.”](http://www.closedzone.com/) A 90-second
animated film about the sealed Gaza border crossings, “ _Closed Zone_ ”
already has 31,600 hits and 200 text comments on _YouTube_ , and counting.

[_Promised Land_](http://www.promisedlandblog.com/?p=646) all post the video
and its background information, but refrain from commentary.

_Checkpoint Jerusalem's_ Dion Nissenbaum
[offers](http://washingtonbureau.typepad.com/jerusalem/2009/03/bashir-
animator-animates-gaza-siege.html) context and a description of the film,
explaining that _“Closed Zone”_ was created for the Israeli non-profit
[Gisha](http://www.gisha.org/index.php?intLanguage=2), which works to protect
the freedom of movement for the [1.4 million
residents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip) of the Gaza Strip.

In their report on the closure of the Gaza crossings, in effect for the past
18 months, Gisha
[writes](http://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications_english/Publications%20and%20Reports_English/Gaza%20Closure%20Defined%20Eng\(1\).pdf):

> Gisha's position is that the closure is illegal because it punishes
> civilians in the Gaza Strip for acts they did not commit and for political
> circumstances beyond their control. The closure inflicts harm to the
> civilian population and civilian institutions by blocking the passage of
> goods necessary for health, well-being, and economic life.

“ _Closed Zone_ ‘s” creator is [Yoni Goodman](http://www.yonigoodman.com/).
Goodman is best known for his role as Director of Animation for [“ _Waltz with
Bashir_ ,”](http://waltzwithbashir.com/) winner of Best Foreign Film at the
Golden Globes Award and [widely
believed](http://washingtonbureau.typepad.com/jerusalem/2009/02/israel-poised-
to-win-first-academy-award.html) to be the front runner for the same category
at the 2009 Academy Awards. (Japan's “ _Departures_ ” won instead.)

In an interview with the _Jerusalem Post_ at the time of the “ _Closed Zone_
‘s” release, Goodman
[explains](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1236103156488&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull):

> “I hate Hamas. They're out to kill us. Of course they are my enemies. I feel
> sorry for the Palestinian citizens who want to live their lives… People
> don't like to hear that Palestinians are real people. People prefer to think
> of them as evil, that they're all Hamas. It's easier to say, ‘let's punish
> them, let's kill them all.’ It's a lot harder to regard them as ordinary
> people who want peace.

In the companion video “ _Closed Zones: Behind the Scenes_ ,” Goodman
emphasizes:

> The war made this project a mission for me. The character is a kid, he is
> kind of a kid and kind of an adult, a bit Arab and a bit Jewish, something
> that everyone can connect to. It is important not to turn this into a
> stereotypical film.

Gisha Executive Director Sari Bashi adds:

> We chose the medium of animation to try to get viewers to recognize the
> humanity of the residents of Gaza. It is increasingly difficult to remind
> people that residents of the Gaza Strip are human beings who wish to raise
> children, to earn a living, to realize their dreams, both small and large.

The release of “Closed Zone” coincides with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton's first trip to the Middle East, where she announced the United
States’ pledge of $900 million to help rebuild the Gaza Strip after this
winter's [war with
Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict).
This amount will be significantly bolstered by the $5 billion raised by donors
at this week's conference in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt.

But Israel will have the final say in whether to open the border crossings to
commercial and civilian traffic. Support of the international community will
be sought to ensure needs are met on both sides of the border. Mark Regev,
spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
[affirms](http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-03-02-voa57.cfm):

> With supplies like concrete, with steel, unfortunately you could have a
> situation where that is diverted by Hamas, and instead of helping people to
> rebuild houses, they'll be building underground bunkers for their own
> military machine. So I think we in the international community have to find
> mechanisms to make sure that aid for the people of Gaza is precisely that.
