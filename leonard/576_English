[Barbados](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados) – along with the rest of the
region – is in mourning following [the untimely
death](http://repeatingislands.com/2010/10/24/region-reacts-to-death-of-
barbados-prime-minister/) of Barbadian [Prime Minister David
Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thompson_%28Barbadian_politician%29),
who [passed away
yesterday](http://guardian.co.tt/news/politics/2010/10/23/barbados-prime-
minister-david-thompson-dies-cancer) from [pancreatic
cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer). At 48 years old, he
was one of the youngest Caribbean heads of state, having led the [Democratic
Labour Party](http://www.dlpbarbados.org/cms/) to victory in Barbados’ hotly-
contested general election in January 2008, winning by a landslide against the
incumbent [Barbados Labour Party](http://blp.org.bb/).

[across the Caribbean](http://bimchat.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/barbadians-

their respects…](http://bajan.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/prime-minister-david-

_[Barbados in Focus](http://barbadosinfocus.blogspot.com/2010/10/david-john-
howard-thompsonrip.html)_ laments the loss of “a son”:

> No matter your political affiliation, religion, economic standing, or social
> position, please join me in sending condolences to family of the late David
> John Howard Thompson, the sixth Prime Minister of Barbados. He will be
> missed by the nation of Barbados, and by people throughout the Caribbean.

_[Barbados Free
Press](http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/barbados-prime-
minister-david-thompson-dead-of-cancer-at-48/)_ republishes the late Prime
Minister’s final letter to his St. John constituents and adds:

> He fought hard, with courage and with the dignity that was always part of
> his character in public and in private…it is a mercy that he had time to
> prepare himself, his loved ones, his friends and his beloved Barbados for
> his passing.
>
> Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Mara, and his three daughters
> Misha, Oya and Osa and David’s mum, Margaret Knight.

In [a later post](http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/musical-
tribute-to-prime-minister-david-thompson/), the blog uploads a musical tribute
to Thompson.

_[Boyce Voice](http://www.boycevoice.com/blog/2010/10/23/i-remember-pm-
david/)_ ‘s post takes on a personal tone:

> I first met David at Combermere when I entered that school back in 1974.  
>  I remember David in the hallowed school hall of “Waterford University”
> participating in “mock” parliamentary debates; it was the beginning of his
> potential as a debater and orator of great skill.
>
> I remember David as a lawyer…there were several times throughout the years
> where our cultural objectives would be endangered by some nefarious anti
> cultural villain and we would call out to David, he would swoop down like a
> caped legal crusader and save us from certain artistic demise.
>
> I remember David as a Prime Minister, the first PM to come forth from the
> University of Waterford, I had the privilege of working with him during the
> campaign. I remembered after the last elections and my telephone rang and I
> answered “Hello Mr Prime Minister” for that was the first time a PM had ever
> called me…
>
> Such was the measure of the man, Gone but never to be forgotten; may he Rest
> in Peace, I remember PM David..

_[Caribbean Lionesse](http://caribbeanlionesse.blogspot.com/2010/10/farewell-
pm-thompson.html)_ shares how she felt when she heard the news:

> Call me foolish but I really was shaken when I got the call around 5 a.m.
> this morning. It felt like it had been so long that he had been ill that I
> had started to convince myself he would hold on and be in that small sliver
> of those who survive pancreatic cancer.
>
> Like most Barbadians home and away I am saddened. It really is a personal
> tragedy writ large. He's not even 50. His children aren't even done raised
> yet. It truly is unfair and makes you wonder why.

In the midst of grieving, _[Barbados
Underground](http://bajan.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/a-nation-in-mourning-
congratulates-the-seventh-prime-minister-of-barbados-fruendel-stuart/)_
thought it appropriate to welcome “the seventh Prime Minister of Barbados” to
his new post:

> The government will join Barbadians to mourn the passing of Prime Minister
> David Thompson in the coming days before being expected to settle down to
> the business of navigating the raging global economic storm.
>
> Prime Minister Stuart is not unfamiliar functioning in the role of Prime
> Minister albeit in the shadow of the events caused by the illness of former
> Prime Minister David Thompson in recent months. Barbadians will have high
> expectations of Stuart now that he has assumed the position of Prime
> Minister in his own right.

Bloggers from other nations are also offering their condolences; Jamaican
diaspora blogger [Dennis
Jones](http://potomacgrasshopper.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/another-one-taken-
too-soon/), who lived in Barbados for many years, writes:

> At the tender age of 48, he died from pancreatic cancer a few hours ago. His
> family, friends and the whole country will mourn his passing. A young
> national leader is a rarity in the Caribbean, and as one of those sometimes
> termed the ‘Independence generation’, he was a shining star. Whatever his
> political opponents may think or say, his leadership was not complete and
> will be now hard to judge. He took his post during one of the most difficult
> of economic times and his efforts to chart a way through were never going to
> meet universal approval. His death may provide a moment that helps turn
> Barbados towards finding a unity that may be more important than ever in
> helping solve its economic problems.

_[Jdid](http://jdidthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/10/rip.html)_ says:

> My condolences to his family and the nation. Every one has their appointed

> My prayers also go out to the new PM Mr Fruendel Stuart and his cabinet as

Finally, _[Abeni](http://hairoun.blogspot.com/2010/10/rip-david-
thompson.html)_ , blogging from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, recalls two
occasions on which her paths had crossed with the late Prime Minister's:

> For close to half an hour I sat quietly and thought about David Thompson,
> his family, his political journey, his illness and his death.
>
> I didn't know David Thompson beyond a chance meeting in Kingstown…the thing
> that struck me most about that encounter was his approachable, no frills,
> down to earth manner.
>
> Slowly the tears came. Tears of anger that cancer had once more wreaked
> havoc and taken yet another life. Tears of dismay that a cure still seems so
> distant.Tears that a young vibrant man had been cut down just when he had
> finally attained his dream of leading his country…I wish to express my
> heartfelt sympathies to his family, close friends and the nation of
> Barbados…
