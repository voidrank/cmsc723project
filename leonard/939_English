A video interview [en] of [Kyo Kageura](http://kyokageura.seesaa.net/), head
of the project [Minna no Honyaku](http://trans-aid.jp/) (みんなの翻訳, _Translation
for all_ ) [ja], a new translation platform that helps NGOs and NPOs to spread
their messages thanks to volunteer translators.

Global Voices Japan asked him about [the challenge of Minna no
Honyaku](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20090422a1.html) [en], the
difficulties and the new frontiers of volunteer translation.

The project _Minna no Honyaku_ or _Translation for all_ is the brainchild of
Language Translation Group of the National Institute of Information and
Communication Technology and Library and Information Science Laboratory of the
University of Tokyo, in cooperation with publishing company Sanseido.

Thought as a part of the _Shiitake Project_ , the realization of a platform to
stimulate the growth of online translation has a [precise
purpose](http://panflute.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kyo/shiitake_e.html):

> This system will ultimately enable individual translators to form a network,
> without any additional or conscious effort, in which translators working on
> similar or related domains can collectively accumulate translation data and
> share information relevant to their translations. This, we believe, will
> enhance the activity of translators and encourage potential translators to
> join in. As such, the Shiitake project is ultimately a social project.

Lastly, with the aim to make translation an easy process also to inexperienced
translators, Professor Kageura's team created _Minna no Honyaku_ , convinced
that:

> The translation of news and reports by volunteers plays a vital role in this
> alternative information flow.
