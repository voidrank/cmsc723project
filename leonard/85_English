[ ](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/los-
proyectiles.jpg)Land distribution patterns in Guatemala are of the most
inequitable in Latin America and the World: 2% of the population owns 70% of
all productive farmland, and most of the owners are not exploiting it.

Most of the Guatemalan poor are indigenous peoples living in rural areas and
working in agriculture. They face an alarming

[malnourished

[Latifundio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latifundio) owners are dedicating
lands that were once used to produce food for locals to biodiesel crops or
sugar cane, due to the rising price for these crops and the low tech and low
number of peasants they require for cultivation, as the blog [_El
Polvorin_](http://elpolvorin.over-blog.es/article-guatemala-monocultivos-de-
palma-y-ca-a-de-azucar-lesionan-a-comunidades-del-rio-coyolate-63829877.html)
[es] explains. This is risking the food security of thousands who live below
the poverty line.

Indigenous families live on a very humble diet, as described by the blog
[_Mayan Families_](http://mayanfamilies-sharon.blogspot.com/2011/05/rising-
food-costs-mean-more-hunger-in.html):

> Most of the indigenous families have tortillas as staple in their diet.
> Often when families do not have anything else to eat, they can always have
> tortillas with salt, but now, even that is threatened by the shortage of
> corn and the rising cost of what is available.

As a survival mechanism and due to the lack of job opportunities and public
policies to assist them, many families are using small portions of the
underused productive lands (where they were born and have always lived) to
produce the food their families need for their survival: corn, beans and some
vegetables.

This is increasing the number of land disputes, as owners want peasants out of
their private property and often use the help of armed forces and violent
means to evict them. Human casualties from these evictions are often under-
reported by the media.

That was the case last week, when a peasant was murdered by security forces
during a land eviction in
[Retalhuleu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retalhuleu_Department), near the
Guatemalan Pacific coast. There, Sergio de León, a 31-year-old landless
peasant, father of five, was killed when the police fired a tear gas canister
directly to his heart. Independent video journalist and blogger [Alberto
Arce](http://albertoarce.com/) [es] filmed this eviction (WARNING: graphic

In the article “[Yet another peasant killed in a land
dispute](http://plazapublica.com.gt/content/otro-campesino-muerto-por-la-
tierra)” [es] [_Plaza Publica_](http://plazapublica.com.gt) [es], a new
digital media outlet unveiling corruption and defying the traditional self
censorship of the Guatemalan media, describes the Sergio de León tragedy and
the dilemmas the poor face in Guatemala to survive.

On one side peasants fight and risk their lives to defend the land that will
provide food for their children, the land where they were born, where their
parents were born, where their whole family has worked all their lives. On the
other side poor and under-trained police and members of the army have to
follow the orders to shoot and use violence against peasants – as poor as they
are, from common origins – as a way to keep their jobs, to feed their
families. The third player in this conflict is a government unwilling to solve
the growing number of land conflicts and inequality in land distribution.

Death is the solidarity of the current government, according to the [_Popular
Front_ ](http://frentepopularsds.blogspot.com/2011/07/muerte-la-solidaridad-
del-gobierno-de.html) [es] blog:

> El saldo ha sido un campesino ejecutado extrajudicialmente, tres campesinos
> más con heridas, viviendas campesinas destruidas, además del trauma causado
> especialmente a los niños quienes grabarán de por vida la respuesta que el
> “gobierno de la solidaridad” les ha propinado. Fuerza armada ante la demanda
> de tierra y de fuente de trabajo. Estado, al servicio del capital, en contra
> de la clase campesina. Esa es la respuesta y esta es la realidad histórica
> que se confirma. Nunca fue una política pública, una alternativa laboral,
> una solución negociada, ya no digamos una transformación de la estructura
> agraria. Siempre fue la defensa del régimen de propiedad que nos ha privado
> de todo y del modelo económico para continuar acumulando por explotación,
> por desposesión y por exclusión de las grandes mayorías.

The balance is the extrajudicial execution of a peasant, three other peasants
wounded, peasant's houses destroyed and a traumatic experience, especially for
children. They will always remember the brutal response from the ‘solidarity
government’. A state, in the service of capital, against the working class,
the peasants. That was the response and that is our historical reality,
confirmed. There has never been public policies or negotiation to solve the
problem, alternative jobs, nor an integral transformation to the agricultural
structure. It is always the system defending private property, a system which
has deprived us from everything. It is always the defense of an economic model
based on exploitation, deprivation and exclusion of the majority of the
population.

Land conflicts and unequal distribution of wealth, which have increased due to
economic crises in the last two decades, were core topics of the 1996 Peace
Agreements. Poorly trained police serving the interest of the powerful is the
other problem; De León's murder is not an isolated case. As different blogs
mention, there have been several cases of excessive use of force while
performing evictions, like in [Nueva
Linda](http://www.justicianuevalinda.org/) [es], [Salvador
Xolhuitz](http://www.adital.com.br/site/noticia.asp?lang=ES&cod=45156) [es],
[Bella Flor Community](http://frentepopularsds.blogspot.com/2011/04/familia-
widman-continua-destruyendo.html) [es] and in other areas near the Polochic
river, always with police assistance, always with [human
costs](http://www.albedrio.org/htm/articulos/m/maa-500.htm) [es] on the
peasants’ side.

In the official blog of ‘Global Visionaries’, in the article “[Landlessness,
Hunger and Social Change in
Guatemala](http://gvisionaries.wordpress.com/2011/04/13/landlessness-hunger-
and-social-change-in-guatemala/)” Camron McDonald describes an eviction which
took place earlier this year, describing similar abuses from armed forces:

> On March 15, 2011 more than 1,000 police and soldiers showed up in the
> Polochic Valley of Northern Guatemala.They were there to evict more than
> 3,000 Q’eqchi Maya Indians living on land claimed by a Guatemalan
> agribusiness firm. Many of these families have been living on and tending to
> this land for thirty years.According to Danilo Valladares, writer for the
> Inter Press Service, security forces burnt or bulldozed the peasants’ shacks
> and destroyed their subsistence crops with machetes and tractors. One young
> man was killed in the scuffle and many others were injured. Now, close to
> 800 families have been left homeless and without access to the land they
> need to grow food to eat.

He also adds:

> At this point, you might be asking, how did it come to this? Unfortunately,
> this tragedy is only one of hundreds of cases similar it that have taken
> place throughout Guatemala’s history. Repeated calls for land reform over
> the years have been met with little real change. Today, the wealthiest 5
> percent of the population owns 80 percent of the land. A lack of political
> will and a lack of clear laws regarding land tenure often lead to long drawn
> out disputes that usually end in favor of the wealthy and powerful.
> Meanwhile, landlessness has been identified as one of the leading causes of
> the wide-scale poverty and hunger that continues to plague the country.

The Chief of Police who gave the orders to evict Sergio de León was neither
arrested nor sanctioned. The policeman who used a non lethal weapon (tear gas)
with lethal purposes (shooting at the peasant's chest) was not arrested
either. The community returned to the occupied land as they do not have
anywhere else to go, but the police might return at anytime. And this is only
one of approximately [1360 land
disputes](http://www.diariowebcentroamerica.com/region/guatemala-
mil-360-conflictos-por-tierras-hay-en-el-pais/) [es]. A different policy and a
different way to solve land conflicts and eradicate hunger is not only
necessary but urgent.
