The world is still in shock over the mass-murder of at least 85 people
attending a political youth camp on the island Utøya in Norway on the evening
of Friday, 22 July 2011. The killer, [now identified as Anders Behring
Breivik](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/24/norway-the-online-traces-
of-a-mass-murderer), masqueraded as a police officer before opening fire on
everyone around him, and chasing those who fled to the water. Breivik is also
the prime suspect behind a bombing in Oslo only few hours earlier that killed
seven people and caused extensive damage to government buildings.

The [Utøya summer camp ](http://auf.no/-/page/show/utoya?sandbox_id=1063610)is
an annual event of [AUF (Arbejdernes Ungdomsfylking)
](http://auf.no/-/sandbox/show)the youth organization of the Norwegian [Labour
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(Norway\)). Young people
from across the country gather to discuss politics, listen to music, play
sports and hear speeches by current and former politicians. Utøya is less than
an hour's drive from central Oslo. Earlier in the day, before the gunman
arrived, [AUF's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/#!/aufnorge) [no] and the
[#Utøya](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Utøya) hashtag showed that
approximately 700 participants were [discussing the environment, women's
rights, and Middle East
politics](https://twitter.com/#!/aufnorge/status/94354394111414273). It was
raining, but [the mood was
good](https://twitter.com/#!/aufnorge/status/94308622418444288). Later, the
Twitter account went silent.

Prableen Kaur

**A story of survival**

On Saturday, Prableen Kaur, a 23-year old local politician and youth leader
from Oslo, posted [a firsthand account of what
happened](http://prableen.origo.no/-/bulletin/show/672218_helvete-paa-utoeya)
to her on her blog in Norwegian. She fled the killer and managed to survive,
using her mobile phone, Twitter, and Facebook to tell family and friends she
was still alive. The Telegraph newspaper in the UK has [translated the entire
blog post to
English](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8656963/Norway-
shooting-politician-describes-witnessing-Utoya-massacre-on-her-blog.html) on
Saturday. Several hundred people have left comments on Kaur's blog offering
support and best wishes.

Here are excerpts from her traumatic story:

> Jeg har våknet. Jeg klarer ikke å sove mer. Jeg sitter i stuen. Føler sorg,
> sinne, lykke, Gud jeg vet ikke hva. Det er for mange følelser. Det er for
> mange tanker. Jeg er redd. Jeg reagerer på hver minste lyd. Jeg vil nå
> skrive om hva som skjedde på Utøya. Hva mine øyne så, hva jeg følte, hva jeg
> gjorde.

I woke up. I cannot sleep anymore. I am sitting in the living room. Feeling
grief, anger, happiness, God, I do not know what. There are too many emotions.
Too many thoughts. I am afraid. I react to the slightest sound. I want to
write about what happened on Utøya. What my eyes saw, what I felt, what I did.

> Vi hadde hatt krisemøte i hovedbygget etter eksplosjonene i Oslo. Etter det
> var det et eget møte for medlemmene fra Akershus og Oslo. Etter møtene
> befant mange, mange seg rundt og i hovedbygget. Vi trøstet oss med at vi var
> trygge på en øy. Ingen hadde visst at helvete ville bryte ut hos oss også.

We had a crisis meeting in the main building after the explosions in Oslo.
After that there was a meeting for the members from Akershus and Oslo. After
the meetings there were many, many people around and inside the main building.
We consoled ourselves that we were safe on an island. Nobody could know that
hell would break loose where we were too.

Kaur describes the confusion and horror as people around her heard the gun
shots and ran to a back room, seeking cover on the floor. People began to jump
out the window as the shooting continued, and she describes fearing she would
die as the last person to jump. She recovered from a hard landing and ran
further into the woods. She phoned her mother, crying, saying she didn't know
if she would survive.

At this moment, she tweeted:

>
> [@PrableenKaur](https://twitter.com/#!/PrableenKaur/status/94434416008503298):
> Jeg lever foreløpig.

@PrableenKaur: I'm still alive.

Her story continues:

> Folk hoppet ut i vannet, begynte å svømme. Jeg ble liggende. Jeg bestemte
> meg for at hvis han kom, skulle jeg spille død. Jeg skulle ikke løpe eller
> svømme. Jeg kan ikke beskrive frykten, alle tankene, det jeg følte.
>
> En man kom. ”Jeg er fra politiet.” Jeg ble liggende. Noen skrek tilbake at
> han måtte bevise det. Jeg husker ikke helt hva ham sa, men morderen begynte
> å skyte. Han ladet. Skjøt mer. Han skjøt de rundt meg. Jeg ble liggende. Jeg
> tenke: ”Nå er det over. Han er her. Han tar meg. Nå dør jeg.” Folk skrek.
> Jeg hørte at andre ble skutt. Andre hoppet ut i vannet. Jeg lå der. Mobilen
> i hånden. Jeg lå oppå beina til en jente. To andre lå oppå mine bein. Jeg
> ble liggende. Det tikket inn tekstmeldinger. Mobilen ringte flere ganger.
> Jeg ble liggende. Jeg spilte død. Jeg lå der i minst en time. Det var helt
> stille. Jeg vred forsiktig på hodet for å se om jeg kunne se noen levende.
> Jeg så lik. Jeg så blod. Frykt. Jeg bestemte meg for å reise meg. Jeg hadde
> ligget oppå et lik. To lik lå på meg. Jeg hadde englevakt.

People jumped into the water and started swimming. I was lying down. I decided
that if he came, I would play dead. I would not run or swim. I cannot describe
the fear that took over my mind, what I felt.
