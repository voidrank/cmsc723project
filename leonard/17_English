Air pollution has been a public enemy to millions of Iranians for years. It is
no longer surprising news when the government some days shuts down public
institutions due to air pollution.

Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health [declared
](http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1783975)that last year
more than 4,400 people lost their lives because of air pollution in Tehran,
Iran's capital.

**Dusty Tehran**

There are several cartoons that have been shared with Iranian netizens about
Tehran's pollution. Omid drew a cartoon on [
Iroon.com](http://iroon.com/irtn/cartoon/161/) to show dusty Tehran.

Mana Neyastani did not forget politics [in his
cartoon](http://mardomak.org/cartoons/full/75527) on pollution: “Grandfather”
says “It's morning again, and I should wake up… all this bad news…executions,
prison…” “Grandfather” takes a deep breath to start his day and falls down
beside a journal with the headline: “Deadly pollution of Tehran's air”

**Dark City**

Here is a video showing a dark polluted Tehran at noon as an airplane lands in
Mehrabad's airport.

We should not forget that people in many other cities in Iran have become the
victims of pollution too, such as the southern city
