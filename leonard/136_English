The YouTube video showing a kindergarten teacher singing with her students to
keep them calm during a shooting in Monterrey, Mexico has spread almost
virally through the Spanish speaking countries.

The video [recorded by the teacher on a
cellphone](http://youtu.be/AlmNj5T_Brc) shows a classroom full of very young
children lying on the floor. The teacher is heard gently asking her students
to keep their heads on the floor while shots are heard in the background. She
reassures the children that everything is ok, and that they'll be safe in the
classroom, reminding them to keep their heads down. To distract them, she
starts singing with them. She selects the Raindrop Song from the Barney show:
in Spanish, it wonders about what would happen if raindrops were made out of
chocolate and how you'd open the mouth wide to catch them all. By getting the
children to sing the song she managed not only to keep them calm but also to
have them stay with their heads on the floor, as she prompted them to turn
over and look up to the sky with their mouths opened wide.

[Local
media](http://www.nuevoleonenlinea.com/newsmanager/templates/nota.aspx?articleid=32307&zoneid=11)
has identified the school as being located in the Colonia Nueva Estanzuela,
just meters away from where an armed group on seven vans arrived to murder
five people at an independent taxi base, and the teacher, whose identity is
yet unknown has been called a hero and has been recognized by media and
viewers for showing courage, character and love to her wards.
