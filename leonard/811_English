[![global_pulse](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2010/03/global_pulse1.jpg)](http://www.globalpulse2010.gov/index.html)From
March 29 to 31, [Global Pulse 2010](http://www.globalpulse2010.gov) aims to
gather over 20.000 individuals and representatives of organisations in an
online conversation dealing with topics ranging from human development to
science and technologies.

The event is sponsored by [US Agency for International Development
(USAID)](http://www.usaid.gov/), and the goal is to give world citizens an
opportunity to voice opinions and share ideas for innovative solutions to
social issues. According to USAID, the inspiration for the online event is a
speech President Barack Obama [gave in Cairo in June
2009](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/12/egypt-obama-to-address-muslim-
world-from-egypt/) in which he said he would [promote
partnership](http://www.whitehouse.gov/Blog/NewBeginning) with the rest of the
world.

**Ten topics of discussion**

The event will start at 0 am (GMT) and will last 72 hours non-stop, and
participants will be able to follow and comment in several live discussions
simultaneously. All discussions will be led by
[featured](http://www.globalpulse2010.gov/guests.html) opinion leaders,
decision makers and NGO members, including [Youssou
N'Dour](http://sen24heures.com/spip.php?article1119) [fr], famous Senegalese
singer, deeply engaged in the fight against malaria, Iqbal Z. Quadir, founder
of [Grameenphone](http://www.grameenphone.com/index.php?id=78) in Bangladesh,
and even [Ethan Zuckerman](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/), co-founder of
Global Voices Online.

Participants from at least [128
countries](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=t&chs=440x220&chtm=world&chf=bg,s,336699&chco=d0d0d0,cc0000&chd=s:99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999&chld=ALAFDZARAMAUATAZBHBDBYBEBJBMBTBOBABRBGMMCMCACFCNCOCGCRCYCZDKECEGETFJFIFRGMDOGEDEGHGTGWHNHUISINIDIQIEILITJMCLJPJOKZKEKRKWKGLBLYLTMKMYMLMWMTMRMXMDMANPNLNZNINENGNOOMPKPQPAPYPEPHPLPTPRQARORUSASNRSSLSGSOZAESLKSZSECHSYTWTJTZTHTGTNTRUGUAAEGBUSVEUYVNYEZMZWKH)
will share and discuss on ten broad topics, listed here :

  * Inspiring a new generation
  * Empowering Women and Girls
  * Enabling the Essential Education
  * Building Stronger Partnerships
  * Exercising Political and Civil Rights
  * Promoting Global Health
  * Advancing Entrepreneurship, Trade & Economic Opportunity
  * Fostering Science, Technology & Innovation
  * Supporting a Sustainable Planet
  * Pursuing Grand Challenges

**Innovative technology**

Gathering thousands of people online at the same time could be tricky.
Fortunately, the forum technology that will be used, [IBM
Jam](https://www.collaborationjam.com/), has been already been tested in
previous events.

Bill Tipton took part in [Habitat
Jam](http://www.globaldialoguecenter.com/exhibits/backbone/index.shtml) – a
three-day online event in 2005 to solicit ideas on urban sustainability. In a
blog at the Global Dialogue Center he [shares his
experience](http://globaldialoguecenter.blogs.com/disabilities/2010/03/global-
pulse-people-with-perceived-differences-have-your-voices-heard.html):

> I know this can work from participating in such an event in 2005 […] Tens of
> thousands of individuals – including government and business leaders, NGOs
> and specialists — came together to discuss real issues and concerns facing
> the world’s urban communities.
>
> […]
>
> I still meet and work with people I met in that truly remarkable Jam and
> expect to meet other extraordinary individuals in Global Pulse in 2010.

**Participating**

To join the Global Pulse event, you only need a computer and internet access –
and you also have to [register](http://www.globalpulse2010.gov/register.html)
in advance (for free). Before March 29, you can follow
[@globalpulse2010](http://twitter.com/GlobalPulse2010) on Twitter as well as
the hashtag [#gp2010](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23gp2010). There is
also a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-
Pulse-2010/327872951484?v=wall) with almost 700 fans, where suggestions have
already been posted.

One idea by [Oliver Mupila](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-
Pulse-2010/327872951484?v=wall#!/pages/Global-
Pulse-2010/327872951484?v=feed&story_fbid=383520286484&ref=mf) goes:

> Query: Can Global Pulse suggest effective indicators for tracking the
> progress of grand corruption cases from referral to the investigating
> agencies, through to the Director of Prosecutions, onward to the courts and
> progress while they are in court without compromising the individuals right
> to a fair trial/hearing or reputation before they are convicted? What is
> considered good practice in this area and are there any countries that do
> this particularly well? And why are news writers in Africa not in good books
> [of] the government?

According to Dr. Rajiv Shah, Adminsitrator of USAID, the online summit will
gather “individuals who are not normally seated at the table with key decision
makers”. Could this be a move towards the future of democracy? It should at
least be interesting to find out.
