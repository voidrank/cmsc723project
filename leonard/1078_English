[Blog Action Day](http://www.blogactionday.org/ "Blog Action Day"), codenamed
#bad09 by tech gurus and geeks, is an annual event that unites the world's
bloggers in posting about the same issue on the same day. The aim of the event
is to raise awareness and trigger a global discussion on that particular day.
This year Blog Action Day took place on October 15, with bloggers all over the
world writing on the topic of climate change. Below is a round-up of the
various posts by members of the Ghana Blogging Group on Blog Action Day.

Gameli Adzaho, author of [The Gamelian World](http://gamelmag.blogspot.com/)
Blog, presented a post on “[5 Voices on climate
Change](http://gamelmag.blogspot.com/2009/10/5-voices-on-climate-
change.html)“. In it he sampled views from five global leaders. In his opening
remarks, he talked about the significance of [Blog Action
Day](http://www.blogactionday.org/about/en) and how “the phenomenon of climate
has engaged the world's attention over the past decade, provoking debates in
science, politics, business and technology.” The five global leaders he
discussed were [former US Vice-President Al
Gore](http://www.laurentian.ca/Laurentian/Home/Research/Special+Projects/Climate+Change+Case+Study/Quotes/Quotes.htm?Laurentian_Lang=en-
CA), [Nobel Laureate Wangari
Maathai](http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS199415+22-Sep-2008+BW20080922),
[US President Barack Obama](http://www.finestquotes.com/select_quote-category-
Global%20Warming-page-1.htm), [former UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan](http://www.environmental-
expert.com/resulteachpressrelease.aspx?cid=35992&codi=71576), [former Cuban
President Fidel
Castro](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/sep/24/barack-obama-
fidel-castro-climate-change).

Gameli ended his post with a series of questions—”What are your views on
climate change? Is it for real? Is it a myth? In what ways do you think that
the world can use its resources more sustainably? Can developing countries
contribute to reversing climate change?”—to which he hopes to get to answers
to soon.

Next to post on Blog Action Day was [The African Women’s Development
Fund](http://africanwomensdevelopmentfund.blogspot.com/) (AWDF) whose
contributors are AWDF, Bisi and Roselyn. Their post related to “[Climate
Change and
Women](http://africanwomensdevelopmentfund.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-action-
day-climate-change-and.html)“.
[AWDF](http://africanwomensdevelopmentfund.blogspot.com/) is an Africa-wide
grant-making foundation for African Women. The vision of the AWDF is for
African women to live in a world in which there is social justice, equality
and respect for women’s human rights.

They started their post by taking issue with statements made by [Arun
Agrawal](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~arunagra/) in his paper on Social
Dimensions of Climate Change, which was prepared for the Social Development
Department, The World Bank, Washington DC, March 5-6, 2008. In his paper,
Agrawal stated that “climate change will be pivotal in redefining development
in the twenty-first century. How nations, societies, communities, and
households respond to the impacts of climate changes and variability to which
the world has already been committed will in many instances determine their
prospects for growth, equity, and sustainability”.

AWDF views climate change as an environmental change, which is also driven by
humans—fundamentally a human problem. The impacts of climate change are
expected to seriously (and disproportionately) affect the livelihoods, health,
and educational opportunities of people living in poverty. AWDF also made a
few recommendations for dealing with the situation.

Kajsa Hallberg Adu, co-founder of [Ghana Blogging
Group](http://www.ghanablogging.com/) and author of the [Rain In
Africa](http://nonjeneregretterien.blogspot.com/) blog, [had a lot to say on
Blog Action Day](http://nonjeneregretterien.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-action-
day-climate-change.html), but was shocked at “how **not** current the topic is
in Ghana”. Kajsa laments the absence of Ghana from a web site counting down to
the UN Climate Change Summit and asks: “Really, when was the last time you
heard someone discuss climate change around here?”

Yet Ghana came in for some special praise from Kasja:

> A way to globally reduce the carbon dioxide emissions is to make sure we
> travel with public transport rather than individually in our own cars.
> Today, many Ghanaians travel in packed trotros, shared taxis or “Kufuor
> busses” and hence do not emit too much CO2. Can we say the same about the
> North/West? But as Ghanaians grow richer – our goal is to become a middle
> income country as soon as possible – more Ghanaians can also afford their
> own cars.
>
> In my opinion the problem in the discussion about climate change is that
> while developed countries are struggling to be sustainable, developing
> countries are already klimatsmarta, but not by choice. Rather the
> “environmental consciousness” or sustainable living is caused by last year's
> topic; poverty.

Finally, Edward Tagoe, author of [Tagoe
Blogger](http://tagoeblogger.blogspot.com/) blog and also a software
developer-cum-poet, decided to share with his readers an interesting website
called [YOURENEW.COM](http://yourenew.com/). [According
to](http://tagoeblogger.blogspot.com/2009/10/getting-paid-to-save-world.html)
Edward, the site “is the perfect place for you to recycle or sell used cell
phones, mp3 players, digital cameras and graphing calculators. You can also
recycle and sell laptops, video game console, external hard drive, video game
or DVD. If you can’t find your device in our catalogue or we can’t pay for it,
you can always ship it for free and we’ll recycle it safely. So look up your
device today, go green and get green! So look up your device today and go
green!”

Also take note, October 24th, 2009 has been designated the International Day
of Climate Action by [350.org](http://www.350.org "350.org").
