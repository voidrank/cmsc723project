[Malév](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malév_Hungarian_Airlines), Hungary's
state airline since 1946, ceased operation on February 3, 2012, due to
bankruptcy. According to [news
reports](http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/2012/02/03/vege_a_malevnak_lealltak_a_gepei/)
[hu], even the airline's employees were informed about the shutdown just an
hour or so in advance. Some passengers learned the news when they tried to
check in at the Budapest Liszt Ferenc Airport.

Hungarian citizens were shocked by the news, because even though the national
carrier’s bad financial situation was well-known, [Malév's rescue plans were
being negotiated](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-02/hungary-s-malev-
seeks-plan-to-keep-flying-as-state-cash-runs-out.html) during the past few
weeks. Many claimed the cause of the company's ill fate was bad financial
management. In January, even the 2007-2010 state financial aid to the airline
[was deemed illegal](http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/ec-orders-
struggling-malev-to-pay-back-illegal-state-aid-366672/) by the European
Commission. Eventually, business partners lost their trust in the company, and
this tipped the balance on Friday when Dublin and Tel Aviv airports [refused

to Malév flights.

According to [A REPÜLÉS Szakmai blog](http://arepules.blogspot.com/2012/02/az-
utolso-malev-gep-atrepulesek.html) (THE AVIATION Professional blog) [hu], the
last Malév flight landed in Budapest on Friday at 08:46 UTC (09:46 AM in
Hungary), arriving from Helsinki. The words that the pilot said to the air
traffic controllers have been shared by Hungarian netizens on many sound- and
video-sharing sites:

> Pilot: On behalf of the last Malév flight’s crew, we would like to thank you
> for the good, several-decade-long cooperation. See you.  
>  Air Traffic Controller: We also thank you and wish you a good rest, I hope
> we will meet.  
>  Pilot: Hope so, under some different name.

[According to AIRportal.hu](http://www.airportal.hu/spotter-
forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=6582) [hu], on Friday evening 14 Malév planes were
returned to their lessor ILFC at an airport in Ireland. (See here for Malcolm
Nason's [photos of the Malév
planes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/shanair/6816518003/) at Shannon Airport
in Ireland.)

Csaba Demeter, a pilot who was among those flying the planes back, shared his
story [on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=364694876891940&id=100000542920624)
[hu]:

> […] Around midnight we arrived to EINN [airport code for Shannon Airport,

> the past period. We stopped one after another, on rolling-roads, on parking
> spaces, we stopped them, unpacked and turned off the lights, our planes were

People shared their thoughts on the sad fate of the national carrier. Csaba’s
memories on [Fékszárny
blog](http://fekszarny.blog.hu/2012/02/04/in_memoriam_malev_997) [hu] tell the
best what Malév meant for the citizens of this small Central European country:

> I flew a lot with them, I have many good and many bad experiences as well. I
> wouldn’t tell about those because there is nothing special among them. Why I
> very much loved to fly with Malév and it always enjoyed priority in contrast
> to the others is that they were OURS. After being away from home for a long
> time they were the first signs of coming home. The mentioned white-blue
> painting with the Hungarian tricolor, the greeting at the door and the
> Hungarian newspapers. I usually spent 2-3 weeks abroad and not in cities and
> comfortable hotels, but in deserts and other great places. So coming home
> was always a big joy and its first messenger was the crew of the Malév
> flight. After a long, stressful trip even my eyes filled with tears when
> landing at the Ferihegy [airport]. It was a very bad [feeling] to look at
> the pictures and read the news on the internet. Let’s hope not all is lost,
> it would be good to see the red-white-green planes again.

[According to Véleményvezér
blog](http://velemenyvezer.blog.hu/2012/02/07/malev_mit_veszitettunk_el_valojaban?)
[hu], the national carrier “got into the perfect storm” of Hungary's economic
dynamics:

> […] Malév got into the perfect storm from this perspective: it should have
> survived almost a decade of economic stagnation and almost a decade of
> mismanagement; whilst the two phenomena amplified each other. It did not
> survive and this is yet another nail in the coffin of our dreams and
> illusions about the leading position of Budapest and Hungary in the region.

Until a new Hungarian carrier is founded, Origo news site
[reports](http://www.origo.hu/techbazis/20120203-a-kiberterben-tovabbra-is-
repul-a-malev.html) [hu] the pilots of the “[Malév Hungarian Airlines
Virtual](http://www.virtualairlines.hu/vaos.php?lang=eng)” will keep on
“[flying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator)” with the
Malév call signs.
