Uruguay is experiencing, as it does every 5 years, an electoral process that
will be decided on [Sunday, October
25](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_general_election,_2009). However,
if one candidate does not receive the majority of votes, then a run-off
election will take place on the last Sunday in November. This is part of a
busy 12 months in the electoral calendar in Uruguay, as “internal elections”
or party elections took place last June, followed by the presidential
elections, and municipal elections in May 2010.

There are many political parties in contention, but the list is reduced when
referring to the parties that really have the chance to gain, at least one,
parliamentary seat. These parties include the [National
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_%28Uruguay%29) (White
Party), considered to be one of the traditional parties and is the main
opponent of the current government. Others include the [Broad
Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Front_%28Uruguay%29), which is the
current government, and is considered to left-leaning and can also be
considered to be a “traditional” party, despite being a young party.

The major contenders for the presidential seat are considered to be the Broad
Front and the National Party. One of the major candidates is already well-
known to Uruguayans. [Dr. Luis A.
Lacalle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alberto_Lacalle), the National
Party candidate, was President of Uruguay from 1999-2004 and is considered to
be a major rival for the Broad Front.

On the other hand, their candidate is a very colorful figure, who is often
seen far from typical political protocol or convention. [José “El Pepe”
Mujica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mujica) has had a history with
the National Liberation Movement
“[Tupamaros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupamaro)” in the 1960s, where he
participated in guerrilla operations, arrested 4 times, and twice escaped from
the Punta Carretas prison. In all, Mujica spent 15 years of his life in jail,
with his last period of detention being between 1972-1985. When the military
dictatorship ended, and democracy returned to the country, Mujica changed his
weapons, and has been a deputy and a senator. In the current government, he
was the Minister of Livestock and Agriculture.

The blogger Jorge Oyhenard [takes a look at how various candidates are using
the internet to spread their campaign
[es]](http://www.jorgeoyhenard.com/elecciones-en-uruguay-2009-candidatos-en-
internet/1333/). He notes that most parties and candidates have their own
website, but they have yet to maximize the use of web 2.0 and social
networking sites.

With the stage set, there are few topics of discussion. Public security is a
concern due to the wave of crime over the past few years, as well as the issue
of taxes. However, the current campaign is [already filled with usual campaign
rhetoric](http://uyelecciones2009.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-una-sugerencia-
despolitizada.html) as the blog _Uy Elecciones [es]_ describes:

> Si un marciano encayara en Uruguay (podría ser en otros muchos países) y lee
> los programas de gobierno de los (o escucha a los) diferentes partidos
> políticos se encontraría con una grata sorpresa: a todos ahora les importa
> la justicia social (planes para ayudar a los más desfavorecidos, educación y
> salud más equitativas, etc.), alguna que otra cosa del medio ambiente, los
> beneficios para los pasivos (y si, hay que nombrarlos que cada vez son más),
> la transparencia (a esta altura ésta podría ser ya una política de Estado,
> todos la apoyan (que bueno, no?)).  
>  Y así estamos; esas “semejanzas” condimentadas con la publicidad medio-
> masiva moderna electoral crean como una nube gris, en la cual es
> comprensible caer en la de “son todo lo mismo”.

If a Martian landed on Uruguay (or in other countries) and reads the
governmental proposals from the (or hears from) different political party,
then he would find a pleasant surprise” now everyone cares about social
justice (plans to help the most unfortunate, fairer education and health,
etc.), as well as the environment, benefits for those who have retired (and
yes, one must name those that are more each day), transparency (at this point
this could already be State policy, everyone supports it, that is good,
right?) There we have it; these similarities flavored with the modern
electoral mass-media publicity creates a gray cloud, in which it is
understandable to fall in the way of thinking that “they are all the same.”
