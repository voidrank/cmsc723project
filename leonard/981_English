European students plan green solidarity photo shoot

The Iranian opposition has planned a large demonstration for Monday, December
7 as Iran marks the annual [Students
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Day_\(Iran\)), commemorating the
assassination of three students in 1953.

Opposition groups have[ warned

demonstrators that they are likely to meet a tough response from the security
forces.

The Iranian ‘green’ movement have already taken advantage of a number of
state-sponsored events such as “[Quds Day](../2009/09/18/iran-videos-from-
quds-day-protests/)” to organise demonstrations. [According to
](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hKTpGMkExrdIvBar7wIJIzLv77kw)media
on Sunday most of Tehran's Internet links were down in what sources close to
Iran's technical services said was “a decision by the authorities” rather than
a breakdown.

_Mojtaba Saminejad_ , blogger and human rights activist, [writes

> As 7th of December [16th of Azar] approaches, arresting students and

Several citizens around the world have used YouTube to support Iranian
protesters such as this woman from Germany who says that on December 7, ‘My
heart is with you until you become free.’

Iranian citizens have launched _Divarnevisi_ (meaning ‘writing on the wall’) a
website where they publish posters, teach others how to write slogans in the
street, and share the photos of the slogans and pamphlets from different
cities of Iran.

We can find several examples of posters for December 7. Here is one example
where we can see the photos of Iranians like
[Neda](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/24/iran-neda-becomes-a-symbol-
for-the-protesters/) who were killed after 12th of June election by the
security forces.
