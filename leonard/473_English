The Indigenous [Huicholes (also known as
Wixarika)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huichol) People from Mexico are
denouncing a Canadian mining project that is threatening one of their sacred
sites. They attended the [United Nations Climate Change Conference-
COP16](http://www.cc2010.mx/en/) in Cancun in order to [express their concerns
about the Canadian mining concessions,](http://redroadcancun.com/?p=1380) as
blogger BJM writes on the Indigenous Environmental Network blog _[Red Road
Cancun:](http://redroadcancun.com/)_

> A delegation of Mexican Indians came to Cancun to denounce the transnational
> mining project by Canadian First Majestic Silver in an Wirikuta protected
> natural area.
>
> This place is sacred to the Huichol Indians who come to the site located in
> the semi desert of Real de Catorce. This is one of the principal centers of
> prayer for the Wixarica pueblo of Huichol people located in the highlands of
> San Luis Potosi.

On the same issue, author Tracy L. Barnett from the digital newspaper _[The
Esperanza Project](http://theesperanzaproject.org/)_ wrote[ an article on the
importance of this land](http://theesperanzaproject.org/2010/12/from-sierra-
to-sea-huicholes-make-their-mark-in-cancun/) for the Wixarika, as well as on
the annual pilgrimage they make:

> We were there, primarily, to get the word out about the Canadian silver
> mining operation that is poised to break ground in Wirikuta, the most sacred
> site of the Wixarika people, the place where, according to their tradition,
> the sun was born. This site is in some ways the center of their universe,
> the destination of an annual pilgrimage conducted for hundreds, perhaps
> thousands of years, which culminates in a series of ceremonies convoking the
> ancestral spirits and balancing the energies of the entire planet. First
> Majestic Silver Corp. of Canada has been granted 22 mining concessions, for
> a total of 6,326 hectares, much of which lies in a federally protected
> ecological reserve and the UNESCO-recognized architectural treasure of Real
> de Catorce.

The online journal _[Intercontinental Cry](http://intercontinentalcry.org/)_
published [a post](http://intercontinentalcry.org/indigenous-wixarika-people-
demand-a-moratorium-on-mining/) on the Wixarika's demands concerning the
Wirikuta site, a sacred place for natives of Mexico, and the actions they are
willing to take:

> The sanctity of Wirikuta is the Wixarika's Peoples biggest concern; however,
> they also point out that some 3500 people are living in the concession area,
> in 16 population centres and “numerous localities”. If the silver mine
> becomes operational, each and every one may be facing water shortages and
> moderate to severe health problems from the company's use of
> [cyanide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning). Exposure to
> cyanide may cause blurred vision, severe shortness of breath, headaches and
> general weakness as well as paralysis, cardiac arrest, seizures and death.
>
> For these reasons, the Wixarika say they are prepared to “use all the
> resources necessary to stop this devastating mining project, making use of
> national and international legal resources that are in our favor as well as
> non-violent actions of civil protest that are necessary.”

_[Cultural Survival](http://www.culturalsurvival.org/)_ posted [background
information ](http://www.culturalsurvival.org/take-action/mexico/background-
information)on possible problems if the project continues:

> If this huge project is allowed to move forward, its impacts will be equally
> huge. Whether they dig the ore out of tunnels or excavate open pits, the
> mine will produce enormous quantities of tailings that could leach acid into
> the environment for centuries and blight the landscape in a region whose
> primary source of income is tourism. Dust, noise, erosion, road
> construction, water pollution, and blasting all affect wildlife, and the
> region’s notable diversity of bird species—including 16 that are
> threatened—could plummet. Of most concern to the region’s peasant farmers is
> the mine’s potential impact on the water table in this semi-desert. Mines of
> this size use as much water in a day as a peasant family would use in 25
> years.

_Cultural Survival_ also [offers different ways to take action to help and
raise awareness about the topic](http://www.culturalsurvival.org/take-
action/mexico/background-information), as well as ideas on how to act through
online activism.
