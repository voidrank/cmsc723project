precautions](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/fortress-delhi-gears-up-for-
the-2010-cwg/132224-3.html?from=tn) the 2010 Commonwealth Games officially
begins today in New Delhi, India. [The Commonwealth
Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_games) is a multi-sport event
which is held every four years since 1930 between the athletes of members of
the [Commonwealth of
Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations). For the first
time this event is being hosted by India, and surprisingly it was subject to
much [criticism and
controversy](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/02/india.commonwealth.games/index.html)
from early on.

The preparations of the Commonwealth Games 2010 have been marred by a number
of security and infrastructural problem including accusations of corruption,
and these were widely discussed in the media and in the blogosphere. Moreover,
a citizens group called ‘Anti Commonwealth Games Front’ [organized
protests](http://www.sacw.net/article1592.html) against this event citing many
irregularities, including:

>   * Human rights violation of the urban poor by eviction and rendering
> 200000 people homeless.
>   * Destitute persons (‘beggars’) have been arrested and sent back to their
> home states.
>   * Migrant workers have been threatened and terrorized to leave the city.
>   * 300,000 street vendors have already lost their livelihoods to the Games.

_Prerna_ from Delhi [criticizes](http://pr3rna.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/the-
nation-is-divided-half-patriots-and-half-traitors-and-no-man-can-tell-which-
from-which/) the tendency of her countrymen and the media to exaggerate the
facts:

> These happenings are very bad and nobody can deny that. However what is
> bothering me more than this is, that it seems to have become a national
> pastime to exaggerate everything that is going wrong with the games
> preparation. No time is wasted to proclaim that the games will be an abject
> failure. One athlete withdraws from the games and it is shown over and over
> again making it seem like majority of athletes have decided to stay back.
>
> The Organising Committee of the Commonwealth Games 2010 has left a blot on
> the India’s image and the allegations of misuse of funds speak volumes of
> the inept handling of the whole affair. But the way a few sections of the
> Indian media has reacted seems like they are working on an agenda.

She asserts what needs to be done to tackle the problem:

> Simply spreading negativity isn’t the answer and we all need to try and
> support India in ensuring the success of the games. About security issues,
> we can and have managed that and the proof is that we have organised cricket
> world cups and IPL tournaments successfully.

Not only in India, there are a lot of reports in International media about the
mismanagement and corruption in the building up of this event and some
journalists have devised innovative ways to undermine the preparations by
Indian authorities. _Cafe Pyala_
[exposes](http://cafepyala.blogspot.com/2010/09/blowing-up-story.html) a TV
report which shows that an Australian Channel 7 reporter smuggled explosives
into the games athlete's village to show the weak security standards at the
venue:

> It reverberated across the world, and added to the chorus of voices
> demanding that the Games be cancelled. Well, as the Australian Broadcasting
> Corporation's well-respected [MediaWatch programme
> reveals](http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3023099.htm), the
> story was not all it was cracked up to be.
>
> If you watch/read no other media take down this week, [do watch
> this](http://rajeev2004.blogspot.com/2010/10/aussie-journalist-tries-to-
> malign.html) to understand how media reports can be manipulated, to
> devastating effect.

_Beyond Cynical_ at _Desicritics_ , however, [takes the criticism
well](http://desicritics.org/2010/09/27/073153.php) and hopes that India has
learnt its lessons and should move forward without repetition of the same
errors:

> The CWG just projected us Indians in terms of the un-imaginable corruption
> level on the world platform. When the world discovered this just recently we
> were aware of it from ages and did nothing about it. Hence we learned this
> lesson the bitter way. Because this is an international event, all the dirt
> came out in the open and people started washing their dirty linen in public
> to protect their own ass.

_A Journey_ [has high
hopes](http://myimprints.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/common-wealth-games-day-
zero/) for India in this event:

> The hosting of Commonwealth Games would surely position the nation as a
> ‘capable’ country with immense potential. During the course of this journey
> of spectacular sporting event, we would keep a close watch on the sporting
> events and the response of the world on the way India does it.
