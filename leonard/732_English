Francophone Africa is celebrating 50 years of independence in 2010. In light
of this anniversary, a [summit Africa-
France](http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/01/25th-africa-france-summit-
ends-tuesday-in-nice/) took place in Nice, France as the oft tumultuous
relationship between France and its former colonies was again under the
spotlight. Many Africans voices are wondering out loud what is there to
celebrate, given the mediocre level of human development achieved in many
countries since independence.  
The recurrent lament of those many outraged voices is that the African
continent is certainly rich in natural resources and yet, it seems that the
continent is endlessly plagued with what is known as the resource curse and
many believe that those foreign interests are no stranger to sustaining the
curse.  
From an economic standpoint, Africa has certainly benefited from the boom in
commodities in the last decade but not as much as one would predict. A report
for Mckinsey Quarterly entitled [“What drives Africa's
growth?”](http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Economic_Studies/Productivity_Performance/Whats_driving_Africas_growth_2601?gp=1),
the authors state that:

> Oil rose from less than $20 a barel in 1999 to more than $145 in 2008.
> prices for minerals, grain and other raw materials also soared on rising
> global demand. [..] Yet natural resources generated only 32% of Africa's GDP
> growth from 2000 to 2008.

So why has Africa not benefited more from its resources? Many Africans would
argue that the way international interests are involved and mixed in the
exploitation of those resources and the lack of transparency regarding those
deals do not help foster development for African states. In a dossier on
FranceAfrique for Focus on Africa , Stephen Smith [highlights the special
ties](http://www.bbc.co.uk/focusonafricamagazine/news/story/2010/04/100429_france_africa.shtml)
between France and the continent:

> But since he took office, President Sarkozy has perpetuated France's time-
> honoured tradition of parallel diplomacy in Africa.  
>  One set of advisers presides in public over the official business with
> Africa, while high-ranking Elysee staff, in tandem with unofficial
> middlemen, is in charge of the lucrative and highly personalised politics
> that Mr Sarkozy denounced during his presidential campaign.  
>  The French media regularly expose the broken promises and the new lease on
> life given to Francafrique.  
>  The elite collusion of Francafrique has become an anachronism, at odds with
> the stark realities of shrinking French engagement – both government and
> private – with its former territories south of the Sahara.

The oil curse is the most cited issues in the francophone regions but
certainly not the only one. In a recent report for the Africa report, Norbrook
wonders [who really owns Africa’s oil](http://www.theafricareport.com/special-
reports/sector-reports/oil-a-gas/3286482-who-owns-africas-oil-.html):

> This brave new world for African oil has been driven by price hikes, which
> make the expensive process of exploring a risk worth taking. The move
> offshore, enabled by advances in technology, requires deep pockets – hiring
> the drill boat that discovered oil in Ghana cost about a million dollars a
> day.  
>  Another important dynamic has been the multiplication of competition, with
> Chinese and Indian companies joining the European and US array of majors.
> Where oil production was traditionally controlled by a small elite whose
> monopoly was seen as unhealthy, new challengers have made it easier for
> governments to negotiate terms.

Blogger _Achille_ in Antananarivo, Madagascar has been following the political
crisis in Madagascar closely, here is[ how he links the turmoil there and the
oil curse](http://reflexiums.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/madagascar-maudit-
petrole) (fr):

> On a tous cherché la cause de cette crise, mais on oublie que c’est le

> qu’enfin la stupidité avait enfin atteint son sommet avec nos dirigeants.

We have all been seeking the cause of this crisis, yet we often forget that
oil is what triggered all of the turmoil. All the other events, pillaging the
national forest, high crimes, the ever-increasing poverty are only the
byproducts of that. Lobbyists for Francafrique only started to make their move
when they heard that there was oil to be exploited, not discarding the fact
that other resources were also attractive to them and other nations.  
In fact, I just realize that we are surrounded by corporations, Canadians in
the South, Chinese in Soalala and of course Total, every developing country
and wannabe dictators’ best friend. In the meantime, we are just standing
here, watching our resources being shipped to far away places ! When I saw
that 100 millions were granted for an oil concession, I said to myself that
stupidity has finally reached its peak with our leaders.

Back in the 70’s, oil was seen as a passport towards rapid development. That
was the case for Algeria, Libya and Irak says _Passion-histoire_. He explains
how quickly that [hope has now faded away](http://blog.passion-
histoire.net/?p=6106) (fr):

> Dans les années 1970, grâce la rente pétrolière, l’Algérie, la Libye et
> l’Irak paraissaient engagés dans un processus de modernisation accélérée. Le
> pétrole était la bénédiction qui permettrait à ces États de rattraper leur «
> retard » économique.  
>  L’Algérie était un « dragon en Méditerranée », la Libye un « émirat » et
> l’Irak « la puissance militaire montante » du monde arabe. Sur le plan
> politique, le socialisme progressiste laissait penser que des
> transformations profondes s’opéraient : émancipation de la femme,
> urbanisation, scolarisation, augmentation de l’espérance de vie…  
>  Quelques décennies plus tard, la désillusion est cruelle. Le sentiment de
> richesse a entraîné ces pays dans des expérimentations voire des impasses
> politiques, économiques et militaires aux conséquences désastreuses dont ils
> peinent encore à sortir.

In the 1970, thanks to petrol rent, Algeria, Libya and Irak looked like they
were engaged in a rapid modernization process. Petrol was the blessing that
would allow this states to catch up from an economic standpoint. Algeria was
to the “Mediterranean Dragon”, Libya was the “Emirate”, and Irak was “ the
rising military power” of the arab world. From a political standpoint,
progressive socialism would let many believe that many deep transformational
change were in the works, women empowerment, urbanization, schooling, rising
life expectancy…  
A few decades later, the disillusion cuts deep. The feeling is that those
riches led those countries to try out experiments that led to political
economical and military dead ends that had disastrous consequences from which
they have a devil of a time trying to escape.

Reacting on the celebration of 50 years of independence, _Faustine Vincent_
writes that African nations are [reluctant to submit their report
card](http://www.20minutes.fr/article/405796/Monde-Les-50-ans-d-independances-
africaines-embarrassent.php) (fr):

> Mais, au final, le cinquantenaire embarrasse tout le monde. Côté africain,
> «les pays auraient dû en profiter pour faire un bilan d’étape. Ce n’est pas
> le cas, assure Boubacar Boris Diop, écrivain sénégalais. Certainement parce
> qu’ils n’ont pas lieu d’en être fiers».

In the end, this 50 year anniversary celebration is quite embarrassing for
everyone. From the African side, “this was an opportunity to draw conclusions
from their journeys so far. However, that is far from the being the case says
Boubacar Boris Diop, a Sengalese writer. They certainly don’t have anything to
be proud of”.

On the French side, the Sarkozy administration used to express a willingness
to do away with the practices of former French administrations. As reported by
_Sarah Halifa-Legrand_ , this [was expressed in rather crude terms by Alain
Joyandet](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/dossier/afrique-50-ans-d-
independance/20100528.OBS4588/la-francafrique-version-sarkozy.html), Secretary
of State for French Cooperation (fr):

> …[La France] se montrant “prêt à laisser tomber l’Afrique si son pays n’y
> trouve pas son compte”. Dans la bouche d’Alain Joyandet, cela donne : “Ne
> pas avoir peur de dire aux Africains qu’on veut les aider, mais qu’on veut
> aussi que cela nous rapporte”

[France] is ready to “give up on Africa if the country does not find it
worthwhile”. From the mouth of Alain Joyandet: “ Not to be afraid to tell
Africans that we want to help them but there has got to be something in it for
us as well”

In Gabon, _Association Survie_ notes that despite last year’s turmoil in
Gabon, the [company Total has done quite well for itself in
2010](http://survie.org/billets-d-afrique/2010/192-juin-2010/article/total-
gabon-profite-de-la-hausse):

> Elle a publié un résultat net de 42 millions d’euros au titre du premier
> trimestre 2010, en hausse de 109% par rapport à la même période en 2009.

Total has reported a net benefit of 42 millions euros in the first trimester
of 2010, that is an increase of 109% from the same period in 2009.

Finally, _Arimi Choubadé_ at Quotidien Nokoue in Benin posts a sarcastic note
asking us to imagine how better-off France would have been if only [France
could have “maintained” her privileged ties with countries that have major
natural assets](http://quotidiennokoue.com/?p=3615) (fr):

> Imaginez une France partenaire privilégié d’une Côte d’Ivoire forte de son
> cacao ; d’un Gabon, d’un Congo, d’un Tchad, d’un Cameroun voire d’une
> Mauritanie dopés par l’exploitation du pétrole ; d’un Mali, d’un Bénin et
> d’un Burkina Faso en pôle dans la production de coton ; d’un Togo
> transfiguré par les ristournes du phosphate; et d’un Niger comblé par
> l’exploitation de l’Uranium. Cela éviterait à Sarkozy sa posture actuelle de
> puissance mitigée.

Imagine France with a privileged partnership with Ivory Coast and its
abundance of cocoa; with Gabon, Congo, Chad, Cameroon even Mauritania boosted
with oil; with Mali, Benin and Burkina Faso and their cotton, with Togo
transformed by its phosphate and with Niger, and its uranium reserve. It could
have helped Sarkozy from having to deal with its position as just a middle-of-
the-pack powerhouse.
