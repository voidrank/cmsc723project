There are many reasons small-scale farmers in developing countries need
special attention. They grow a good portion of the planet’s food while
suffering potential environmental and economic catastrophe. They also provide
a large amount of jobs. Farmers and their families are often located far from
population centers, making trips to the market, the school or the hospital
difficult.

With so many local, regional and international development organizations
working with farmers, the possibilities for information and communication
technologies (ICTs), are great. Still, the question remains: Can these
technologies live up to the hype and actually help raise human development
levels?

One point of optimism lies at the heart of Web 2.0 technologies or “the
participatory web” according to a 2008 report by Annemarie Matthess and
Christian Kreutz for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development, called [“Participatory Web – New Potentials of ICT in Rural
Areas” [PDF]](http://www.crisscrossed.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/the-
participatory-web.pdf). They write:

> The participatory web offers new ways to translate and bridge language
> domains. Users publish themselves and can engage in a dialogue. One such
> result is that knowledge becomes more explicit – bridges are built between
> the local and global knowledge. Worldwide agriculture research cooperation
> has a long experience in this field and results show how difficult it is to
> translate global scientific knowledge to the local context.

For all the great potential of ICTs in rural areas, Tanzanian-based journalist
Emmanuel Onyangoin in his blog _Knowledge Matters_
[warns](http://eonyango.blogspot.com/2009/11/bringing-ict-tarinings-for-
rural.html) the challenges facing technologies in rural areas remain high:

> Studies shows that, rural farmers do not have direct access to the internet
> in rural areas pending on a number of factors. The basic ones being the
> increased computer illiteracy among users and an unreliable infrastructure
> such as electricity.

**Wikis and scientific information**

One popular method to increase farmer productivity is through wikis, the often
plain-vanilla collaborative websites that provide easy editing features, made
popular by sites like [_Wikipedia_](http://wikipedia.org).

Wikis are an easy way to exchange ideas over the web, allowing people in
different locations to write, edit and disseminate documents on low-bandwidth
sites. Wikis can be used with other platforms, such as maps or photographs,
not only to collect data but also enabling users to participate in vetting the
information.

![Sharing Knowledge Tag Cloud](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/11/Sharing-Knowledge-Tag-Cloud-300x99.jpg)

One such wiki is the _[Knowledge Sharing Toolkit](http://www.kstoolkit.org/)_
of the [Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research
(CGIAR)](http://www.cgiar.org/who/index.html) and the [UN Food and Agriculture
Organization](”http://www.fao.org/”), which allows people in laboratories and
those working in the field to disseminate a wide-range of information that can
be constantly updated, amended and assessed.

The _Communication Initiative Network_
[explains](http://www.comminit.com/en/node/281774) that the _Knowledge
Sharing_ toolkit has three main pieces:

> 1\. A library of tools, meaning web-based software (e.g., blogs, wikis,
> instant messengers, podcasting) and offline physical tools that can be used
> with a variety of methods.  
>  2\. A library of methods, meaning group processes that people can use to
> interact with each other, online or offline (e.g., appreciative inquiry,
> storytelling, knowledge fairs).  
>  3\. A set of perspectives and guidance that can help users choose tools and
> methods for their needs and contexts. Some examples: How can I organise
> meetings differently? How can I plan, monitor, and evaluate my
> activities/projects? How can I improve relationships and collaboration
> between regional offices and the headquarters?

The _Knowledge Sharing Toolkit_ [began](http://www.ks-
cgiar.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=120&Itemid=126) as a means
to keep up with the explosion in scientific knowledge, which has been
facilitated by the expansion of the internet and peoples’ increasing access to
information. The libraries are not written for scientists, however. Rather,
generalists can update their basic skills so they can better communicate with
scientists, funders, partners in the field or immediately leverage new ideas
in their communities.

**Maps and food security**

It’s been argued that one of the major components of food security is getting
produce to market. Bad roads and poor transportation infrastructure are often
the culprits. To solve some of these issues at the local level is
[iMMAP](http://immap.org/index.php), which began using GIS technology more
than a decade ago to locate landmines. They’ve moved on to help guide crisis
responders in a number of different countries.

From the _ICT-KM_ blog at Cgiar, a new project is
[explained](http://ictkm.cgiar.org/2009/10/29/mapping-the-roads-less-
travelled/).

> Throughout most of the developing world, there is a real and urgent need for
> roads data. Road location and attribute information can play a vital role in
> long term development applications and also help humanitarian agencies with
> short term emergency and logistical planning. Despite this dire need,
> though, popular web mapping service applications have not explored the roads
> less travelled in much of the developing world. No tourists, no maps!

From that blog post, a question and answer session took place with Olivier
Cottray, who
[spoke](http://immap.org/index.php?option=com_fjrelated&view=fjrelated&layout=blog&id=109&Itemid=79_)
about gRoads, an Ethiopian-based project mapping roads with GPS-enabled PDA
devices and how it will support local farmers.

> The rationale of the project in the context of farming is that the better
> roads data will help agencies and organizations that are supporting farmers
> to look at accessibility to markets. Location information is also being
> collected for infrastructure of importance to small holder farmers such as
> irrigation equipment; water reservoirs; community grain storage or
> fertilizer warehouses; and agricultural extension offices.

**Video and overcoming low literacy**

Some practitioners argue that video blogging is one way to overcome a few of
the hurdles facing ICT technologies in rural areas. By posting video or audio
files, bloggers immediately overcome literacy issues. Also, they can speak
directly by using local languages that may not be common on the internet.

Brenda Zulu, in her blog, _ICT Journalist_ ,
[investigates](http://brendait.blogspot.com/2007/09/video-blooging-tool-for-
for-development.html) how video blogging works in Ghana with an interview with
Prince Deh, the Assistant Country Director of Ghana Information Network for
Knowledge Sharing (GINKS).

> Vlogging major challenges were listed as connectivity or access and getting
> people to share Information and Knowledge and cost of equipment.  
>  From my his own view, Deh said Web 2.0 tools were important and even more
> important because of the deeper impact the tools would have on marginalized
> societies, even if these impact are not immediately felt.  
>  He observed that many more rural communities have stories to share with the
> larger public and voices to amplify and saw Web 2.0 tools as perfect
> applications to project the voices of the rural poor in the future.
>
> “How do we solve the problem of rural connectivity in order to extend the
> benefits of Web2.0 tools much wider beyond the scope of the cities?” he
> asked.  
>  He pointed out that it was important to have knowledge of video editing and
> innovativeness in order to create story telling videos.

Deh says the images increase the popularity of video blogs because they make
them engaging. After filming a video, they can be embedded into a blog, so
people can comment on them.

Development groups like them because they are cheap to make and disseminate.
One popular [video](http://ictupdate.cta.int/en/Feature-Articles/No-time-to-
wait) from GINKS explained to farmers (in a local language) how to use their
mobile phone to get market information.

**Lessons Learned**

Throughout much of this [Future of ICT for Development
series](https://globalvoicesonline.org/-/special/ict-for-development/) on
Global Voices, I have strived to put forth a well rounded debate on the
positives and negatives of these technologies. Mostly I have tried to answer
whether ICTs can raise human development.

One drawback has been that it is hard for me to find those who are skeptical
or cynical regarding the potential of ICTs. I'd like to include these next
three comments solely for the purpose of debate. They happen to be a response
to a 2007 _[Web2forDev](http://blog.web2fordev.net/2007/09/25/is-the-
participatory-web-really-in-parallel-with-participatory-development/)_ blog
post regarding the participatory web and development. What makes them
interesting is that these comments provide healthy skepticism (if not
criticism) of ICTs affecting development levels in rural areas. I add these
comments not as a critique on the above projects; rather, I think ICTs as
tools of development need to be debated in the open.

The commenters pose a few questions: Are the stories presented in these blog
posts or series like this the norm or just an aberrations? What role, if any,
will ICTs play in raising living standards?

From _Pankaj Gupta_ :

> I think a lot is made of how ICTs can help in development and poverty
> reduction. I live in India, have worked extensively in participatory digital
> video and sustainability research, and travel a lot to the ‘poorest’
> districts of the country (that makes up nearly most of the country!) and can
> say with the confidence that comes from first hand observation that the poor
> are far far away from using the web. The examples are merely examples: rare
> exceptions that voluble techno-freaks amplify, only to mislead a lot of us
> into thinking that information technologies can do any good to the poor. If
> probed deeply, any of these examples would not pass the test of
> affordability or sustainability once the artificial support on which an
> experiment is flaunted is removed. People caught up in day-to-day survival
> have no inclination or energy or access to link up with the web and profit
> from it.

From _Andrea_ :

> I have been working extensively in Africa and I quite agree with you. I have
> seen very few villages with electricity, less with PCs and even less or none
> with internet connection but I think that this is also one of the thing we
> should still work on it.  
>  On the other hand I still see a huge potential for web 2.0 in Aid. Web 2.0
> has a strong potential for collaborative work and I think that international
> organisation should start using it as soon as possible.

From _Ignatia/Inge de Waard_

> I agree with both Andrea, Pankaj and [post writer]Holly that only a minority
> of people are connected in developing areas. But just like Andrea I believe
> in web2.0 as a strengthening evolution. Because of the participatory
> strength of web2.0, I believe that even if only a minority will use the
> participatory web, this will make a huge difference on developing areas. If
> any change can be done, change must be stimulated by those target people.
> Only by their knowledge essential changes will take effect.
