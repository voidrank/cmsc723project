Thailand’s Yellow Shirt protesters are
[back](http://www.thaiphotoblogs.com/index.php?blog=5&title=yellow-shirts-
back-at-government-house&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) in the streets. The group which
launched massive protest actions and invaded the country’s international
airport in 2008 is mobilizing again to condemn the ‘treason’ of government
officials who are accused of being unable to protect the country’s borders.

The [protesters](http://www.tannetwork.tv/tan/ViewData.aspx?DataID=1040168)
insist that Thailand is not being assertive enough in the [Preah
Vihear](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/07/20/cambodian-and-thai-bloggers-
on-disputed-preah-vihear-temple/) border dispute against Cambodia. Preah
Vihear is a historic temple in a location which is both being claimed by
Thailand and Cambodia.

The [Yellow
Shirts](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2008-special-
coverage/thailand-protests-2008/) are members of the People's Alliance for
Democracy (PAD). They are also seen as supporters of the current government
which rose to power in 2008. But today the Yellow Shirts are openly expressing
their criticism against the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.

The Yellow Shirts have been protesting for several days already. _Palm
Writings_ , on Facebook, describes the
[situation](http://www.facebook.com/PalmWritings/posts/197226456958803) in
Bangkok

> official attempts to negotiate.

The Yellow Shirts have filed a criminal suit against key government officials

The main rivals of the Yellow Shirts are the [Red
Shirts](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CBkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fglobalvoicesonline.org%2Fspecialcoverage%2Fthailand-

who have emerged as the main opposition protesters since 2009. The Red Shirts
have recently [gathered](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/11/thailand-
the-red-shirt-protesters-are-back/) tens of thousands of their members to
demand the resignation of the ‘undemocratic’ Abhisit government.

Will the Red and Yellow Shirts merge forces? Unlikely, according to political
observers

The PAD, it seems, has failed to attract a bigger number of rallyists

Even if it is unlikely, the tense situation could worsen if the Red and Yellow
Shirts will join forces

[Tai Hui](http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/01/27/guest-post-colour-blind-
investors-still-love-thailand%E2%80%99s-smile/) thinks that political rallies
won’t affect business investments

> Indeed, radical changes in the political landscape are a regular feature for
> Thailand and the economy has weathered such political storms pretty well in
> recent years. In its 78 years of democracy, Thailand has experienced 24

> foreign businesses, policy uncertainty is a greater worry than political
> instability
