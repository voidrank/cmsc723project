News organizations and people on the ground have
[reported](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/02/19/Report-84-dead-
in-Libyan-protests/UPI-90031298126238/) that Libya's army have shot at
demonstrators in Benghazi protesting against the 42-year-rule of Muammar Al
Gaddafi. Located 1,400km east of Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast, Benghazi
is the country’s second largest city.

**Updated** Scattered reports from Benghazi and in other parts of the country
show the death toll of protesters is rising. To keep up with protests in Libya

Rumors have spread that the government has used foreign mercenaries to attack
protesters. A video uploaded on You Tube Saturday, February 19 allegedly shows
Libyans carrying the body of a dead mercenary, whom they believe to be from
sub-Saharan Africa, possibly from Chad.

Earlier in the day, CNN's blog
[reported](http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/19/report-helicopters-fire-on-
libya-protesters/) a doctor told the news organization helicopters were flying
above demonstrations and had fired on demonstrators, injuring “dozens.”

It is impossible to verify reports on the ground. Reactions from Twitter are
taking place now in this very fluid situation:

On Friday, February 18, 2011, the Committee to Protect Journalists
[said](http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/journalists-targeted-in-bahrain-yemen-and-
libya.php) Libyan authorities blocked Al-Jazeera's website and jammed its
satellite transmission. The government also
[restricted](http://arabcrunch.com/2011/02/libya-blocks-facebook-twitter-and-
aljazeera-net.html) access to Facebook and Twitter. Foreign Policy
[reported](http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/02/18/radio_free_benghazi)
protesters took over a radio station.

This video, uploaded Friday, February 18, shows protests in Benghazi against
the regime of Muammar Al Gaddafi.

Al Jazeera English uploaded this video of protesters in Benghazi during the
night of February 18.

Libyans have been protesting for five days, since February , against
[President Gaddafi](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Muammar_al-
Gaddafi) and his government. Protests began with demonstrations against what
protesters described as the country's [corrupt
rulers.](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/16/libya-protests-against-
gaddafi-start-ahead-of-schedule/)

Stay tuned for more coverage from Libya.
