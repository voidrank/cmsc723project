Malaysia’s northern states of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan have been recently
hit by floods, causing approximately 40,000 people to evacuate their homes.

The state of Kedah has been the worst hit, and blogger Noor Azlina Abdul Samad
K, herself an evacuee, [wrote](http://piecesoflin.blogspot.com/2010/11/life-
goes-on.html):

> We had to make the decision to leave our house at night last Wednesday
> because the flood water was just a few feet away from entering our house.
> They had cut the water supply to the whole neighbourhood that day and was
> about to cut the electric supply too that night. So we knew we had to get
> out as fast as possible. Me, my Mom and my Aunt quickly packed our bags and
> did what we can to save our belongings and place them at a higher place in

The Ti-Ratana Penchala Community Centre, [wrote in their
blog](http://trccpenchala.blogspot.com/2010/11/help-needed-for-flood-victims-
in-kedah.html) their mission to help the flood victims:

Blogger Shanmugam Lakshmanan managed to [inject some
humour](http://shanmugamlakshmanan.blogspot.com/2010/11/flood-movies.html)
into the situation:

> You need to get to higher ground. From Deep Impact, we can see that you're
> supposed to leave your house and head for the mountains, but since everybody
> else is going to do the same thing and clog up the roads, you'd better get a
> bike, like Elijah Wood did. And in 2012, the gigantic ships were all built
> and launched in the Himalayas because that was the last place the flood
> waters would reach.

There have also been calls for the government to postpone the Malaysian
Certificate of Education (SPM) examinations, which is a national examination
taken by all secondary school students and is equal to the O-Level; which the
government has refused.
