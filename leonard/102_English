Bangladesh has large reserves of natural gas and some petroleum deposits which
is the center of attention of many international energy companies. A recent
[Production Sharing Contract
(PSC)](http://bangladeshwatchdog.blogspot.com/2011/06/gas-deal-with-american-
energy-giant.html) between the Bangladesh government and United States (US)
energy giant ConocoPhillips for deep sea gas exploration has sparked renewed
debate in the country.

Bangladesh, being a populous country with poor infrastructure, itself is an
energy starved country and some people are against the export of its natural
resources. Activists from the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral
Resources, Power and Ports (NCPOGMR) have been campaigning in the country to
raise public awareness on this issue.

One of the activists _Rahnuma Ahmed_
[writes](http://www.shahidulnews.com/2011/06/de-energising-bangladesh/):

> There is a growing national awareness of the issue of ownership of natural
> resources; of the terms on which production sharing contracts are signed

> multinational companies. More broadly, of whether the nation’s ruling class,

Government and US firm ConocoPhillips took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Image

On June 16, 2011, ConocoPhillips signed an agreement with Bangladesh
government for the oil and gas exploration from two deep-sea blocks in the Bay
of Bengal covering an area of 5,158 square kilometres. Two days before the
signing (on June 14, 2011) police brutally cracked down on the members of
NCPOGMR who were rallying against the deal highlighting corruption and the
fact that the share of Bangladesh government of the explorations will be 20%
only.

I saw the picture of Rehnuma Ahmed who was the teacher of Anthropology in the
Jahangirnagar University. Blood is flowing from her head flooding her face.
Why the government has done this? This was a peaceful protest and they are not
like the other violent political parties. It seems that the multinational
companies and the government want’s blood. What for? Oil and gas. That’s true,
blood is less valuable than coal, oil and gas.

She is not a political activist but merely wanted to express her opinions as a
citizen of an independent country. The issue is the controversial deal between
ConocoPhillips and the Bangladesh government. She thinks that the natural
resources of the country is handed out to a foreign firm without proper
consideration, hence the protest. When police crack down on this protest
brutally then you have to admit that there is no practice of true democracy in
the country. A democratic government of a civilized country cannot gag
people's voice like this.

There are also alternative opinions. _Sultan Mohammed Zakaria_ [terms these
protests](http://www.ebangladesh.com/2011/06/20/conocophillips-and-the-
bankruptcy-of-our-left-politics/) as the bankruptcy of the left politics in
Bangladesh. The blogger argues:

Blogger _Dinmozur_ in a [previous
post](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/dinmojurblog/29001630) highlighted
the terms of PSC especially that Bangladesh will have to buy at the market
rate and at the terms of the explorer company. As there is no limit of
exploration, the gas will be explored at maximum limit and Bangladesh will not
be able to buy beyond its need at a given time. So the reserve will be
exhausted soon and maximum gas will be exported making Bangladesh's future
uncertain.

A commenter at the [post of
Dinmojur](http://www.somewhereinblog.net/blog/dinmojurblog/29001630) [bn]
says:

> আমাদের দেশে এত গ্যাস সংকট থাকা সত্ত্বেও ৮০% গ্যাস রপ্তানি রাখার সুযোগ কে

We deplore that as per PSC despite the gas crisis in our country 80% of gas
reserve can be exported.

_Rahnuma_ [reveals](http://www.shahidulnews.com/2011/06/de-energising-

The attacks did not lessen the morals of the activists and fresh rounds of
protests have been called.
