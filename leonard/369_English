Since arriving in Bahrain on February 15, New York Times columnist [Nicholas
D. Kristof
](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nicholas_D._Kristof)has
joined the many voices on Twitter live-reporting turbulent events. While many
have been thankful for his updates, and even [worried for his
safety](https://twitter.com/#!/Ali_Aamer3178/status/38651494790205440) when
tweeting slowed, others have instead taken to
[bullying](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23NickKristof) the reporter.
The tweets mostly consist of accusing Kristof of lying in the most creative
terms.

constant updates, [@nickkristof ](https://twitter.com/#!/NickKristof)has been
tweeting his experiences over the past days, including the [re-telling of
stories of victims](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/17/bahrain-
nicholas-kristof-an-eyewitness/) who were attacked by the army and police.
Tensions are high, and state media often tell a different version of events.
Twitter users who express opinions that contradict either one side or another
are often taunted.

This is just a brief selection of some of the tweets appearing on the hashtag
[#nickkristof](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23NickKristof) on Friday
night:

There is much more, and worse. In the early morning hours the tweeting stopped
with several people signing off and thanking everyone for the barrels of
#nickkristof satire and humor.

> [@Noonieee](https://twitter.com/#!/Noonieee/status/38740254236217344): A
> petition has been put up to report #NickKristof ‘s bias to the New York
> Times Editor <http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/NickKristoff>

One Bahraini student in London, Hassan Al Bash, created an online petition
against Kristof explaining his frustration with the reporter. [The petition,
signed by 64 people so
far](http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/NickKristoff), says Kristof failed
to report all sides of the story, and allegedly posted unconfirmed information
about the Saudi military being in Bahrain.

> This issue was not about sectarian hate, the people did not want to
> overthrow the government. What the people were peacefully protesting for was
> reform, but Nick Kristof went on to compare the situation to Tunisia’s and
> Egypt’s. Not once did he mention the opposing point of view, not once did he
> see look at the situation objectively, and see that both sides were wrong.
