As the socio-political crisis in Pakistan is getting out of hand, emphasis on
education has been stressed by the civil society. This thought mainly is due
to the fact and hope that maybe, just maybe, education might be the key to
bringing stability amidst the unsettling internal civil war that Pakistanis
face on a daily basis.

An education news blog (from Florida, USA) tweeted this shocking yet not
surprising information:

In a profoundly written blog at the Express Tribune by Asad Ali, titled [“Riaz
wanted to learn English”](http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/6645/riaz-wanted-
to-learn-english/); the writer talks about a newspaper boy and his
determination to read and write English. He tried his level best to help this
boy and gave him his e-mail address to write back to him once he was able to
read and write English. Here is what Asad Ali had to say after 11 years:

> Almost eleven years later (three days ago) I received an e-mail from Riaz

> to be truly remarkable.

> Riaz’s story is a testament to the fact that our [youths are thirsty for

Unfortunately not all opinions are motivational and uplifting. Many blogs talk
about how the level of education in Pakistan is not only extremely challenging
but also very stagnant.

As [Dr. M. Pasha ](http://marpasha.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/to-whom-should-we-
ask-to-whom-should-we-balm/)states in his blog:

> I wish our politicians and bureaucracy can understand that educating young
> people in today’s globalized world is more complex and painstaking task than
> anything else. It involves caring for the development of students’
> intellect, emotional, social and physical growth. Simply hard work,
> dedication and commitment is not enough. This requires professionalism.
> Quality education can only be achieved through an uninterrupted execution of
> intelligently crafted educational processes by a group of well trained
> professionals equipped with appropriate knowledge, skills and attitude
> working in a technology enhanced teaching-learning environment furnished
> with appropriate provisions. A small number of rightly educated students are
> more valuable for a secure and prosperous Pakistan than a large army of non-
> productive, misguided, frustrated young graduates. Vice chancellor is always
> a leader of his/her university. He/she is responsible of managing quality.
> What could we expect from a university which does not have a vice
> chancellor? I wish people in Pakistan could grasp the meaning of the latest

Kalsoom Lakhani at [Changing Up
Pakistan](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/) highlights a new
initiative called ‘ **Teach for Pakistan** ‘, which is part of the Teach for
All global network (which includes Teach for America). Here is what she has to
say in an article titled [“Teach for Pakistan: Bringing Innovation to
Education”](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/teach-for-
pakistan-bringing-innovation-to-education/):

[![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

Without a doubt, Pakistan has a long way to go to better its literacy rate.
Keeping in mind that education and literacy are two completely different forms
of conformity, if they are not made to work together, “reading and writing
itself” can be a futile and a lost cause.
