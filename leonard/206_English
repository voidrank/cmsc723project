A slew of food scandals have occurred in China in recent weeks, highlighting
the country's ongoing challenge with maintaining levels of [food
safety](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/11/28/china-ditch-oil-floods-
restaurants/).

Most recently, a
[report](http://shanghaiist.com/2011/04/12/now_even_steamed_buns_arent_safe_en.php)
on broadcaster _CCTV2_ revealed that a Shanghai producer of steamed buns
(mantou) used dye and excessive amounts of artificial sweetener in the
product, and relabelled for sale buns that had already expired and been
returned from local supermarkets. Wang Longxing, director of the Shanghai Food
Safety Office, has since
[apologised](http://shanghaiist.com/2011/04/15/shanghai_food_safety_official_apolo.php)
for the scandal, insisting that supermarkets should also bear some
responsibility for failing to check the quality of the buns before selling
them.

**Poisonous milk, meat, rice, and then?**

Also this month, three children have died and 35 others have been hospitalised
in the northwestern province of Gansu, after drinking what officials suspect
was [milk tainted with nitrite](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2011/04/china-
tainted-milk-kills-three-children/), an industrial salt. Chinese state media
[followed up with
news](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/12/c_13825347.htm)
from police that two suspects had intentionally poisoned the milk out of anger
against the farmer who had produced it.

In March, [pork](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2011/03/chinas-largest-meat-
processor-apologizes-over-additive-scandal/) from a subsidiary of China’s
largest meat processor, Shuanghui Group in Henan, was found to contain an
illegal additive, clenbuterol, used to produce lean meat. Authorities in the
province responded by taking 72 people associated with producing, using or
selling the additive into custody, closing 16 pig farms and seizing 134 tonnes
of pork products. China's Ministry of Agriculture also
[pledged](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-03/28/c_13802146.htm)
that the government would launch a one-year crackdown on the use of illegal
additives in pig feed.

China's rice sector has also faced controversy, with various
[reports](http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4198)
highlighting that as much as 10% of the country's rice is tainted with heavy
metals. In southern China in particular, toxins have been discharged with
sewage by mining operations and made their way into rice paddies. A recent
[expose by _Caixin_
magazine](http://english.caing.com/2011-02-16/100226177.html) revealed:

> Much of the toxic rice is consumed by farm families who can't afford the
> “clean” rice sold in markets. But some rice laced with heavy metals also
> slips through safety checks and is sold on the general market, experts say,
> sometimes to consumers in China's wealthiest cities.

**Unsolved melamine milk scandal**

Such potentially fatal episodes are not new. Perhaps the most notable scandal
came in 2008, when six children died and nearly 300,000 fell ill from
[powdered milk laced with
melamine](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal). An
industrial chemical, when added to watered-down milk it can boost readings of
protein levels, but also causes kidney stones in infants. The episode prompted
Chinese authorities to tighten the regulation of food safety, with the
country's first Food Safety Law taking effect in June 2009. (Incidentally,
China's top legislator yesterday [called
for](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/16/c_13831795.htm) a
more in-depth and comprehensive enforcement of the legislation).

Responding to the scandal was [Zhao
Lianhai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Lianhai)
(@[zhaolianhai](http://twitter.com/zhaolianhai)), whose son fell ill from the
tainted milk. He set up a website for other affected parents to exchange
details on how to sue the companies involved, and was in 2010 sentenced to two
and a half years in prison for “disturbing social order” as a result of his
activism. He was released on medical parole in December of the same year.

In a recent [YouTube clip](http://cmp.hku.hk/2011/04/08/11394/) in which he
calls for the release of detained artist [Ai
Weiwei](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/04/china-ai-weiwei-detained-
initial-twitter-reactions/) and other victims of China's recent
[crackdown](http://www.economist.com/node/18560351) on potential dissent, Zhao
alludes to the 2008 scandal:

> It seems that many children have been unable to receive timely treatment,
> including some children whose cases have become more serious. Local
> governments, and relevant departments included, have simply turned their
> backs. We hope first of all from a humanitarian viewpoint, from the most
> basic consideration of our children, that some practical things be urgently
> done. I’m sure that all parents will have an attitude of tolerance in
> looking at the tragedies that befell each of our families. In this age of
> hours, we can withstand a measure of grievance. But we hope that all of the
> ills we bear can bring more goodness for this country of ours, creating a
> better social environment for those who come after us. In that society, all
> of our generations will live in security.

**Netizens’ comments**

[_ChinaGeeks_](http://chinageeks.org/) last week [selected and
translated](http://chinageeks.org/2011/04/netizens-on-food-safety) a handful
of netizens’ recent comments on [Sina Weibo](http://t.sina.com.cn/) [zh],
China's domestic version of [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). Among them:

> Take the people from the [relevant] government department out and shoot
> them. Why is it always the media that discovers this stuff first?

> Any food may have something added to it, so why aren’t the higher-level
> leaders nervous? They think that of course the common people must eat from
> the same special, environmentally protected stock that they do […] what
> high-level official has been investigated or forced to resign? The common
> people are forced to determine for themselves whether even basic foods and
> drinks are poisoned or not. Leaders of the food safety [department], have
> you no sense of shame? If those food inspection officials who shirked their
> duty aren’t executed, the problem of contaminated food will never disappear.

> There’s no big scandal here, don’t be alarmist. Isn’t this just inserting
> some dye for color? Isn’t it just putting expired mantou back to work? What
> is that, it’s no big deal… As a great Chinese citizen, as the descendants of
> Yan Di and Huang Di, as the Chinese who have successfully made it to this
> point, you’re not even willing to eat this, and you’re not ashamed?

> China itself is a society of mutual poisoning, a society of mutual pain-
> infliction. You add some [poison] to the milk, I put sweet additives into
> expired mantou, he puts additives into the food he feeds his pigs, oil,
> crab, rice, duck eggs… even if the milk manufacturers don’t drink milk, they
> eat mantou. Even if the mantou makers don’t eat mantou, they eat pork. Even
> if the pork farmers don’t eat pork, they drink milk. In the end, we’re just
> hurting ourselves. The nation is in peril, inviting ridicule and shame.

Blogger Jiangminct, meanwhile, responded to the discovery of mercury in Coilia
Ecetenes Jordan, a rare and expensive fresh water fish in the Yangtze river.
Fish dealers had [injected
mercury](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5fbd15020100qbql.html) [zh] to
increase the weight of the fish and make it look fresher.

> 今天我不打算评论有关部门和所有监督部门，这个话题让人很累，说了还是一样，再过几天某地又会冒出某食品有问题的新闻。至于为什么，只可意会，不可言传，你们都懂的。总之，相信谁也不如相信自己。在这个神奇的国家，我们的食品没有最毒，只有更毒。

Our people, flowers of our motherland, you are lucky to have dyed bun, heavy
metal rice, at least they would not take away your lives. See, after all these
years, you don't have cancer, no diarrhea. Your body is still in good shape.
This is proof. Don't you complain, you should be thankful to the dyed bun
manufacturers, they are so kind not to add mercury, just a little bid of
chemical dye. They are people with a very good conscience. […]

I don't want to comment on the role of food monitoring department, this is
such a tiring subject. There is no use commenting, news about food security
keeps popping up. Why? The reason cannot be spelled out, but I am sure you
know. In a nutshell, you cannot believe in anyone except yourself. In this
amazing country, we don't have the most poisonous food, but always the more
poisonous one.

Western and expat bloggers have largely remained
[unsurprised](http://www.chinalawblog.com/2011/04/china_food_safety_it_aint_working_and_we_told_you_so.html),
but [wonder](http://thechinaline.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/waiter-theres-a-
condom-in-my-soup/) for how long such scandals will continue before effective
government regulation is enforced.
