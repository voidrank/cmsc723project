The whale hunt seems to be the forgotten war in the public relations hype that
surrounds the collision of the Sea Shepherd’s Ady Gil with a Japanese whaler.

The bloggers’ focus in Australia has been the maritime clash and its reporting
by the media.

_Strange Times_ ’ youngmarxist was amongst the first to have issues,
questioning the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) reporting:

> The Australian [ABC has reported, as fact, allegations by the anti-whaling
> organisation Sea Shepherd that a Japanese whaling boat, the Shonan Maru 2,
> today deliberately sunk the Sea Shepherd vessel the Adi
> Gil](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/06/2786732.htm ).
>
> … It’s clear that the ABC has failed to report both sides of this story and
> is acting in this case as Sea Shepherd’s propaganda arm, rather than seeking
> out the statements presented in this post and giving people the information
> they need to start making their own conclusions.

_The Punch’s_ Tory Maguire is concerned about the risk to people’s lives by
this orchestrated stoush in the Southern Ocean:

> We’re not big on vigilantes in this nation, which has an imperfect but
> workable system of the rule of law, enforced by publicly funded police. Yet
> for some reason the ridiculous antics currently under way off the tip of
> Antarctica are allowed to carry on unchecked, and have prompted a frenzy of
> boys-own-adventure cheering here at home.

With perhaps just a touch of irony as a Murdoch staffer, she suggests a lack
of objectivity in the mainstream media coverage:

> Whomever is ultimately responsible for the sinking of the Ady Gil yesterday
> afternoon, it was highly irresponsible of the Sea Shepherd organisation to
> put the crew in such danger. But there was Mr Watson on the ABC this morning
> being hailed a hero for protecting the whales from the Japanese factory
> ships. He was also on Macquarie Radio, no doubt Fairfax radio, most TV
> stations and in every newspaper.

At _Ambit Gambit_ , Graham Young is even more pointed in his criticism of the
media . Firstly he disputes the accuracy of reports that the Ady Gil was
“stationary”:

> Sea Shepherds claim that the Adi Gil was in reverse when hit. It may have
> been, but this was after it put itself in front of the Shonan Maru.
>
> That journalists represent this as the Japanese ramming the Sea Sheperds is
> a result of clever manipulation by the Sea Shepherds.

Graham also attacks what he sees as similar bias:

> Fairfax newspapers ran a story saying that the Japanese had hired planes in
> Australia to track the Sea Shepherds. Instead of asking why the Sea
> Shepherds were allowed to use Australian ports to carry out acts of piracy
> in the Antarctic without hindrance (or surveillance) from the Australian
> government, the news stories, and the government response, condemned the
> Japanese.

Meanwhile political debate in Australia centres on what the Rudd government
should do about the continuing presence of whalers in Australian waters:

> AUSTRALIA should send the Oceanic Viking to monitor clashes between whalers
> and the anti-whaling Sea Shepherd vessels, which were operating “at the very
> limit and edge of the law”.
>
> An international law expert at the Australian National University, Professor
> Donald Rothwell, told The Australian Online that despite claims whalers had
> rammed the Ady Gill, it was clear “provocative” behaviour was involved on
> the part of the anti-whaling protesters.

The same article in _The Australian_ newspaper has an online poll ‘WHALING
SHOWDOWN': Who do you think is to blame for the collision between a Japanese
whaling ship and Sea Shepherd protest boat?

Whalers and Protesters are the only choices.
