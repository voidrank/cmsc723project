On May 19, the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama and Ms.
Margarita Zavala, wife of Mexican President, Felipe Calderón, visited an
elementary school in Silver Spring, Maryland. At one point in the visit, a
7-year-old second-grader named Daisy, who is of Peruvian descent asked Ms.
Obama a question that was captured [on video by the news
media](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sn8rTr8zcw&feature=player_embedded). As
[detailed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/05/19/AR2010051903314.html) by the Washington Post,
the girl wanted to know why the president was “taking everybody away that
doesn't have papers”. And Ms. Obama, with the first lady of Mexico by her
side, told the girl: “That's something that we have to work on, right? To make
sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers”. And then the girl
replied that her “mom doesn't have any papers”.

The girl has prompted Peruvian bloggers to talk about her and about some
immigration issues facing their community in the United States.

The blog _Holismo Planetario en la Web_ [es] calls Daisy [“The face of
immigration in the United
States”](http://holismoplanetario.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/el-rostro-de-la-
inmigracion-en-los-estados-unidos-daisy-cuevas/):

> […], la niña de 7 años que le preguntó a la primera dama de Estados Unidos,
> Michelle Obama, qué se podía hacer para evitar el temor de su mamá a ser
> deportada al Perú por ser indocumentada, es considerada la “vocera” de más
> de 12 millones de inmigrantes que viven de manera ilegal en el país. Su
> inocente comportamiento ha despertado un interés inusitado en la prensa
> estadounidense por el espinoso tema.

The 7 year-old the girl, who asked U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama what could
be done in order to avoid the fear her mom had of being deported back to Peru
as an undocumented immigrant, is considered the “spokesperson” for the more
than 12 million immigrants that live illegally in the country. Her innocent
behavior has aroused an unusual interest in the U.S. press regarding this
thorny subject.

The blog [_Libretita de Notas_
[es]](http://libretitadenotas.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/daisy-la-nina-que-puso-
en-aprietos-a-michelle-obama/) has another perspective of the development:

> Para algunos es una heroína, para otros la hija de una pareja de peruanos
> que ingresaron ilegalmente a Estados Unidos y que, sin permisos de
> extranjería suficientes, deberán ser deportados cuanto antes. Lo cierto es
> que la pequeña Daisy Cuevas también ha puesto en debate una regla de oro del
> periodismo: aquella que señala que la identidad de los menores de edad no
> puede revelarse, ni siquiera cuando estos se convierten en protagonistas de
> la noticia.
>
> […]
>
> ¿Sin embargo, qué pasa cuándo la protagonista pone en aprietos a la esposa
> del presidente de Estados Unidos al preguntarle si es cierto que su esposo
> no quiere aprobar la reforma migratoria que permitiría a sus padres quedarse
> en Norteamérica y no ser deportación por indocumentados?

To some people, she is a heroine, to others, the daughter of a Peruvian couple
that entered the United States illegally, and without residence permits, must
be deported as soon as possible. The thing is little Daisy Cuevas has also
opened up the debate about a golden rule in journalism: the one that says that
the identity of minors cannot disclosed, not even when they become the
spotlight of the news.

[…]

However, what happens when the main figure puts the wife of the President of
the United States in a tight corner by asking her if it is true that her
husband does not want to approve the immigration reform that would allow her
parents to stay in the US and not being deported for [being] undocumented?

comments](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/05/immigration-hits-
home-for-young-girl-and-first-lady-michelle-obama.html#comments) against the
situation of Daisy's parents:

According to [DePeru.com
[es]](http://www.deperu.com/abc/articulo.php?con=265), about 3 million
Peruvian citizens live abroad: 52% of them in the United States, 27% in other
countries of South America, 13% in Europe and 8% in Asia. The same site states
that most of the Peruvian citizens living in the United States are there
illegally working in manual labor jobs.

As [Herberth Castro Infantas
[es]](http://herberthcastroinfantas.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/nina-peruana-
conmueve-al-mundo/) concludes his most recent post in his blog:

> Todos esparamos que este clamor no sirva de pretexto para tomar represalias
> con su familia ni con los millones de indocumentados.

We all hope this clamor won't be used as an excuse in retaliation against her
family nor the millions of undocumented immigrants.
