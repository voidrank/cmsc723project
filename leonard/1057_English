Since January’s World Social Forum in Belém, where alternative media were
heralded for bringing progressive and pluralistic information to the fore,
online independent initiatives have been flourishing in Brazil. Alongside
well-established community media, the [Independent Media
Center](http://www.midiaindependente.org/) has collectives based throughout
major Brazilian cities, Web 2.0 hosts countless blogs, [alternative news
websites](http://www.revistaforum.com.br/sitefinal/parceiros.asp.) [pt],
forums and interfaces, and [cyberactivism](http://www.trezentos.blog.br/) [pt]
is quickly taking shape.

These examples are fortifying themselves through city- and state-level
meetings with civil society organisations and academics in preparation for
Brazil’s first National Conference of Communication in December. Entitled
‘Communications: a Means for Building Rights and Citizenship in the Digital
Era’, it signals a very first step in democratising Brazil’s communications
system.

But in spite of alternative sectors showing democratic trends, Brazilian media
are famously epitomised by high
[concentration](http://www.opendemocracy.net/media-
globalmediaownership/article_64.jsp) within the hands of under ten families.
Unsurprisingly, then, the players in the fight for media democratisation have
numerous proposals, including strengthening Brazil’s public service
broadcasting, fine-tuning the elusive regulatory framework, expanding former
Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil’s programme of digital inclusion and
investing more in alternative and community sectors.

The blogosphere remains divided into which proposal is the most important.
Several feminist blogs, for instance, remind us that regulation, monitoring
and reviewing the press law are all fundamental. These may also fall under the
umbrella of social control, which, for blogger [_Alessandra
Terribili_](http://terribili.blogspot.com/2009/05/tal-de-lei-de-imprensa-por-
uma.html),

> É garantir que eles não podem dizer o que querem, reforçar esteriótipos,
> legitimar preconceitos, seduzir pelo consumo, informar pela metade, esconder
> uma parte… não podem fazer isso impunemente.

“Is to ensure that they [private businesses funding media organisations] can
not say what they want to reinforce stereotypes, prejudices legitimate,
seduced by consumer report by half, hiding a part … we cannot do this with
impunity.”

But for cyber-activist site
[_Trezentos_](http://www.trezentos.blog.br/?p=3025) [pt], digital inclusion
remains paramount. Their proposals go beyond expanding broadband and
connectivity infrastructure across Brazil to also stressing the _digital_
rights of citizens:

> “Todos os brasileiros têm o direito ao acesso à Internet sem distinção de
> renda, classe, credo, raça, cor, opção sexual, sem discriminação física ou
> cultural […] Todo cidadão tem direito de acessar informações públicas em
> sites da Internet sem discriminação de sistema operacional, navegador ou
> plataforma computacional utilizada. Toda pessoa tem o direito a escrever em
> blogs e participar de redes sociais com seu nome, com codinome ou
> anonimamente.”

“Brazilians have the right to access the Internet regardless of income, class,
creed, race, color, sexual orientation, no physical or cultural discrimination
[…] Every citizen has the right to access public information on Internet sites
without regard to operating system, browser or computer platform used.
Everyone has the right to write on blogs and social networking with your name,
code name or anonymously.”

How far these proposals will come into effect, given 2010’s presidential
election, is debatable. Further, communication is not widely recognised a
human right, and alternative vehicles are seldom collectively mobilised.
Brazil’s gradual digital inclusion of 34% of the country having Internet
access, with only 5% benefiting from broadband, also stands in stark contrast
to the 98% of the population watching television. However counter-hegemonic
the fight to democratise communication is, it is ultimately overshadowed by
the monopolistic mainstream.

Whilst the conference may see more public involvement in policy-making and a
more joint, active role played by alternative media players and [civil
society](http://www.intervozes.org.br) actors, both Brazilian media and
democracy are fragile and ongoing. But it is of the essence that they
strengthen together: for blogger [_Pablo Pedroso
[pt]_](http://pablojus.blogspot.com/2009/10/midia-brasileira-esta-cega-e-
servico.html)

> “Parte do esforço para a profunda transformação socioeconômica do Brasil,
> passa pela democratização dos meios de comunicação.”

“Part of the effort for the deep socio-economic transformation of Brazil is
the democratisation of the media.”

Therefore, the Conference is just the first step in the long ‘ant-work’ Brazil
faces in its democratic development. We will simply have to wait and see how
much converging technologies result in converging interests.
