Hundreds of thousands of people flooded to Tahrir, the Liberation Square in
Cairo. This is the largest demonstration in a week of unceasing demands for
President Hosni Mubarak to leave after nearly 30 years in power, Egypt. Photo

The news of the recent protests in Egypt is being discussed in the South Asian
blogosphere in different perspectives. The bloggers are keen on the
developments of the uprising. Sri Lankan blogger _Indrajit Samarajiva_ [shares
this eagerness](http://indi.ca/2011/02/the-egyptian-test-match/):

> I’ve been watching the Egyptian Revolution like it’s a cricket match,
> checking the score throughout the day. Right now it’s the people 1 million,
> Mubarak one.

Pakistani blog _PK Politics_ [draws parallel with the protests against former
Pakistani dictators](http://pkpolitics.com/2011/02/01/egyptians-rise/):

> Tunisian wave has sparked Egyptians to rise against a dictator that was
> holding absolute power for decades. The dictator Hosni Mubarak is repeating
> same sequence of mistakes that Pakistani military dictator performed in his
> last few years and refusing to accept the voice of nation.

Nepali blogger _Paramendra Bhagat_ asks [how many people could Mubarak
kill](http://technbiz.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-many-people-could-mubarak-
kill.html):

> The point is it is a finite number. There are only so many people Mubarak
> could kill. We did this in Nepal in 2006. The king of Nepal issued a shoot
> at sight order, and the people braved the bullets. About two dozen people
> were shot down before the regime collapsed.
>
> There are only so many people Mubarak can kill. The brave people of Egypt
> have to not stop. This can be done. Democracy is not an American export.
> Liberty is an export of the human heart. It comes from inside. This is
> nothing to do with America.
>
> You don't need no internet. You don't need no mobile phones. You don't need
> Twitter. All you need is air. You pack the energy into the air. All you have
> to do is be able to feel the ring of freedom. This is not about technology.
> This is about that which rings from every human heart. It comes from within.

Indian blogger _SM_ [hopes that Indians will take courage from the Egyptian
protests to fight against
corruption](http://realityviews.blogspot.com/2011/01/citizens-of-egypt-revolt-
against-egypt.html):

> The revolution and protest may not succeed today, but people will realize
> the power of Twitter and Face book and the power of unity when Innocent
> citizens join hands and come on Road.
>
> Today our Indian Situation is also not good corruption is increasing day by
> day, I hope government will stop the corruption before the people come on
> road to protest against corruption.

_Afzal Rahim Khan Yusufzai_
[wonders](http://yusufzai.blogspot.com/2011/02/revolution-in-pakistan.html)
whether Pakistan is ripe for a revolution similar to what Egypt is
experiencing:

> Most Pakistanis would love to be that nation, hoping that Tunisia’s
> revolutionary ripples, already rocking Egypt and nudging Yemen, will reach
> Pakistan too. Enduring raging inflation, malignant corruption, dilapidated
> public services, an ultra-incompetent, dishonest government and an extra-
> insincere opposition, ineffectual judicial remedies, brutal feudal lords and
> tribal chiefs, lynch mobs, daily drone and terrorist attacks, assemblies of
> cheats, tax evaders and fake degree holders, surely Pakistan is ripe for
> revolution? Sadly not!

The blogger states why Pakistan will not join the revolution bandwagon:

> The ingredients for revolution are simply not in place. Pakistan has sharp
> religious divide, low levels of literacy and a general feeling of apathy and
> defeatism in the population and additional factors which militate against a
> revolution: deep and multiple ethnic, linguistic, tribal and sectarian fault
> lines; a paucity of alternative intellectual narratives, radical leaders or
> strong unions; and an elected government and freedom of speech. Past
> experience suggests that it is likely that the events in Arab countries will
> leave Pakistan unchanged. Protests only become spontaneous after a certain
> critical mass is reached. Before that, they are contrived.

_Nitin Pai_ at _The acorn_
[suggests](http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2011/02/01/regarding-egypts-
political-transformation/) how the Indian government should react to the
situation:

> New Delhi would do well to avoid taking sides in this conflict—leaving it to
> the likes of the United States and Europe to pay up for dishes they ordered.
> At the same time, the Indian government must signal that it will do business
> with whoever remains or comes to power.

Bangladeshi blogger _Sirat_ at _Sachalayatan_ blog
[analyzes](http://www.sachalayatan.com/sirat/37413) what the post-revolution
phase of Egypt promises:

> পশ্চিমা রক্ষণশীল পর্যবেক্ষকরা মিশরীয় সমাজে ইসলামের পেনেট্রিশন নিয়ে বেশ ভীত।
> আগে হোক, পরে হোক, তাদের মতে ইসলামপন্থী একটি সরকার আসবেই।
>
> কিভাবে?
>
> হয় সেনাবাহিনীর পতনের মধ্য দিয়ে, যেটা যে কোন মুহূর্তেই হতে পারে হঠাৎ এক
> রক্তস্নাত বিকেলে। তখন আর মুসলিম ব্রাদারহুডকে থামায় কে?
>
> বা সেনাবাহিনীতেই ক্যু এর মধ্য দিয়ে। বা নির্বাচনের মধ্য দিয়ে – মুসলিম
> ব্রাদারহুড মিশরের সবচেয়ে জনপ্রিয় দল, মুবারকের সরকারি দল ছাড়া। তখন
> আমেরিকা-ইসরায়েল-মিশর ভারসাম্যের কি হবে?

The Western conservative spectators are afraid of the penetration of Islam in
Egyptian societies. Today or tomorrow an Islamic government will come to
power.
