Pastor Rony Tan of Lighthouse Evangelism, an independent church in Singapore
with 12,000 members, has already apologized for attacking Buddhism and Taoism
in his sermons. Pastor Tan apologized after receiving a call from the
[Internal Security
Department](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1036211/1/.html).
Despite the apology, the issue remains a controversial topic in the
blogosphere.

Part 1 of the [infamous video
sermon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIrtk5V_t-Q) of Pastor Tan

An excerpt from Pastor Tan’s statement of
[apology](http://www.lighthouse.org.sg/)

> I have received a number of emails from people who have been saddened and
> hurt by the testimonies of an ex-monk and an ex-nun. I realized that my
> presentation and comments were wrong and offensive. So I sincerely apologize
> for my insensitivity towards the Buddhists and Taoists, and solemnly promise
> that it will never happen again.
>
> When we have received those emails, we immediately removed the video clips
> from our website. I urge those who have posted those clips on the YouTube to
> remove them as well.

Like many Singaporeans, Choo Zheng X was
[angry](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/02/take-a-stand-for-moderation-
liberty-and-genuine-understanding/) after viewing the videos

> I felt deeply angry when I saw the videos of Pastor Rony Tan deriding
> Buddhists in his church. A place of worship was used to propagate
> misinformation and ignorance. A faith of love and acceptance was being used
> as a vehicle of intolerance.
>
> Other Singaporeans were angry too, so angry that a large number were calling
> for Pastor Tan to be jailed under the Internal Security Act or the Sedition
> Act. But I held myself back

But the author is hesitant about using the Sedition Act to punish the pastor

> It’s telling that when controversy like this occurs, Singaporeans
> immediately look to a punitive measure to solve the problem. That’s how
> simplistic our attitudes towards faith and ethnicity have become.
>
> Sadly, laws like the Sedition Act encourage Singaporeans to take the path of
> least resistance, short circuit important social dialogue, and retard the
> process of seeking richer inter-faith/cultural confidence building.

Alvin Phoon warns against using exaggerated legal and punitive actions
[against the pastor](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/02/it-has-only-just-
begun/)

> Bigots of different religions and persuasions squabble all the time.
> Normally I’m happy to sit back and watch because they make for good
> entertainment. However, in this case, threatening legal action against one
> party for making religiously insensitive comments is rash and will bear
> serious future consequences. Instead of being so adamant on imprisoning a
> man for mere words that were probably not even well thought out in the first
> place, why can’t we just take a step back, and move on with our lives? Pile
> on the humiliation if you must. But remember that the day Rony Tan goes to
> prison is the day religious tolerance and freedom of opinion ceases to
> exist.

Shawn Lim wants the pastor to be
[punished](http://tauhuayboy.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/punish-pastor-tan/)

> What they should have done, instead of warning him, was to punish him. Fine
> him; send him to jail, whatever. If it takes a show of power to prevent this
> kind of incidence from happening again, by all means, do whatever that is
> necessary.
>
> So why are the authorities so lenient when what Pastor Rony was clearly out
> of line with the first rule of religious harmony; which is to show respect
> for other religions? Do they not realise that a ‘warning’ in an increasingly
> vocal society is not enough?

_dhamma musings_ does not believe that the current practice of holding [inter-
religious dialogues](http://sdhammika.blogspot.com/2010/02/pastor-tan-
fallout.html) in Singapore can promote religious and racial harmony

> I doubt that inter-religious dialogue, at least as it is conducted in
> Singapore, really brings about a change in how the different religions feel
> about each other. The participants are already respectful of other faiths.
> The ones who could do with a bit of tolerance – the bigots, zealots,
> fundamentalists and the evangelicals, won’t come

_i.justrealized_ notes that religion is a [sensitive
issue](http://i.justrealized.com/2010/02/11/christian-pastor-rony-tan-
badmouths-buddhism-regrets/) in Singapore

> Actually the interviewees are quite funny if you watch it with an open mind.
> One of the interviewees revealed that he had some bowel problems causing
> blood during defecation. In a moment of fear, he prayed to Jesus and was
> totally healed.
>
> I should point out that religion is a sensitive issue, especially in
> Singapore, where the risks of tensions are high. We will not want to
> jeopardize peace in the process. Singapore has been strict on religious
> harmony.
>
> In the church I frequented, there is a strong belief that Christianity is
> the only true religion and all other religions are Satan attempting to bring
> away people from the Christian God.
