making and promoting a music video can get tough. The 99 Dollar Music Video
website gives bands and filmmakers a chance to shine with creative videos,
shot in one day, edited in one day and costing no more than 99 US Dollars.

As [they explain](http://www.99dollarmusicvideos.com/page/about):

> $99 Music Videos is an independent music network dedicated to merging low-
> fi, cutting-edge videos with the best of today's music scene. Every week, we
> feature a debut music video from independent bands who've teamed up with
> local filmmakers to making a new, original music videos.

While most of the videos come from continental USA, there have been
submissions from other countries, and today we bring you one of those
examples. From Brazil, musician
[qinhO](http://www.99dollarmusicvideos.com/musicvideos/episode/99MV_20090903/qinho-
mais-de-uma-janela) and [drgameiro ](http://drgameiro.com/)rose up to the
challenge, but he only spent 17 dollars on his “Mais de uma Janela” video:

In the following[ Skype

with the channel, which is part of the [Next New
Networks](http://www.nextnewnetworks.com/).

Videos are submitted by the artists or filmmakers, and if you have a video
that fits their criteria, it can be added to the channel. Although [the
channel's](http://www.99dollarmusicvideos.com/) production has slowed down
lately, we hope they surprise us with a new season.
