bad joke, today's [World Toilet Day](http://www.worldtoiletday.com/) focuses
on a not-so-funny issue impacting almost half the world's population — a lack
of toilets and sanitation.

People may be too embarrassed to openly talk about it, but everyone does it,
toilet or not. World Toilet Day helps people celebrate the importance of
sanitation and raise awareness for the 2.5 billion people who don't have
access to toilets and proper sanitation. This video by the nonprofit WaterAid
[highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T2eH7zrDJg) the luxury of having
a toilet.

Celebrating your can may seem silly, but not having one can not only lead to
embarrassment, lack of dignity and safety issues, but also preventable
diseases and even death. When people don't have toilets, they're forced to
relieve themselves in open streets, fields, or back alleys. The result? The
contamination of drinking water and food sources, which leads to a slew of
health risks. Lack of sanitation is the world’s biggest cause of infection and
kills [1.8 million people](http://worldtoiletday.com/about.html), mostly
children, a year. Even countries with abundant toilets have to deal with
problems ranging from unhygienic public toilets to waterway-destroying sewage
disposal.

Vanilla, blogging on _Let's Look At It This Way_ from Singapore, [says](
http://whatsayyouvanilla.blogspot.com/2009/11/world-toilet-day.html) that
people should care about toilets:

> “I know this is a crappy topic to most people. It is unfortunate that it is
> a ‘taboo’ topic to talk about openly and many people remain ignorant about
> the scale of the problem. I fail to understand how this can be an
> unimportant topic when, on an average, we visit the toilet 2500 times a
> year, or 6-8 times a day. In our life time, we would have spent 3 years in
> the toilet.”

Organized by the nonprofit [The World Toilet
Organization](http://worldtoiletday.com/wto.html), World Toilet Day is being
celebrated globally with various events. To further increase awareness,
WaterAid [announced]( http://wateraidnews.blogspot.com/2009/11/launch-of-new-
iphone-application-brings.html) the launch of its new ToiletFinder UK App for
iPhone users this week. The free app helps Brits find the nearest public
toilet while reminding them how lucky they are to have clean and safe toilets.
The largest event today, called [The Big
Squat](http://worldtoiletday.com/squat/), asks people to stop and squat for
one minute in a public place to raise awareness. These [photos](

including [this

of preschoolers in Singapore:

A blog from Brunei, _the world according to panyaluru …_ , also [shows
appreciation](http://panyaluru.blogspot.com/2009/11/cut-paste-toilets.html)
for the toilet by putting it into perspective:

> “Imagine if we are walking along in the row of shops in Kiulap or Gadong.
> Suddenly the tummy grumbles, just like the worst ribut you can think off. No
> rest bite. Grumble and grumble. Rumblings. The light is on amber and ready
> to turn green. But no toilets in sight. Not a single public toilet in the
> rows of shops…Add to that no water, no tissue, nothing! That could be the
> worst day of your life, your worst nightmare, ever worse than the nightmares
> those kids have in the Nightmare on Elm Street Movies. On this day, let’s
> show our appreciation to our toilets.”

Despite its serious side, many people have used humor to celebrate World
Toilet Day. In the U.K., the blog _London City Drains_ [features](
http://www.londonblockeddrain.co.uk/blog/index.php/2009/07/london-toilet-
drain-cleaning) a 10-question toilet quiz, while in this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx2oVPjnUXs) high school teacher Matt
Cheplic sings about the day.

Some bloggers point out that toilets alone may not be the answer. Sandhya,
blogging on _Maradhi Manni_ in India, [says](
http://maradhimanni.blogspot.com/2009/11/big-squat-to-take-stand-on-
sanitation.html ) many men don't use available toilets:

> “In a city like Chennai, where the climate is hot nearly 10 months of the
> year, I see men urinating on the roadside all the time. When women can
> control and go home and relieve themselves, why can't men do so, I don't
> know. So, first of all people should be fined heavily for doing this crime
> (yes, it is crime) on the spot. I have seen them doing this on the wall of
> the public toilets! In Srirangam, I saw them urinating on the compound wall
> of the temple even though every street surrounding the temple had toilets,
> which were clean, but pay toilets!”

While lack of sanitation impacts everyone, the taboo around toilets can
disproportionately affect women. In [some
countries](http://worldtoiletday.com/squat), modesty forces women do their
business in fields before sunrise or to hold it until after the sun sets,
leading to health and safety concerns. Joanne Sprague, blogging on
_Overturning Boulders_ in India, [observes](
http://overturningboulders.blogspot.com/2009/11/but-where-do-women-do-their-
business.html) that women are absent from the morning toilet run in Chennai,
while in Ethiopia the blog _AN ADVENTURE IN ADDIS_ [notices](
http://anadventureinaddis.com/2009/11/17/world-toilet-day/ ) a similar
situation:

> “I’ve heard so often about the lack of toilet facilities for women or lack
> of toilets in general; that teenage girls in the countryside get up at 4 am
> to go out in the dark to do their business so they don’t get bullied by the
> boys at school or stop going to school altogether. Men just pee anywhere,
> cigarette in hand and there’s an assumption that women don’t need to, if
> they are thought about at all….I want to see a huge billboard in Amharic
> saying ‘Girls go too’ with a picture of Barbie sitting on a toilet.”

To celebrate World Toilet Day, blogger Jonathan Stray, takes readers on an
[international tour of toilets](http://jonathanstray.com/world-toilet-day)
he's visited, from Thailand and the U.K. to West Africa and Oman, concluding:

> “We in the west with our flush toilets and toilet paper and sparkling shower
> stalls are the exception; the rest of the world thinks a bathroom is a wet,
> smelly place, when they have a bathroom at all. A good toilet means you
> probably have a very good quality of life, so enjoy yours. Happy World
> Toilet Day!”
