A boat carrying up to 100 Iranian, Iraqi and Kurdish asylum seekers crashed
into sharp cliffs off Christmas Island in Australia on December 15 killing at
least 30 people. Dozens of locals [witnessed the
shipwreck](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/12/19/3096885.htm) and
tried to help drowning men, women, and children as they struggled against
rough waves.

Opposition leader Tony Abbott had the campaign slogan 'Stop the boats' in the
August 2010 election (via Political Tarot)

The tragedy throws back into light the[ hard-line policies of Australia's
government](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/12/20/rintoul.island.tragedy/)
towards asylum seekers in the past years, which according to critics teeters
on xenophobic. The most controversial initiative is the mandatory holding of
refugees arriving by boat in offshore detention centers.

Refugees were a major issue in the August federal election won by center-left
Labor Party. A day before the boat crash, [U.S. embassy
cables](http://www.smh.com.au/national/us-critical-of-rudds-handling-of-
asylum-seekers-20101215-18y7c.html) released by WikiLeaks revealed that the
U.S. was critical of Australia's politics regarding asylum seekers, finding
the debate disproportionate to the numbers of migrants actually arriving this
way.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard's refugee policy has come under harsh attack from
both the right and left, with intense debate taking hold of the media and
blogosphere.

Right-wing _News Limited_ commentator Andrew Bolt was quick to respond to the
tragedy, [calling](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/gillard-
goverment-has-blood-on-its-hands-says-andrew-
bolt/story-e6frf7l6-1225971793016) for Gillard's resignation and accusing her
of having “blood on her hands” for not continuing as a harsh a policy against
asylum seekers as her predecessor (it was later followed up with [another
column arguing the same](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad-application/andrew-
bolt-why-i-wont-resign/story-fn6bn88w-1225973552736)). Bolt's strong remarks
sparked a passionate debate in other blogs and in the

Several bloggers also discussed Bolt's piece. On _[Club
Troppo](http://clubtroppo.com.au/2010/12/15/what-dreadful-news/)_ :

_slams Bolt's article as “repulsive and ghoulish”, saying:

_Pure Poison_ then updates the post with a link to a “spectacular comeback” to
Bolt by Jack Marx in a blog on the Daily Telegraph. He [quotes from the
piece](http://blogs.news.com.au/jackmarxlive/index.php/news/comments/showboat/):

_[Café Whispers](http://cafewhispers.wordpress.com/)_ lashes out at the right-
wing for attempting to make political gains out of a human tragedy, while
offering potential solutions to prevent the disaster from recurring:

> Please cast your political loyalties aside. It is evident that Labor or the
> Coalition cannot come up with a workable policy that will stop boat people
> from coming to Australia. I have no issue with people wanting to flee to our
> country, but I do have issues with these people being used as political
> tools and I certainly don’t want to see these people die in their endeavours
> to reach our shores. I am particularly sickened by the extreme right wing
> media who have tried to gain political mileage for their chosen ones out of
> the recent deaths on Christmas Island. In my opinion it demonstrates the the
> worst of the Australian character.

_Café Whispers_ then proposes alternative solutions including processing
refugees in Indonesia and imposing harsher penalties on the human traffickers.

Asylum seekers continue to evoke the rawest emotions out of Australians. It
strikes at the core of Australian society, and the contended self-perceptions
of Australia as an either racist or humanitarian nation. As the US critiqued
via its leaked cables, asylum seekers have been politicised for domestic
gains, with neither side willing to, “calmly and rationally put the issue in
perspective”.
