If you thought that the recent oil spills in USA,
[Australia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/06/australia-oil-spill-on-
iconic-waters-a-warning-to-obama/),
[Singapore](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/29/oil-spill-disaster-in-
singapore/) or
[elsewhere](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/06/26/worldwide-the-oil-
spills-that-dont-make-the-news/) were enough shock for the environment and the
human beings then please be prepared for more trauma as India is suffering
from another damaging oil spill.

_Srinivasan Sampathkumar_ from Triplicane, Chennai
[informs](http://sampspeak.blogspot.com/2010/08/collision-near-mumbai-coast-
msc-chitra.html) about the [latest oil
spill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Mumbai_oil_spill) near Mumbai Nhava
Sheva port:

> On 7th Aug 10, the container carrier MSC Chitra collided with MV Khalijia-

The impact is already being felt at the coasts of Mumbai, with fishes and
water creatures being found covered with oil. NDTV
[reports](http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/mumbai-oil-spill-impact-on-the-
environment-43528) that the oil slick has entered the sensitive mangrove belt
and it can damage the flora and fauna there. The shores filled with green
mangroves are already coated with black oil.

_Neeta Jadhav_ has been collecting water samples from different locations of
South Mumbai to detect pollution and [she
finds](http://neetajadhav.blogspot.com/2010/08/see-and-just-sympathize.html):

> The beautiful coastline is already under high anthropogenic pressure and
> now, MSC Chitra and Khalijia have just added to the cause. The mixture of
> oil and water is known as ‘mousse’, an extremely sticky substance that
> clings to any marine body and surface that comes in contact with it.
> Unfortunately, many marine life forms get trapped in it, while some may swim
> into it because it resembles food. Wildlife other than fish and sea
> creatures, including mammals, reptiles, and birds that live in or near the
> ocean, are also poisoned by the oil waste.
>
> About 500 tones of oil has already flown. Other than tones of fuel, diesel
> and lubricant oil, 31 containers have pesticide in them. We were worrying
> about the oil spill and now, containers of pesticide are bobbing off on the
> sea.

_Debolina Raja Gupta_ used to go to the Uran beach for its beauty and clean
water. But after the oil spill [she finds](http://debolina-raja-
gupta.blogspot.com/2010/08/as-we-push-mother-earth-to-her-end.html):

> The Uran beach that was once blessed with clean and pristine water is now a
> mess – a garbage dump to be precise. As the containers continue to spill

> things – locals have not spared a minute to snatch the loot. And now, the
> same people who hauled all the loot are complaining of various problems,
> caused by the various chemicals.[..]

> As the spill will continue to make its way in, environmentalists have said
> the entire mangroves will be charred and finished – I don’t want to see that

The Indian government has taken necessary steps but there is lot to be done.
The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI) has [offered to clean
up](http://20twentytwo.blogspot.com/2010/08/teri-offers-help-to-clear-mumbai-
coast.html) the mess left by oil spill with its patented homemade cocktail of
bacteria called ‘Oil Zapper.’ The process, which uses bacteria to clean up the
oil slick, could be used to neutralize the effect of the spill.

_Debajyoti Dutta-Roy_
[proposes](http://globalstudy.blogspot.com/2010/08/solving-mumbai-oil-
spill.html) some solutions to mitigate the disaster which includes:

> From Times of India report, it may take 6 to 8 months to remove the ship
> from the shallow bed on which it is lying. Solution: An Underwater ROV can
> be placed to keep a watch on what is happening in and around the ship.[..]
>
> How to solve the oil slick. Solution: Any oil slick will be maximum in the
> middle. So, the best thing would be to focus on the middle of the oil slick,
> which has the most concentration.

It may take months to contain the oil spill clean up the mess. But the worst
part of the disaster is that these toxic substances can easily enter the human
system and they will be passed on to the future generations. Will there ever
be additional safety measures deployed in the shipping industry to prevent
further oil spills?
