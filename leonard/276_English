A [6.8
earthquake](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/c0002aes/)
hit northeast Myanmar on the evening of Thursday 24 March, 2011, which was
felt in nearby Thailand and as far away as Vietnam and China. The
[quake](http://www.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=21008) killed at least
70 people and destroyed more than [240
buildings](http://www.dvb.no/news/quake-toll-hits-75-images-emerge/14950) in
Myanmar alone. Strong tremors were also recorded in the cities of Chiang Mai
and Chiang Rai in Thailand.

The number of casualties could be higher. According to reports, more than [80
coffins](http://democracyforburma.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/quake-death-toll-
could-reach-100-and-more-at-talerh-monglane-area/) were sold out in Tachilek
on the morning of Friday 25 March. Observers described the earthquake as the
third biggest natural disaster that struck Burma after the 2008 Cyclone
[Nargis](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/05/11/myanmar-survivors-of-
cyclone-nargis/) and the 2010 Cyclone
[Giri](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/22/cyclone-giri-hits-myanmar/).
