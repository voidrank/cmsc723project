A report of a remote-controlled, solar-powered hovering shade, which could be
used to cool soccer stadiums in Qatar, has taken on a life of its own, putting
the small but wealthy Gulf nation in the spotlight once again.

Almost a week ago, [_The
Peninsula_](http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/146510-qu-designs-cloud-to-
cool-your-corner-of-the-earth.html) newspaper wrote a brief, three paragraph
article describing research at Qatar University for an “artificial cloud”,
attributing the story to an Arabic newspaper.

Two days later, the story made it onto the [_BBC Sports_
page](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9435035.stm), this time
including an animation of the robotic “cloud” from Qatar University.

And then the next day, it was on _CNN_ :

And by now, it's had a run in
[_Time_](http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/27/robotic-clouds-will-provide-
shade-during-qatar-world-cup/), [_NBC
Sports_](http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2011/03/24/remote-control-
artificial-cloud-to-cool-spectators-at-2022-world-cup/), [_Fast

Mail_](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1369525/Artificial-

[_Engadget_](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/27/qatar-building-fleet-of-
remote-control-clouds-for-world-cup-20/), and
[_io9_](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/27/qatar-building-fleet-of-remote-
control-clouds-for-world-cup-20/), to name a few.

Perhaps the most amusing – and most retweeted – take on the story though, was
by _Yahoo! Sports_ : [Qatar stole its artificial cloud idea from television
cartoon The Simpsons](http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/blog/dirty-
tackle/post/Qatar-stole-its-artificial-cloud-idea-from-The-S?urn=sow-wp331).

In the legendary two-part 1995 episode entitled “Who Shot Mr. Burns?”
nefarious power plant owner C. Montgomery Burns devises a plan to create a
giant shield that will block the sun and keep Springfield in perpetual
darkness:

Still from The Simpsons cartoon television show.

Their claim that “while Qatar may have added their own twist … the core idea
is clearly ripped from a 16-year-old cartoon”, even illicited a response from
a former Simpsons show writer:

In its many iterations and reprints, the World Cup “cloud” story has garnered
thousands of tweets.

Others, however, have expressed exasperation at the seemingly endless life of
this thinly-sourced story:

> [@dohanews:](http://twitter.com/dohanews/status/51927348286734336) Is the

Whether or not this US $500,000 construction will be gracing the stadia of the
2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar though, remains to be seen.
