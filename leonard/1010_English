****The adoption of a child either within your own country or across borders
creates opportunities for children and prospective parents as well as risks
for human rights abuses. On the internet, people worldwide share varied
experiences from the point of view of adoptive mothers, birth mothers and
adoptees themselves. One thing most people seek, is more openness and dialogue
about a process with many consequences hidden from view.

**Babygate: trafficking children to cover demand**

Malinda, an adoptive mother of two Chinese girls, [writes in her blog
_Adoption Talk_ ](http://chinaadoptiontalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/adoption-
corruptiontrafficking-in-news.html)about the lengths some corrupt individuals
are going to ensure the steady flow of adoptable babies to people able to pay
the pricey adoption fees. In her post [_Adoption Corruption: Trafficking in
the news_](http://chinaadoptiontalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/adoption-
corruptiontrafficking-in-news.html) she highlights recent cases in
[Cameroon](http://allafrica.com/stories/200909160377.html), where children are
kidnapped in order to be placed for adoption;
[Korea](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/09/137_51865.html),
where young parents put their baby on sale on the Internet;
[Guatemala](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/09/12/guatemala.child.abduction/index.html),
where the army abducted and sold more than 333 children for adoption and where
recently babies and children were [put up for adoption without parental
consent](http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/39619); and
[Ethiopia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/15/2685853.htm), where
unregulated agencies are convincing families to give their children up for
adoption, promising them the children will later return to them or that the
agency will help support the remainder of the family. Similar cases have been
seen in numerous other countries.

**Mothers coming together to secure their human rights**

Some adoptive mothers do what they can to ensure one woman's right to
motherhood doesn't go against the reproductive rights of another mother.

One such option is open adoptions, a [sometimes
controversial](http://www.adoptionqa.com/blog/about-adoption/514/use-caution-
when-considering-a-fully-open-adoption/) decision where the child remains in
contact with the birth mother and is aware that due to other circumstances,
she wasn't able to take care of them.

One woman in the United States, Leigh, writes a blog called [Open Adoption
Round Table](http://sturdyyetfragile.blogspot.com/2009/06/open-adoption-
roundtable.html) about the challenges of giving her child up for adoption in a
semi-open arrangement.

Another blogger and writer Dawn Friedman[ tells a story in her
blog](http://www.thiswomanswork.com/2009/10/14/adoption-story/) from the
opposite perspective of adopting her daughter, Madison, while keeping an open
line of communication with the birth mother. Friedman is also an activist for
[adoption reform ](http://www.thiswomanswork.com/tag/adoption-reform/)in the
United States. She believes pregnancy counseling in unplanned pregnancies too
easily pushes women towards giving up their babies for adoption without
informing them adequately of how difficult it is. Friedman also recommends
that the process of adoption counseling should include a post-labor session
where women are accompanied through the decision making process and advised of
their rights and possibilities after giving birth, in case they are having
second thoughts or have additional concerns.

**Birth mothers  
**

[Lorraine Dusky](http://www.firstmotherforum.com/2009/10/would-updated-
medical-information-have.html) in the United States, who runs the _Birth
Mother, First Mother Forum_ [had medical
history](http://www.firstmotherforum.com/2009/10/would-updated-medical-
information-have.html) that made her think that birth control pills she took
during pregnancy could have affected the child she placed in adoption, but
when she tried to contact the adoptive family through the agency to let them
know, they refused to send over the information.

She relinquished her child with no particular coercion, but the laws for
“closed records” in adoptions may have cost her daughter's life.

But what about natural mothers in developing countries? Where are their
voices? Some of them have written letters to the children they've placed for
adoption, as Pam Conell of _[families.com](http://adoption.families.com)
_tells us in her [book review](http://adoption.families.com/blog/book-review-
i-wish-for-you-a-beautiful-life) of _I Wish for You a Beautiful Life: Letters
from the Korean birthmothers of Ae Ran Won._

Others are telling their stories through
[documentaries](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swm1rlAUmOk), or after being
[reunited with their natural
children](http://cedartrees.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/sorry-mrs-smith-looking-
beyond-the-story/). And there are some others who tell of women who don't
regret giving their children up for adoption, considering it was the best
alternative. However some women, like
[Malinda](http://chinaadoptiontalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/birth-mothers-and-
exotic-other.html) in the USA, adoptive parent of Chinese Girls who writes
[_AdoptionTalk_](http://chinaadoptiontalk.blogspot.com/2009/09/adoption-
corruptiontrafficking-in-news.html) believes that these last representations
have to be taken with a grain of salt:

> These representations of foreign birth mothers allow us to divorce ourselves
> from the experience of these birth mothers, to minimize their pain, and to
> justify how much better off our children are with us than with them.

**The Voices of the Adopted:**

The voices of the adoptees are as varied as any of the other parts of the
adoption triad. But in general they share some points of view in common: The
desire to know about their origins and the reason for their adoption and the
hope that their birth mothers made an informed decision to part with them.
They also believe in the right to know their history if they choose, to know
about their adoptee status from early on and have it acknowledged as part of
their identity.  

For example Susan from
[_ReadingWritingLiving_](http://readingwritingliving.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/mad-
men-a-window-into-my-own-past/), an adult adoptee born in the 1960's,
identified with TV drama Mad Men, particularly in their portrayal of adoptions
in that time period, where women hid their shameful unwanted pregnancies until
giving birth and how adopted children where seen as discards. She sums it up
in her post [_Mad Men: A Window into my Own
Past_](http://readingwritingliving.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/mad-men-a-window-
into-my-own-past/)  

> Yes, it was painful to hear this but also WILDLY refreshing to have someone
> just come out and SAY it.

In the [_I am adopted_ ](http://soyadoptado.wordpress.com)[es]blog in Spanish,
David Azcona writes about his difficult childhood, adoption at the age of 6
and the instability and [inability to bond with
people](http://soyadoptado.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/la-dificultad-de-apego/)
[es] he's felt since. It is also a place for other adoptees to post their
adoption stories, and to share their experiences. In the comment threads of
his about page, stories about [apropriated babies [es]
](http://soyadoptado.wordpress.com/enlaces/#comment-618)with no knowledge of
their birth parents, [twins separated at
birth](http://soyadoptado.wordpress.com/enlaces/#comment-440)[es] by nurses
who told parents [one of the babies had
died](http://soyadoptado.wordpress.com/enlaces/#comment-643)[es] and requests
from birth mothers trying to contact their children as well as the other way
around.

An [adoptee answers a
question](http://cedartrees.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/separated-by-adoption-
reality-the-adoptive-parent-experience/) asked on a website regarding love
between adoptees and adoptive parents:

> I was adopted as a baby by the two most loving, caring and supportive
> parents a child and young adult could ever wish for. I also have a younger
> adopted brother.
>
> I don't think my biological parents could have loved me more than my
> adoptive ones.

Other[ adoptees with similar experiences chime
in,](http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090515134207AAw9oCD)
some with relationships with both natural parents and adoptive parents and
others who have only known their adoptive families. In this particular thread,
the experiences are overwhelmingly positive towards adoption.

Some adoptees advocate against adoption. _Lost Letters_ , an adoptee herself
who writes in the [_Anti-Adoption_ livejournal
community](http://community.livejournal.com/anti_adoption/) believes that
instead of using so much money to aid in adoption processes and fees, it
should be spent in improving the conditions of the birth parents so they can
take care of their family. She adds:

> I understand that my _actual_ position on adoption is going to piss people
> off because people want to believe that adoption is a win/win/win situation
> for everyone, because people think that middle class white women deserve
> children no matter what, because people think that our western society is so
> wonderful that all children should be bought up here.

AmyAdoptee who posts in the _A[dult Adoptees Advocating for
Change](http://www.adultadoptees.org/forum/index.php?topic=17486.msg170814#msg170814)_
forum writes:

> The adoption industry intentionally pits us against each other. We are

[PhilM](http://www.adultadoptees.org/forum/index.php?topic=17486.msg170870#msg170870),
in the same forum thread discussing how adoptive parents perceive them,
clarifies:

**The way forward**

As with any delicate issue, it touches a sensitive chord for all those
involved: adoptive mothers, birth mothers and adopted children. However, it
seems they all meet and agree on one important point: Transparency in the
adoption process is vital to safeguard the human rights for the mothers and
the children, and discussing adoption openly encourages transparency.
