@Awadhi4: Today morning in Nuwaidrat. #Feb14 #Bahrain
http://yfrog.com/h25rhwkj

Bahrain was rocked by violence today as the latest country to stage protests
in the [so-called Arab revolution time-
table](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/01/arab-world-a-revolution-time-
table/) inspired by uprisings in Tunisa and Egypt. Police quashed
demonstrations in various cities today, and both
[videos](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/14/bahrain-police-quash-
todays-protests-videos/) and photos of the crackdown are dodging internet
censors, and making their way around the web.

At least one person has died.

News [began to circulate about a February 14
uprising](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/05/bahrain-valentines-day-or-
a-day-of-anger/) at the beginning of the month. Only days ago King Hamad,
Bahrain's monarch, announced that the government would be giving each family
in Bahrain a gift of BD1,000 (US$2,650) to mark the 10th anniversary of [the
country's return to constitutional
rule](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/National_Action_Charter_of_Bahrain).

[![Just Bahrain](http://mahmood.tv/wp-
content/uploads/2011/02/justbahraini-180-150x150.png)](http://mahmood.tv/2011/02/14/i-believe-
in-a-better-bahrain/)Bahrain is an oil-rich country with approximately 1.2
million inhabitants, located near the western shores of the Persian Gulf. The
country has a poor human rights record and very uneven distribution of wealth.
Adding to the trouble is strong sectarian tension between Shiites (majority)
and Sunnis (minority, power-holders). The bigotry is often visible on Twitter,
as are also [online efforts to quell
disagreement](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/12/bahrain-fighting-
sectarian-bigotry-head-on/). Although Bahrain is small, it is [strategically
important to the United
States](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/02/14/peter-goodspeed-
trouble-in-tiny-bahrain-carries-big-implications/) as the home to the U.S.
Navy’s Fifth Fleet and a close neighbor to Saudia Arabia and Iran.

**Snapshots from a day of turmoil**

Throughout the day, there were messages and photos on Twitter showing the
demonstrators’ perspective of events (See hashtag
[#14Feb](https://twitter.com/#!/search/14feb)). Several people posted updates
about major roads and intersections being closed. [Najeel Rajab has posted
photos](https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=274586&id=687160937) on
Facebook showing multiple injuries sustained today.
