recent death of four park rangers in Iran has stirred Iranian environmental
bloggers. The four men were shot dead in a village in Sanandaj in Iran's
Kuridstan. Bloggers were invited by a leading pro-environment website, _[Green
Wave](http://greenday.ir)_ (photo above) to write about the topic: “Iran's
nature, a place where park rangers are sacrificed. Why?” from March 6-13.

In _Lor_ ‘s blog we [read](http://lor.bloglor.com/post360.html) [fa]:

> What are the reasons for the death of six park rangers in one year? The
> responsibility of all pro-environment activists is clear. We should support
> these park rangers in order to prevent such events in future.

_Rifr_ blog [says ](http://rifr.blogfa.com/post-249.aspx) [fa]

> What happened that these four park rangers should deserve to die? Their guns
> were not ready and it shows they did not expect such an attack. We should
> remember that in the last 30 years, 110 park rangers were killed and 450
> others were handicapped.

> One of the victims was Kamal Hussein Panahi, a student of natural resources.
> He shared his experience with other students. Is it right that a nature and
> environment lover and keeper should become a target of bullets?
