December 19, [the 2010 presidential
election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_presidential_election,_2010)
day in Belarus, ended in mass protests, arrests and violent clashes with the
riot police in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

[Aleksandr Lukashenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko), who
has served as the President of Belarus since July 1994, ran against nine
opposition candidates, some of whom are [now reported to have been attacked or
arrested – or both](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/12/19/AR2010121900474.html?hpid=topnews). Thousands
of people gathered in the center of Minsk to protest electoral fraud after the
polls closed (some photos and video are
[here](http://www.belaruspartisan.org/bp-
forte/?page=100&backPage=13&news=73221&newsPage=0)), but as they tried to
storm the government headquarters and the central election commission
building, they were soon dispersed by riot police. Dozens of protesters and a
number of journalists, [including a reporter and a photographer for the New
York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/world/europe/20belarus.html?ref=global-
home), were injured.

Problems with the internet and limited access to social media and opposition
websites in Minsk were being reported throughout the day, too (see earlier GV
updates by Alexey Sidorenko –
[here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/12/19/belarus-gmail-twitter-
livejournal-facebook-and-other-sites-blocked/),
[here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/12/19/belarus-users-are-redirected-
to-fake-opposition-websites/), and
[here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/12/19/hal-roberts-commentary-on-
internet-censorship-in-belarus/)). Evgeny Morozov ( _@evgenymorozov_ ), who is
currently in Belarus,
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/evgenymorozov/status/16520594707189760) that
he couldn't “access anything using https.” In another tweet, posted Sunday
afternoon, he
[wrote](http://twitter.com/#!/evgenymorozov/status/16524276748255233):

> I also hear that since access to Gmail in Belarus is blocked, opposition
> sites can't use their mailing lists

Still, citizen media reports were being filed before, during and after the
events in the center of Minsk.

On Dec. 18, Dmitry Rastaev (LJ user _rastaev_ )
[commented](http://rastaev.livejournal.com/58723.html) (RUS) on the supposedly
voluntary “early voting” – in which “[23% of the 7 million registered
electors](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/20/belarus-protest-alleged-
vote-rigging)” had cast their votes, and which is often considered “[an
instrument of vote-rigging for
authorities](http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20101219/161841213.html)“:

> Talked with my [student] daughter [via ICQ] today, she said this: “ _In the
> dormitory, they are coming into the rooms with the Eviction Act and write
> down [the names of] all those who didn't vote early on this piece of paper,
> putting “for [creating insanitary conditions]” as the reason_.”

> And in the meantime, [Lukashenko] and his clique are barking on the TV about

LJ user _adelka_ [posted this
report](http://adelka.livejournal.com/261261.html) (BEL) after she returned
from the rally:

LJ user _aneta-spb_ , a St. Petersburg-based journalist who came to Minsk to
cover the election, posted these updates (RUS) from the rally:
