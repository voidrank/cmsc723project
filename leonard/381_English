According to media reports, corruption and unfinished facilities may mar
Slovakia's chances to hold a successful
[Deaflympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaflympics) this month. Problems
were known to exist as far back as last spring, and doubts and controversy
remain even today.

On May 17, 2010, USA Deaf Sports Federation
[reported](http://www.usdeafsports.org/news/news_20100517.html) that “[i]n
response to the lack of planning, securing of funding, and other issues
regarding the 17th Winter Deaflympics, the International Committee of Sports
for the Deaf (ICSD) has canceled the 2011 Winter Deaflympics that were to take
place next February in Slovakia.”

However, two months later, on July 23, the Slovak Deaflympics Committee
[announced](http://www.2011deaflympics.org/en/clanok/26-information-of-the-
slovak-deaflympic-committee) “that the 17th Winter Deaflympic Games 2011 in
[[Vysoke Tatry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Tatras)]/Slovakia will be
held in the date of 18th-26th February 2011 were approved by the ICSD
proceedings regarding the positive results of the inspection.”

A few days ago, on Feb. 6, the Organising Committee of the 17th Winter
Deaflympics [issued a
statement](http://www.2011deaflympics.org/en/clanok/51-statement-of-the-
organizing-committee-of-the-17th-winter-deaflympics-2011-in-vysoke-tatry-
dated-on-february-6-2011), claiming that, despite all the problems, the Games
will be held “as scheduled” – but “with the respect of the real situation will
be realized the minimized budget.” Also, according to the statement, the
“negotiated construction of the winter stadiums in
[[Levoča](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levo%C4%8Da)] and
[[Kežmarok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ke%C5%BEmarok)] will be realized
according to the schedule, even if the Deaflympics will not take place on
them.”

Igor Šajtlava, the major of Kežmarok, [has a different
opinion](http://www.pluska.sk/sport/ostatne/deaflympiada-bude-minimalizovanym-
rozpoctom.html), however:

> […] I am 100% sure that the stadium in Kežmarok will be not finished and it
> is even questionable whether the Deaflympics will take place at all. […]

Additionally, the city of Levoča announced in late January its intention to
sue the Slovak Deaflympics Committee and the developer company because of the
unfinished stadium in Levoča.

SME [describes](http://sport.sme.sk/c/5755202/deaflympiadu-jej-sef-odsudil-na-
samovrazdu.html) Jaromír Ruda, head of the Slovak Organising Committee, as a
champion of promises and someone who is accused of a 1.6 million Euro
Deaflympics-related fraud. The newspaper claims that Ruda has no agreement
with any stadium, and even all his hotel reservations in High Tatras have
allegedly been canceled. The only promise he has kept until now is the 2008
World Deafympics Congress in Bratislava – though some bills from that event
haven't been covered yet (and Ruda did not attend the Congress personally –
because at that time he was in prison).

Below are some of the readers’ comments to the SME article linked to above:

_lost_boy_ :

> A man who has embezzled 1.6 million Euro still works – two years later – for
> the organization he had robbed and has the main voice in such decisions as
> the organization of the [Deaflympics] event. Welcome to the banana republic

_wayne_rooney_ :

> Oh God, where we are living… That will be big shame again :(

_Jumo (in reply)_ :

> This shame will fall on the organizer. No one else has anything to do with
> it.

_yoss_ :

> To feel ashamed of it is the same nonsense as to be proud of one's own
> country. One can only feel proud or ashamed for the things he has made or
> raised oneself.

_halface_ :

> The state is responsible for this. That man has to be in prison for a long
> time – instead of still making promises and stealing.

_dukovany_ :

> Put prison garb on him… in front of all those athletes… to let him perform
> the gala opening and then work till the end of his life at repairing of the
> half-ruined stadiums in Kežmarok and Bardejov… Shame, I do not understand
> how such a man can sleep, if it is his mistake…

_New Bobko_ :

> Slovakia should definitively stop applying for the right to organise any
> international events. Usually we lose money and end up embarrassed.

_Pietro Mennea (in reply)_ :

> But why? Some people will make big money from that. [We are such a small
> nation, so] there's hope that eventually we all can have our share of it.

_Iohan-Amos Comenius_ :

> Something doesn't make sense here. It does not seem likely to me that the
> Olympics could depend on one person.

_sarapes_ :

> It is deafpolice and deafjudge.
