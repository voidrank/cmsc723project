On the eve of the United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen, the
scientific community that studies global warming has recently come under the
spotlight. The reason: hundreds of emails and documents spanning exchanges
between officials from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of
East Anglia (UEA) between 1996 and 2009, have recently been hacked and posted
online, as [confirmed by the _New York
Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/science/earth/21climate.html?_r=2).

According to climate change skeptics, the emails supposedly offer evidence
that scientists manipulated data to match predictions of temperature changes
made by computers. The scandal has already become popularly known as
“[Climategate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climategate)” although many
scientists and bloggers insist it appears to be a case of attempted political
manipulation.

**Documents hacked**

The [emails](http://www.eastangliaemails.com/index.php) and documents have
been posted on a Russian server, and continue to be shared on many websites
and over the P2P networks.

_Robert Graham_ , a specialist in computer security,
[issued](http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2009/11/hacker-exposes-global-
warming.html), on his website _Errata Security_ , a few assumptions about the
hacker:

> The data is oddly specific. Only Phil Jones e-mails were copied, and a lot
> of the data that was hacked is specific to certain climate controversies. If
> it was not an insider, it was certainly somebody familiar with the central
> debate about reproducibility of climate reconstructions. The fact that they
> posted the data to an anonymous FTP site in Russia also points to somebody
> who is active in the hacking community. This narrows things down. I suspect
> that at the end of the data, they'll find some sort of computer
> administrator working for CRU.

The CRU quickly acknowledged the theft and the authenticity of documents,
through the voice of its director Phil Jones, one of the main participants in
the scandal.

**“Mike's Nature trick”**

The climate change skeptics have seized on Climategate as evidence that there
is room for doubt about the reality of global warming. Several blogs and news
websites [have linked
to](http://bishophill.squarespace.com/blog/2009/11/20/climate-
cuttings-33.html) the “suspicious” emails. [An
email](http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=154&filename=942777075.txt)
from [Phil Jones](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/pjones/) got the full
treatment on several blogs and news websites for mentioning something called
“Mike's Nature trick” that refers to a “trick” used by Michael Mann to “mask a
decline” (instead of an expected rise) in temperature. “Did they invent the
numbers?” asks Sophie Verney-Caillat on
_[Rue89.com](http://www.rue89.com/2009/11/23/le-climategate-de-la-recherche-
sur-le-rechauffement-127022)_ [fr].

Skeptics have their answer. Jean S, on the website _ClimateAudit_ , [shows
graphs](http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=7810) from several different sources
that help illustrate claims of data manipulation.

**A coordinated manipulation**

Lubos Motl Pilsen, who describes himself as a “conservative physicist” on his
blog _The Reference Frame_ , says he
[read](http://motls.blogspot.com/2009/11/hacked-hadley-cru-foi2009-files.html)
through the files and emails thoroughly. He sees evidence that scientist not
only invented data, but also manipulated stakeholders. He found a file
“explaining 20 recommendations for a good propagandist”, on how to “use
emotions”, the necessity to “connect alarm with ‘home’ not with ‘faraway
regions’, and so on”. Additionally, he writes, “the climate scientists also
synchronize their efforts to block certain papers from being published, or
even eliminate a journal ([Climate Research](http://www.int-
res.com/journals/cr/)) from a _de facto_ list of peer-reviewed journals”.

This plot to discredit climate change science has been enabled by mainstream
media, according to bloggers who reprimand their stance. Vincent Bénard, on
his blog _Objectif Liberté_ (Destination Freedom),
[describes](http://www.objectifliberte.fr/2009/11/climategate-3.html) [fr] how
(french) media failed to follow-up:

> Par contre, il est tout à fait regrettable que les médias, et notamment les
> médias hexagonaux, adoptent sur ces questions, de façon quasi pavlovienne,
> la thèse des chercheurs du GIEC. Ils adoptent de ce fait une posture
> purement idéologique et oublient toutes les bases du journalisme sérieux:
> vérification de l'authenticité (faite par le New York Times et ses pairs
> anglo-américains), analyse, recoupements, et conclusions. Nos journalistes
> environnementaux écrivent d'abord la conclusion, puis l'habillent d'analyses
> à l'emporte pièce, en tenant pour acquis un seul point de vue et en
> dénigrant par avance toute opposition.

It is quite unfortunate that the media, including french media, jump on these
questions about the thesis of the IPCC scientists, in an almost Pavlovian way.
Their stance is purely ideological and they forget all the basis of
journalism: confirmation of authenticity (by the New York Times and its Anglo-
American peers), analysis, crosschecks, and conclusions. Our environmental
journalists write the conclusion first, and then adorn it with smart analyses,
assuming a single point of view and belittling any opposition in advance.

**“Much Ado About Nothing”?**

UEA and CRU have refuted the charges that any of their data is false. In [an
article](http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/homepagenews/CRUupdate)
posted on the website of the university, they state that 95% of climatic data
collected has been published. According to them, “… there is nothing in the
material stolen which indicates that peer-reviewed publications by CRU, and
others, on the nature of global warming and related climate change are not of
the highest-quality of scientific investigation and interpretation.”

According to
[_ClimateChange_](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/the-
cru-hack/), a group blog by American and European scientists, the plot the
skeptics claim to have unveiled is nowhere to be found:

> There is no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy, no mention of George Soros
> nefariously funding climate research, no grand plan to ‘get rid of the MWP’,
> no admission that global warming is a hoax, no evidence of the falsifying of
> data, and no ‘marching orders’ from our socialist / communist / vegetarian
> overlords. The truly paranoid will put this down to the hackers also being
> in on the plot though.

Concerning the Mike's Nature trick, they state that's all about vocabulary :

> Scientists often use the term “trick” to refer to a “a good way to deal with
> a problem”, rather than something that is “secret”, and so there is nothing
> problematic in this at all.

**The Newtongate**

The blog _Carbon Fixated_ , dedicated to photosynthesis and climate change,
dismissed the plot with humour. He
[imagined](http://carbonfixated.com/newtongate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-
of-renaissance-and-enlightenment-thinking/) what would happen if letters from
Newton to other scientists had been made public:

> If you own any shares in companies that produce reflecting telescopes, use
> differential and integral calculus, or rely on the laws of motion, [you]
> should start dumping them NOW. The conspiracy behind the calculus myth has
> been suddenly, brutally and quite deliciously exposed after volumes of
> Newton’s private correspondence were compiled and published.

**Transparency**

It is unclear what impact Climategate will have on the Copenhagen summit, but
we can hope it may at least have had a positive effect of encouraging
transparent debate, as
[suggested](http://http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm) by the famous
American physicist [Richard
Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) in 1974:

> It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
> corresponds to a kind of utter honesty – a kind of leaning over backwards.
> For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything
> that you think might make it invalid–not only what you think is right about
> it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you
> thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they
> worked – to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.”
