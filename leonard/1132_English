The trailer for the documentary called “[South of the
Border](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337137/)” from U.S. filmmaker [Oliver
Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone), which profiles Venezuelan
President Hugo Chávez, has been a topic within Venezuelan blogosphere. Many
are speculating on the content of the film based on the trailer, as it has yet
to be released in Venezuela. On one hand, some bloggers believe that this
documentary will favor the President and will allow him to respond to the
negative press that he receives at home and abroad. On the other hand, other
bloggers believe that the film will not show both sides of the story.

Carlos Caridad-Montero of _Blogacine [es]_ notes that the documentary[ is a
“portrait of the Venezuelan
President”](http://www.blogacine.com/2009/09/03/oliver-stone-presenta-el-
trailer-de-su-documental-sobre-chavez/) and includes the thoughts from other
Latin American leaders, who make an appearance, such as Argentine President
Cristina Kirchner, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, and Bolivian President
Evo Morales, among others. According to Caridad-Montero, many of these leaders
share his ideology.

The choice of leaders invited to participate in the documentary is not lost on
Julia of the blog [_Anti-Patriotic
Venezuela_](http://www.blogacine.com/2009/09/03/oliver-stone-presenta-el-
trailer-de-su-documental-sobre-chavez/), [who
writes](http://antipatrioticvenezuelan.blogspot.com/2009/09/oliver-stone-on-
chavez.html):

> Maybe is a very objective documentary that tries to show the true face of
> Chavez and other South American leaders beyond what's been told about them
> in the -so called – “mainstream media”. But in such face of the South
> American change, people like Uribe from Colombia or Alan from Peru were not

The film was released at the [Venice Film
Festival](http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/) in early September, and was
recently screened in New York City at an event attended by Chávez, who was in
town for the United Nations General Assembly.

Harold of the blog _Panfleto Negro [es]_ provides a hard critique of the
filmmaker and writes about Stone's “[desperate cry for
attention.”](http://www.panfletonegro.com/volante/2009/09/08/el-desesperado-
intento-de-oliver-stone-por-llamar-la-atencion/) He adds that Stone's other
profile pieces have not portrayed the entire story, and believes that this one
will not be any different:

> Lo de Stone el día de ayer en la alfombra roja con Chávez es, a todas luces,
> un desgarrador grito por atención. Y es que Stone lleva años tratando de
> crear “polémica” para hacer prensa a como de lugar. Desde su apología a la
> figura de Fidel Castro en Comandante, hasta las críticas a los presidentes
> republicanos como en la nombrada W, o en la mucho más antigua Nixon. Ni las
> excelentes actuaciones de Josh Brolin o Anthony Hopkins pudieron rescatar la
> mediocridad de ambas cintas…

What Stone did yesterday in the red carpet was, evidently, a heartbreaking cry
for attention. Stone has been trying to create “controversy” to be in the
press at any price. From his apologist piece on Fidel Castro's in the film
Comandante, to the critique of Republican presidents, as in the well-known
film W or in the much older film Nixon. Neither the excellent performances of
Josh Brolin nor Anthony Hopkins could rescue the mediocrity of both films…

The blog _Waiting for Godot [es]_ [ guesses that the documentary was made with
the money from the Venezuelan State.](http://waitingfor-
godot.blogspot.com/2009/09/stone-mejor-hubieras-llevado-algo-de.html) The
blogger adds that Stone should have made an action film in Venezuela, so that
people can see what really happens in the country.

> NO, Oliver Stone, no podemos ver tu película como un documental informativo,
> porque a nosotros un Chávez como el que presentas igualado a una promesa de
> futuro es tan ficción como el que tú seas un hombre revolucionario y
> socialista.

NO, Oliver Stone, we cannot see your film as an informative documentary,
because to use, the Chávez that you present as the same as a promise of the
future is as fictitious as you are a revolutionary and socialist man.

However, the blog _Aporrea [es]_ writes about [the contrast in reception
received by Chávez at the film festivals and what is happening in some social
networking sites](http://www.aporrea.org/venezuelaexterior/n141934.html):

> La calurosa acogida al líder venezolano contrastó con la fría y escasa
> respuesta que días atrás tuvo en Europa y el resto del mundo la convocatoria
> a marchas bajo la consigna “No más Chávez”, promovida por la derecha
> internacional a través de la página de internet Facebook.

The warm welcome given to the Venezuelan leader contrasted with the cold and
weak response from the demonstrations against him under the banner “No more
Chavez,” promoted by the International Right through Facebook

Some blogs from abroad are also providing their thoughts on how the film will
help balance the message about Chávez. Canadian Sabina Becker of _News of the
Restless_ [writes](http://www.hollow-
hill.com/sabina/2009/09/thisll_shut_em_up.html):

> All weekend long we've been hearing nothing in the news but how everybody
> and their dog is out marching against that “evil dictator Chávez” (o rly?)
> Well, finally the media have woken up to the fact that there's another side
> to the story.
>
> (…)
>
> Er. Actually, it's not evil at all. It's good, isn't it? Yes, absolutely. So
> why's it taken so long for the media to catch on? Well, they didn't have
> Ollie Stone to interview. And they couldn't very well break the news on his
> latest doc without talking to the man. And oh, bad luck for them–every word
> out of his mouth has been nothing but good about Chavecito, and slams for
> his detractors.
