Australian Senator Nick Xenophon was detained for 15 hours at the Kuala Lumpur
airport in Malaysia before being
[deported](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/2/18/nation/12725174&sec=nation)
after he was accused of being an ‘enemy of the state.’ Malaysian officials
said Xenophon “could cause disorder and could be a danger to the community.”

Xenophon was scheduled to meet with Malaysia’s Opposition leaders and to
prepare as election observer this year. He participated in the
[Bersih](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/04/24/malaysia-prepares-for-
bersih-3-0-sit-down-protest/) rally a few months ago, a massive street
demonstration attended by Opposition personalities.

Xenophon is reported to be the
[first](http://anilnetto.com/governance/accountability/xenophon-plans-to-
frame-deportation-notice/) Australian MP to be deported from any country. The
Australian government has expressed
[disappointment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cSstCeToE_g)
over the decision of Malaysia to deport Xenophon.

> all Malaysians regardless of political affiliation.

Tholu asks how a democracy like Malaysia can’t even [tolerate
criticism](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/221614):

> If PM Najib Razak's regime can't even tolerate a comment made in disfavour
> of our government's running of the country by a national of a foreign
> country, how can we trust it to transform Malaysia into a modern, developed
> and truly democratic nation with their attendant attributes of free speech
> and expression and an impeccable human rights record?

Is the government [hiding
something](http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/221579), writes Tan Zhong Yan

> Maybe Xenophon is right in saying that the Malaysian government is being
> authoritarian as this has again proves that the government is not able to
> accept criticism.
>
> The deportation of Xenophon also casts doubt as to what the government is
> trying to hide as the government need not be afraid if everything is
> transparent.

Aliran echoes the view that the deportation is
[unjustified](http://aliran.com/11601.html):

> Was the deportation related to the senator’s honest criticism of the
> government’s unwarranted ‘authoritarian’ treatment of Bersih? If that is the
> case, it is indeed deplorable especially coming from the Najib
> administration, which once proudly claimed that Malaysia was the best
> democracy in the world. Surely, any criticism in a thriving democracy, as
> opposed to a dictatorship, doesn’t warrant the unjustified deportation of
> critics

But Xenophon was also
[criticized](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/2/18/nation/20130218113231&sec=nation)
for interfering in the domestic affairs of Malaysia. Rocky's Bru publishes a
piece written by RL who reminds Xenophon that he
[violated](http://www.rockybru.com.my/2013/02/the-real-reasons-why-australian-
senator.html) Malaysia’s domestic law when he participated in a rally a few
months ago:

> …if Xenophon sought to participate as an international observer in
> Malaysia’s elections, he should have not taken part in illegal street
> rallies in this country, and he should have adhered to the stipulations
> required within Malaysian law by applying to be a recognized observer.
>
> Malaysians should also not forget the long reach of deportation power in
> Australian law, which routinely grants persona non grata status to non-
> Australians for minor offences. Xenophon’s deportation is an unfortunate
> incident, but foreigners are required to abide by Malaysian law if they wish
> to have some kind of presence observing elections or staying in the country,
> otherwise, it is perfectly acceptable for the authorities to take action in
> safeguarding political affairs from intrusive foreign elements.
