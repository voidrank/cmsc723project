In the two months that have followed the ousting of former Tunisian President
Ben Ali by [revolutionary
protests](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/), four United States (US) officials have visited Tunisia:
Jeffrey Feltman, the assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs,
William Burns, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, and
Senators Joseph Lieberman and John McCaine. On the night of Wednesday 15
March, 2011, US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton arrived in capital Tunis
after a trip to Egypt.

In Egypt, the _25 January Revolution Youth Coalition_ [refused an
invitation](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/7720/Egypt/Politics-/Revolution-
Youth-Coalition-refuses-to-meet-Clinton.aspx) to meet with Clinton,”due to her
negative stance towards the revolution during its inception and the approach
of the US Administration towards the Middle East Region,” as the [Coalition
states](http://bikyamasr.com/wordpress/?p=30571). The reaction to the visit of
Hilary Clinton in Tunisia did not differ much from Egypt.

Indeed, on Wednesday and Thursday there were protests in Tunis against the
visit. Protestors see Hilary Clinton's visit to Tunisia as the height of
hypocrisy, considering that the US government was known to be an ally of Ben
Ali's regime.

About one hundred Tunisians demonstrated yesterday in Tunis to denounce the
visit of the State Secretary Hillary Clinton. “Clinton Out”, “No to the
American presence in Tunisia”, chanted the protestors near the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, holding anti-American banners.

He also reports that the police used force against peaceful protestors:

Anti-American protestors also claim that there is a hidden agenda behind the
visit of Hillary Clinton. Twitter user Nizar Moalla [
(@NIZARMO)](http://twitter.com/NIZARMO) asked the following question on March
17:

Do you think that Hillary Clinton has visited both Egypt and Tunisia to make
it easier for them to use our air bases??

I'm afraid that Clinton is here to negociate for a rear base in Tunisia to
attack Libya and same thing for Egypt

Hillary Clinton should know we want our own democracy and not the kind of
democracy that she wants for us

Clinton is looking for another dictator for Tunisia or Egypt. Get out..

On the night of Thursday March 17, Hilary Clinton appeared on a talk show on a
private Tunisian network television station[ _Nessma
TV_](http://www.nessma.tv/hillary_clinton_on_nessma_tv.php). The talk show did
not satisfy viewers who considered it as too shallow and not targeting the
main issues.
