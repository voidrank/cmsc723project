A few years ago when the [Fourth King of
Bhutan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck) voluntarily
stepped down to make way for democracy, there was a spate of articles in the
media about Bhutan. Almost all these articles – with a few exceptions – could
be grouped into two camps: one glorified Bhutan as the last [Shangri-
la](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangri_La), the others claimed that it
practiced [ethnic
cleansing](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iC0U6PbCJd1gA08Qoz9kBhj-6ZuA).

_The National Geographic_ aired a documentary which named Bhutan, the tiny
Buddhist kingdom as [the world's last Shangri-
La](http://www.mininova.org/tor/1504012). It celebrated its mountains, glacial
walls, alpine highlands and misty forests and mentioned “Bhutan is a Living
Eden where respect for life, in all its many incarnations, endures like the
land itself”.

Most of these writers, if not all, were not Bhutanese. So how is it that they
came to view this small country – the size of Switzerland and a population of
600,000 – in such extremes?

The first group, the admirers, usually came from the west where capitalism has
led to a way of life that may have equipped them with material contents, but
left many with a gaping spiritual void. They are people seeking for things
they do not find in their own cultures; yet find it elsewhere. Often in places
like Bhutan – largely mysterious, exotic and peaceful. So when they find it,
they tend to see only the things they want to see and find only the things
they want to find.

But this also applies to the second camp, the ones who hate Bhutan. They have
little or no understanding of the country’s geo-political situation. They
don’t understand the history or the complex nature of the refugee problem; and
they are either sympathizing with the cause, or they just need a cause.

For the first camp, the search for Shangri-la didn’t just happen; it has been
ongoing since 1933 when James Hilton depicted a Shangri-la in his novel, [Lost
Horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Horizon_%28novel%29) based on an
article by Joseph Rock about his travels to the Tibetan borderlands. But more
often than not, it is Hilton’s version that they are after thus refusing to
see Bhutan as a country like any other – inhabited by human beings, with its
share of problems.

Bhutan is far from being the Utopia despite its largely tranquil history. As a
poor country Bhutan has its share of social problems and challenges and the
biggest blight to its good reputation so far has been the issue of the
refugees.

A nation-wide census in the 80’s found thousands of illegal settlers along the
country’s southern borders. Most of these people were Nepalese people from
Nepal and India who came to Bhutan seeking economic opportunities and utilize
the large tracts of free agricultural land along porous borders. Free health
and educational facilities were also an added attraction. At around this time,
some [Lhotsampas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhotshampas) (Ethnic Nepali-
speaking Bhutanese) who were educated by the Bhutanese government in overseas
universities like Harvard and Cambridge returned to Bhutan nursing their own
political ambitions.

The problem came to a head when the Bhutanese government demanded all illegal
settlers, leave the country. This decision was opposed by the ambitious
Lhotsampa leaders who sympathized with the settlers and so mobilized protests
against the Bhutanese government demanding democracy and overthrow of the
monarch. The environment to nurse their political ambitions was extremely
favorable. They galvanized the southern people’s discontent with [violent
protests](http://www.bhutannica.org/index.php?title=Kuensel_Report) in which
they decapitated heads of two Bhutanese and planted them at a government
office. The Bhutanese government who had never experienced anything like this
cracked down and arrested many of the leaders while some escaped to Nepal.

What resulted was a situation where both sides accused the other of what
unfolded. Lhotsampas claim that anybody who was Nepali-speaking was forced out
of the country. As the [Bhutanese Community of South Australia
blog](http://bhutanesesa.blogspot.com/2009_05_01_archive.html) mentions:

The Bhutanese government claimed that while some were asked to leave, many
citizens left voluntarily under threats from their own leaders. Bhutan’s first
democratically elected Prime Minister _[Jigme Y.
Thinley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Thinley)_
[wrote](http://www.bhutannica.org/index.php?title=Bhutan:_A_Kingdom_Besieged)
at _Bhutannica_ :

The story got complicated as the refugees arrived in Nepal. UNHCR set up camps
for the [Bhutanse refugees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutanese_refugees)
in which free food and stipend was given and in a few years the numbers rose
from 5000 (1991) to 100,000. The handouts attracted many people other than
Bhutanese to those camps as more than half of Nepal's population live on less
than a dollar a day.

Ethnic cleansing is a very serious charge. People who make that accusation
about Bhutan should visit the country and see that thousands of Nepali-
speaking people still live and work there; that even before the crisis the
Fourth King encouraged integration of the ethnic groups through inter marriage
with special cash incentives. Many even hold very senior positions in the
government.

So what is Bhutan? A ‘Shangri-La’ or ‘ethnic cleanser'? Neither, is the
answer. And it would be nice if people really stopped imposing their dreams of
an Eden, or their disillusionment of failed political causes and ambitions, on
this little Country.
