![WAVE](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2011/01/women.jpg)[Women Aloud Videoblogging for
Empowerment](http://www.waveindia.org/index.php) (WAVE) is a platform and
program aiming to get women from semi-urban areas of India to voice their
opinions on topics that matter to them through online video tools.

[WAVE's tagline](http://www.waveindia.org/waveis.php?silverheader=0) reads:
“30 women, 30 regions, videoblogging every day”, and indeed, there are many
different videos on the site covering a wide range of topics from what seems
to be [every region in India](http://www.waveindia.org/bloggers.php). The
women who participate were chosen by universities or NGO's to be a part of a 9
month mentorship program where they were provided with training, equipment and
a stipend in exchange for their videos.

> WAVE’s philosophy is that young women in India need to be heard and
> encouraged to analyze the problems in their communities and go on to become
> leaders who provide effective solutions in order for society to become
> socially and economically empowered.

Twenty-four year old [Chinju Prakash](http://www.waveindia.org/bio.php?bid=9)
from Trivandrum, Kerala works for SPACE, an NGO developing and delivering
programs in New Media and Information Communication Technology. In [one of her
videos](http://www.waveindia.org/videopl.php?vid=249) she shows us the
Kalavara, a canteen run exclusively by women and we get to hear what the
experience has been like for these women who are now able to make a living for
themselves.

[Preeti Jain](http://www.waveindia.org/bio.php?bid=11) is a 27 year old from
Bilaspur, Chattisgarh. Through her videos she aims to focus on an indigenous
community of Chattisgarh to raise awareness about their issues. In[ this next
video](http://www.waveindia.org/videopl.php?vid=197), she focuses on their odd
customs for arranging marriages: departing from the norm in India, the young
men of the Baiga tribe meet and choose their wife during social events such as
dances, and then let their parents know.

[Salam Babina Devi](http://www.waveindia.org/bio.php?bid=8) is from Imphal,
Manipur and volunteers full time at a grassroots organization dealing with
women and child development. Her videos focus on cultural aspects of Manipur,
like this [next example on
dance](http://www.waveindia.org/videopl.php?vid=245):

> In Manipur every significant social and religious event is celebrated with
> its special form of dance. Here are glimpses of tribal, folk and classical
> dances from the hills and valley of an ancient land.
