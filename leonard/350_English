Mexico and France have had [growing problems in their diplomatic
relations](http://www.france24.com/en/20110215-franco-mexican-relations-turn-
icy-over-Florence-Cassez) due to the [kidnapping
conviction](http://www.mexicotoday.com.mx/en/headlines-footer-
links-34/2516-appeals-court-upholds-french-womans-kidnapping-conviction.html)
of a French national in Mexico City. Her name is [Florence
Cassez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cassez), and she was arrested in
2006, accused of kidnapping charges and sentenced to 60 years in prison.

Cassez's boyfriend was a leader of a gang called “Los Zodiacos” (meaning the
zodiacs), and in several testimonies the kidnapped recognized her as part of
the gang.

In 2009, French President [Nicolas
Sarkozy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy) visited Mexico and
asked for Cassez's release during his time in the country. Cassez could have
been sent to France but Mexican authorities refused to let her go, pressured
by “anti-kidnapping” national organizations. Their argument was based on their
distrust that French authorities would alter her sentence in her home country.
The blog [_AguaChile_](http://aguachile.blogspot.com/2011/02/french-diplomacy-
not-what-it-was.html) describes the pressure the Mexican government faced from
these organizations:

> In Mexico, notably, prominent anti-kidnapping NGOs such as Isabel Miranda de
> Wallace”s _Alto al Secuestro_ , Alejandro Martí's _México SOS_ and María
> Elena Morera's _Causa en Común_ , are [convinced
> ](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/183595.html)of Cassez’ culpability
> and call on the French President, the mercurial Nicolas Sarkozy, to stay out
> of the case.

This year, “[The Year of Mexico in
France](http://us.franceguide.com/event/2011-the-Year-of-Mexico-in-
France.html?NodeID=406&EditoID=228406)” is to be celebrated with a sequence of
more than 350 cultural and trade events programmed throughout 2011. France
initially said it would move forward with the events and use them, in part, to
draw attention to Cassez’s plight. Mexican authorities have announced [they
will not support](http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Mexico-to-boycott-French-
festival-over-Cassez-spat-1013570.php) the “Year of Mexico” proceedings and
will not transfer Cassez.

On Twitter, citizens from all over the world have raised their voices.

tweeted that Sarkozy's decision was based on popularity:

> Francia – Mexico Cassez objeto d discordia, ocacionado p politicos franceses
> q no encuentran como subir popularidad en elecciones proximas

France – Mexico Cassez fight caused by French politicians that do not know how
to raise their popularity in upcoming elections

Santo García
[(@Santo_)](http://twitter.com/#!/Santo_/status/41365524541747201) makes a
joke out of the situation:

> @[Sarkozy](http://twitter.com/Sarkozy) te cambio una Cassez por una Bruni??
> jalas o te pandeas??

@[Sarkozy](http://twitter.com/Sarkozy) I will exchange Cassez for
[Bruni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Bruni)? Are you in or not?

Ximena Vega expresses an optimist point of view in the blog [_Vivir
Mexico_](http://vivirmexico.com/2011/02/florence-cassez-se-acaba-el-amor-
entre-mexico-y-francia) [es], writing about the lessons Mexican society should
learn from the situation:

> Me parece que una gran lección que México debe aprender de todo esto, además
> de que Sarkozy haría cualquier cosa por aumentar su nivel de popularidad de
> ese vergonzoso 38%, es que se deben vigilar los procesos de preservación de
> la escena del crimen y toma de declaraciones. Una **policía federal y
> estatal mejor capacitada y más profesional** puede ser la gran diferencia
> entre un juicio exitoso y, bueno, una crisis diplomática o un secuestrador
> en libertad.

I think that a great lesson Mexico should learn from all this, besides that
Sarkozy would do anything to increase his popularity from that shameful 38%,
is that crime scenes should be monitored, as well as declarations and
statements. A **federal and state police that are better trained, and are more
professional,** can make a big difference between a successful prosecution
and, well, a diplomatic crisis or a released kidnapper.
