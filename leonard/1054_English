In many countries, October is breast cancer prevention month, an event that is
celebrated with dedicated websites, special television programs, lectures,
medical conferences, and the distribution of pamphlets and flyers with
information of interest. These resources always emphasize the importance of
self-examinations and what risk factors should be considered.

In the Dominican Republic, there has been more awareness about this disease.
Since October 2006, from the [Office of the First Lady
[es]](http://www.primeradama.gob.do/), Dr. Margarita Cedeño de Fernández has
become a chief spokesperson for the cause of breast cancer and has launched an
annual campaign called “[Today is the Best Time.
[es]](http://beta.primeradama.gob.do/campana-hoy-es-el-mejor-momento)” The
campaign calls on women to take care of their health and some of the
activities includes conferences and lectures around the country. In addition,
flyers have been distributed and mammograms have been offered.

The campaign culminated with a benefit fashion show by Venezuelan designer
Carolina Herrera, [who praised the First Lady's initiative
[es]](http://www.hoy.com.do/rostros/2009/10/22/298822/Primera-DamaCarolina-
Herrera-alabainiciativas-del-Despacho), and supported the proposal that “Today
is the best day” become the global slogan to call attention to this disease.
In her press conference, Herrera, who also is part of the international
initiative SER, which supports awareness on a global scale, made a call to
unite the various worldwide campaigns.

There are also campaigns to raise awareness about all types of cancer, one of
these is called [Caminantes por la Vida
[es]](http://www.caminantesporlavida.com) (Walkers for Life), is a walk
through the streets of the capital city Santo Domingo, which is celebrating
its 4th version. Caminantes por la Vida is an initiative started by MercaSID,
a food services and household products company, which has been raising funds
for volunteer services, hospitals, cancer prevention groups. This year the
campaign is called “Esta Va por Todos” (This is for Everyone).

These types of campaigns are important to many Dominicans whose lives are
personally affected by cancer. The blogger Principe Mestizo [has had many
loved ones affected by various forms of cancer
[es]](http://unprincipemestizo.blogspot.com/2009/10/caminantes-por-la-vida-es-
algo-mas.html), and values campaigns that will raise awareness:

> Mi tío Juan, prominente abogado de aproximadamente 32 años , cayo victima de
> un cáncer en el área del estomago que se expandió a varios órganos y que

My Uncle Juan, a prominent 32-year-old lawyer, fell victim to stomach cancer,
which spread to various organs and finally caused him to leave this earth,
leaving me with many lessons, valuing and admiring my family because during a
crisis of this magnitude they became united as one in order to help their
youngest sibling, who was like a son to my father.

Years later, another of my father's brothers (Uncle Chichi) also became
diagnosed with cancer and once again, this time as a grown-up, I saw another
face of this disease.

What must be clear is that when one person in the family has cancer, the
entire family, by default, has cancer.
