Japan may be known for the longevity of its people, but the TV programs have a
rich and long history as its population. There are some series that have been
on air for more than half a century. What's interesting is its variety:
everything from talk shows, news, and sports to shows on cooking, music, anime
and even a program about the Imperial Family. This article takes a look at
Japanese _Choju Bangumi_ (長寿番組), which literally means “long living program”.
Definitions for Choju programs range from as young as 10 years or as old as
50.
