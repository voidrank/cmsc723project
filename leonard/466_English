Nawaat's YouTube channel – a source of videos for what's happening in Tunisia

Video-sharing portal _YouTube_ has been blocked in Tunisia since 2007 – but
that is not stopping Tunisians from sharing the horrors they are facing on the
streets with the rest of the world. As the Tunisian uprising gets into its
fourth week, more and more videos are being posted and circulated by
cyberactivists who want to world to witness what is happening to them at the
hands of the authorities.

Tunisian blog [Nawaat](http://nawaat.org/portail/) has a
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/nawaat) channel dedicated to streaming videos
of clashes and incidents as they happen on the ground, showing scenes of
horror, the tears and screams of mothers whose sons were killed and protesters
being attacked by tear gas and fired at using live ammunition, as well as
scenes from protests and funerals.
