On the eve of Sudan's [2010 presidential
elections](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/sudan-
elections-2010/), I
[interviewed](https://transparency.globalvoicesonline.org/project/sudan-vote-
monitor) Fareed Zein, who heads the citizen election monitoring project [Sudan
Vote Monitor](http://sudanvotemonitor.com), for the [Technology for
Transparency Project](https://transparency.globalvoicesonline.org). Zein was
hopeful that the project would bring greater transparency to the country's
[first democratic elections](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/12/sudan-
sudan-votes-after-24-years/) in more than two decades. “There was basically no
idea what was going on on the ground” during previous political events, Zein
said at the time. “What we're hoping to do is shine a light and give people
access to events that are occurring at remote election centers.” On Wednesday
I checked in with Zein to get his thoughts on the project now that the
elections have ended.
