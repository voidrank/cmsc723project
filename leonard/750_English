As the world watched the events that happened on board the Turkish-led [“Gaza
Freedom Flotilla”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/israel-
flotilla-raid-2010/) it was also witnessing the deterioration of political
relations between the governments of Turkey and Israel. Anger at the Israeli
government is palpable in Turkey, and [returning activists are being greeted
by officials](http://twitter.com/istanbulblogger/status/15286291234) among
hero fan-fare. As we evaluate the repercussions of these events within Turkey,
the question must be asked: Can Turkish-Israeli relations be rebuilt?

**An Extension of Turkish Foreign Policy**

writes _[James in Turkey](http://jamesinturkey.blogspot.com/2010/05/this-is-
crisis-and-it-could-get-more.html)_. Turkish public sentiment and support of
the people of Gaza currently runs high as noted in this
[tweet](http://twitter.com/fgeerdink/status/15263111430) from freelance
journalist [Fredericke Geerdink](http://twitter.com/fgeerdink):

It is important to note that the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was not sponsored by
the Turkish Government, but the attack of the flotilla has now become an issue
of national importance. _[Istanbul
Calling](http://istanbulcalling.blogspot.com/2010/06/lost-at-sea-pt-ii.html)_
explains this relation between the citizen-led flotilla and its effect on
Turkish foreign policy:

> Clearly, this rupture between Turkey and Israel has been long coming. As
> I've written before, Turkey has, for the last few years, pegged its
> relations with Israel to what happens on the Palestinian front (or, more
> specifically, on the Gaza front). Although technically not a bilateral issue
> between the two countries, the situation in Gaza has, in many ways, become
> the issue that defines the current relations between Israel and Turkey. In
> that sense, although the Gaza aid flotilla was organized by a Turkish NGO
> (the Islamist IHH) and was not sponsored by the Turkish government, it acted
> as a proxy for Turkish policy.

In fact a variety of Turkish bloggers and tweeters have asked the [Turkish
government to physically
intervene](http://istanbulian.blogspot.com/2010/05/israels-gamble-with-human-
life.html) by sending in the Turkish navy to protect the flotilla, such as in
this tweet by _[Talk
Turkey](http://twitter.com/talkturkey/status/15189027276)_ :

> Why not Turkey send the Turkish Navy to protect the remaining ships
> traveling toward Gaza right now…

**Questioning of Intentions**

There have been significant reactions to the perceived lack of justification
for Israeli aggression towards the flotilla. According to the
_[Istanbullian](http://istanbulian.blogspot.com/2010/05/israels-gamble-with-
human-life.html)_ :

> There was no justification for the use of firearms against them. Especially
> on international waters… Facing knives and slingshots don't justify shooting
> on civilians, killing even sleeping people. Israeli forces should have
> waited until those ships are in Gaza waters. Then they should have forced
> the ships to reroute without boarding them. What Israel has done is
> definitely against international law and Turkey can easily win a case in
> international courts.

_[Idilx](http://twitter.com/idilx/status/15113184233)_ notes the following on
_Twitter_ :

> Well then I guess #Israel set a precedent here. We are now allowed to shoot
> onto anything that we believe is smuggling arms. #flotilla

She [adds](http://twitter.com/idilx/status/15113249679):

> Oooo an icecream van.. BANG BANG. Oooo a 4 year old with a bulge in his
> pants.. HE MUST HAVE A GUN.. bang! Idjits. #Gaza #Flotilla #Israil

Some Twitterers have questioned the reactions (and possible future reactions)
from the Turkish government to the flotilla incident, from _[Talk
Turkey](http://twitter.com/talkturkey/status/15156275565)_ :

> Turkey to declare war against Israel? … Not far fetched … All of this is
> part of a bigger ‘script’

And this one from
_[fgeerdink](http://twitter.com/fgeerdink/status/15234009468)_ :

> turkish friend: ‘erdogan just orchestred this whole #flotilla thing to
> increase his popularity again’ he's serious #conspiracytheory #turkey

In any case, the deterioration of relations also raises questions of safety,
from _[Idilx](http://twitter.com/idilx/status/15111538419)_ :

> Is #Turkey becoming a dangerous place for Jewish Turks? It seems that
> racists are everywhere and their idiocy is endless. So easily fueled.

Time will only tell what will happen between Turkey and Israel. The last word
in this post goes to the blogger and columnist _[The White
Path](http://www.thewhitepath.com/archives/2010/06/who_the_hell_does_israel_think_she_is.php)_
as he describes the differences in Turkish philosophy and Israeli philosophy:

> When I asked that question to an Israeli hawk some years ago, I received a
> very revealing response: “Might,” he said, “makes right.” Well, that might
> be a popular belief in Tel Aviv and Occupied Jerusalem, but not here in
> Istanbul. In fact our creed tells us that the exact opposite is true: Right,
> sooner or later, makes might.  
>  The hundreds of heroes who sailed to Gaza last weekend had this faith in
> their hearts. Here in Turkey, 70 million more stand by them. We mourn for
> our fallen, but also know that they did not die in vain. Their sacrifice
> unveiled to the world not just the suffering of the innocents in the Gaza
> ghetto, but also the brutality of the rogue state that imposes it.  
>  Read my lips: This spirit is really not going to die. We Turks will
> continue to stand for what is right, regardless of Israel's might. None of
