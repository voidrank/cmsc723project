Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana will be the two nations representing the West African
region at the World Cup 2010 in South Africa. For the first time, the World
Cup will be hosted on African soil and therefore will provide tremendous
incentives for African nations to excel on the brightest of stages.

For better or for worse, the World Cup has indeed become one of the most
anticipated global events and the epitome of an increasingly globally
connected world.

At the World Cup, football players wear their patriotism on their sleeve and
sometimes, for famed photographer Annie Leibowitz, [on their
underwear](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/05/world-cup-cover-
story.html).

Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana's two brightest stars, Dider Drogba and Michael Essien
(featured in the aforementioned photo spread) are teamates for Chelsea
Football Club in the English Premier League. The two stars have also [joined
forces in the past in producing a rap
single](http://www.modernghana.com/music/5512/3/chelsea-stars-record-anti-
racism-single8230essien-.html) against racism and are often seen celebrating
together with [humorous dance
moves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ8mujNHUvc). The obvious affinity
between the two players is not always reflected in the [relations between the
two
countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d'Ivoire_%E2%80%93_Ghana_relations)
that had seen some ups and downs throughout history and the relations are
again being tested lately because of a disagreement over ownership of offshore
oil fields.

**A complex neighborly relationship**

Blogger _Nana Akyea Mensah_ explains that the two countries need to [clear out
some of the border dispute](http://theodikro.blogspot.com/2010/05/ghana-and-
la-cote-divoire-shame-okoampa.html) that were raised over the offshore oil
region:

> We need a clear border agreement, which we still do not have. As a South
> African friend of mine once said: “Trust is good, but control is necessary!”
> [..] I want to see all this political goodwill expressed clearly and
> transparently in a deal within these three months! Whilst all well-meaning
> Ivorians and Ghanaians must join in this spirit of camaraderie we must all
> insist on concrete issues

_Ivoirediaspo_ blog also highlights that [the tension between Ghana and Côte
d'Ivoire](http://www.ivoirediaspo.net/index.php/economie-ivoirienne/tensions-
entre-la-cote-divoire-et-le-ghana-sur-fond-de-rivalite-petroliere/) is mostly
over offshore oil (fr):

> Pourquoi la Côte d’Ivoire n’aurait-elle pas sa part de gâteau pétrolier? Et
> tant pis si ça perturbe momentanément les relations de bon voisinage avec le
> Ghana [..] Problème : la frontière maritime entre les deux voisins n’a
> jamais été formellement établie, même si ceux-ci respectent depuis les
> indépendances une « ligne médiane »

Why wouldn't Côte d’Ivoire not have its share of the oil treasure trove? Too
bad if it perturbs temporarily the nice neighborliness with Ghana [..] The
issue: the sea border between the two neighbors has never been formally
established, even though both countries have respected since independence the
“median line”.

**An epic final match at the 1992 African Cup of Nations**

The rivalry on the pitch is also growing in intensity. The apex of the grudge
was probably reached at a memorable African Cup final in 1992 when the final
verdict in favor of the Ivorians came after a historical 11-10 penalty shot-
out:  

**Solidarity with Togo during the 2010 African Cup of Nations tragedy.**

The strong ties between the two teams and neighbor Togo were on display at the
African Cup of Nations in 2010 in Angola when [both teams considered
withdrawing from the
competition](http://sports.peacefmonline.com/soccer/201001/36553.php) after
the [Togolese team bus came under fire in
Cabinda](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2010/01/11/what-happens-in-
cabinda-doesnt-stay-in-cabinda/). They eventually carried on after the
Togolese team, [who were eventually disqualified in a controversial
decision](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/12/togo-disqualified-from-
african-cup-following-deadly-attack/), asked them to keep on playing.

Togo has now been reinserted in the African Cup of Nations. _Ghanasoccernet_
points out that [Ghana deserve some
credits](http://ghanasoccernet.com/2010/05/togo-to-be-reinstated-in-the-
africa-cup-of-nations/) for this development:

> This is a resounding victory for Ghana president John Evans Atta Mills and
> his deputy John Mahama who had had confronted Hayatou over the issue two
> months ago.

**Socially Conscious Players**

The reality that football is sometimes “much more than football”, especially
for the African Continent, is not lost on the Ivorian and Ghanaian players.
Players from both teams have used their unique positions of public figures to
advance important social issues. beside the aforementioned song against
racism, players can be seen in these videos using social media platforms to
increase awareness against Malaria and lack of education:

  
_Côte d'Ivoire Players vs No Education_

_Ghanaian players vs Malaria_

The expectation will be sky-high for both countries back home as
representatives of the West African Region. If they both can advance far
enough to face each other in the knock-out round, we might have the making of
another formidable football drama, just like in the 1992 match.
