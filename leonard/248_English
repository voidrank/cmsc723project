While Bolivia was reported to be the world’s third largest producer of coca by
the UN 2010 World Drug report, US agents working for the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) will not be returning there anytime soon. __[_The Latin

The president of Bolivia, [Evo
Morales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales), was a militant coca grower
prior to his Presidency and passionately defends coca growing and chewing.

Coca chewing acts as a mild stimulant and has largely been used to treat
altitude sickness. Using the coca leaf for chewing or brewing tea has been [a
traditional indigenous
practice](http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&id=262:coca-
leaf-myths-and-reality&Itemid=99) in the Andes region. A
[study](http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&id=266:the-
who-cocaine-project&Itemid=99) (publication of this study was banned, but is
partially available on the Transnational Institute’s website) in 1995 by the
World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that no negative effects appear
through the use of coca leaves; rather, the indigenous Andean population
experienced positive effects in their therapeutic, sacred, and social
functions. [_Blogging by boz_

After a questionable, brief stint by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry
on the Coca Leaf in Bolivia and Peru (1949), the 1961 UN Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs ordered the elimination of chewing coca leaves within 25 years
of the treaty going into effect. Bolivia has again resurfaced as a proponent
to eliminate this UN ban.

The US moved to block Bolivia’s request, further citing that an amendment to
the article shows Bolivia’s lack of cooperation in the fight against the drug
trade. Bolivians held demonstrations, ‘chew-ins’ (see a slideshow of the chew-
ins [by the Andean Information Netowork](http://ain-bolivia.org/2011/01/coca-
chew-in-in-cochabamba-slideshow-and-commentary-from-bolivia/)), in support of
their government’s push for an amendment. __[_Hemispheric Brief_

The concerns are what would reduce the amount of illegal drugs entering the
US, and if the elimination of coca chewing would play a strong role in this.
US officials are encouraging Mexico to look at a US sponsored ‘Plan Colombia’
as a model in the drug war, despite critics of the policy calling it a
[failure](http://www.ips-

The strategy of breaking up larger cartels in order to disrupt their
operations results in the immediate filling of the gap by smaller groups which
are harder to track, monitor, and infiltrate. The case was observed to be true
in Bolivia. Stephen N. DeWitt in [_A Franciscan

The move by the US to block the amendment has some skeptics –[ _Blogging by

The allowance of coca chewing is a matter of being culturally sensitive and
supportive of the rights of indigenous people. Still, further issues such as
policies to combat drug trafficking are connected with this practice. While
the US and Bolivia are standing on opposite sides here, a consideration of
both pleas could be the way to arrive at a more acceptable compromise.
