Pro-independence rally on Via Laietana (Barcelona) on September 11, 2012. By

On November 25, 2012 [Catalans](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
europe-20345071) headed to the polls for a [snap regional
election](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/world/europe/divisive-election-in-
spains-catalonia-gives-win-to-separatist-parties.html). The polls were staged
just two months after a massive pro-independence
[rally](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/24/spain-catalans-continue-to-
push-for-independence/) took place in Barcelona. Voter turnout peaked at
almost 70%, the highest in 30 years, and the four political parties committed
to holding a referendum on self-determination (CiU-ERC-ICV-CUP) got more than
twice as many seats as those defending the status quo (PSC-PP-C). Crucially,
both of Catalonia’s major parties – the governing center-right CiU and
socialist PSC – suffered severe setbacks.

Accordingly, it appears that Catalonia is now set to hold a referendum on its
ties to the rest of Spain, and that it does not trust its major political
parties to steer the process. Spain, however, will not make it easy for the
Catalans to vote, as any attempt to divide Spain can be considered illegal
under the country's constitution, written in 1978 after the fall of Francisco
Franco's [dictatorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_dictatorship).

Cultural differences aside, many Catalans feel attracted to independence
because it would provide opportunities to build a new state that is more
efficient, democratic, transparent, and innovative. An independent Catalonia
could be very different from today’s Spain where economic crisis, opacity and
patronage politics are often denounced to be commonplace.

But could an independent Catalonia lead to the break-up of the establishment
dynamics that have dominated Spain since the late-1970s? The optimists believe
so. For instance, the economic viability of an independent Catalonia has been
widely [discussed](http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/sala-de-
premsa/actualitat/entrevistes/2011/enrico_spolaore.html), and is considered
possible so long as there are few trade barriers. But viability is not only
about having enough resources. Economist [Jordi
Galí](http://www.crei.cat/people/gali/) writes in a Catalan newspaper op-ed
translated by the [Wilson Initiative](http://wilson.cat/en/mitjans-
escrits/articles-dels-membres/item/173-la-independ%C3%A8ncia-per-fer-
qu%C3%A8?.html):

But how productive a society based on patronage politics can be? Taking
inspiration from the book [Why Nations Fail](http://whynationsfail.com) by
Acemoglu and Robinson, [Adrià Alsina](https://twitter.com/AdriaAlsina) writes
on [e-notícies](http://opinio.e-noticies.cat/la-punteta/per-que-catalunya-pot-
triomfar-i-69300.html) [ca] on the need to change Catalonia’s power
structures:

> The extractive elites control public power and the big service companies,
> and form a caste that takes up the country's wealth just as parasitics do
> with hosts. They disguise it as national interest, public service or local
> industry protection, but it is always the same protection of the privileges
> of a minority over the interest of the majority.

In a follow-up [article](http://opinio.e-noticies.cat/la-punteta/per-que-
catalunya-pot-triomfar-ii-69704.html) [ca], he adds:

Some doubt this structural change is possible with the major centre-right wing
party CiU leading the process.

For example, the [blog](http://ciuensroba.wordpress.com/) and Twitter account
[@CiUensRoba](https://twitter.com/CIUensroba) (‘CiU is Robbing Us’), with
6,810 followers, says on its Twitter profile description:

> Catalunya es mereix una independència sense lladres. CiU ens ha robat
> llibertats, sobirania, identitat, benestar… i ho continuarà fent!

> Catalonia deserves an independence without thieves. CiU has stolen our
> freedoms, sovereignty, identity, welfare… and will keep doing it!

Others point out that ending corruption generally is far more urgent than
independence from Spain.

> [@Moragasanti](https://twitter.com/Moragasanti/status/273690057133674496):
> Al Oasi catala no hi han Datils (pel poble, clar) Volem la Independencia,

An independence process would shake the political and economic order of the
region. However, it will take much more than a referendum to shake social and
power dynamics. Could it be a first step?
