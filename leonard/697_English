On June 21, in a must-win match against Honduras in the 2010 World Cup,
Spanish defender [Gerard Pique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Pique) was
a picture of patriotic mettle. A dive for a header had bloodied his lip. An
opponent’s pass, intercepted too low for comfort, gave Pique's gait a tender
hitch. A cotton bandage flapped loose over his temple: in an earlier match, a
rival’s boot had smacked him upside the head. By the end of the match, Pique
looked horrible, but appropriately so: every inch the young hero, leaving his
skin on the field for his country.

The only question was: which country?

In [Catalonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia), the northeast region
where Pique is from, a desire for a Catalan “national” team has provoked
ambivalence with Spain's favored team. Much of it is gathering at a Facebook
page, which one can characterize as dedicated to Catalan's pride in their
impressive soccer tradition, or whining over their lack of recognition,
depending on your point of view:

Commenter NaniBcn, [writing in Catalan,
says](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=396044266761&id=175712041761):

> Preparem-nos per la españolada que se'ns ve a sobre amb la roja. Ni que
> juguessin 11 catalans, mai aniria amb una seleccion en nom d'un altre país.

Get prepared for the _españolada_ [a huge spanish exaltation] that is looming
with “la roja”. Even if there were 11 Catalan players in the team, I would
never support a team in another country's name.

Amid the flag waving of a World Cup, a person from Barcelona calling Spain
“another country's name” can seem strange. The [Catalan Fútbol
Association](http://www.fcf.cat/pub/home.asp) has argued that precedents
exist: Wayne Rooney plays for England, under the St. George's Cross flag, not
for the United Kingdom, or a Union Jack. Among Spain's victim’s on the way to
qualifying for this month’s finals was a team from the little-known Faroe
Islands — officially not an independent nation, a part of Denmark, but
competing independently.

Complicating matters, this year's Spanish team, current champions of Europe,
count as many as half its starting players as Catalans. If Catalonia had it’s
own team, not just Pique, but several more of the world’s best players would
wear its shirt, and the tiny province of eight million would have a fair shot
at taking on giants like Brazil, Germany, and, controversially, Spain itself.
In a friendly match last year, the Catalan team [beat
Argentina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_CqdX9qxFc), currently undefeated
in South Africa, 4-2. The previous year they'd beaten Colombia, a former World
Cup finals participant.

The tantalizing possibilities have provoked, for some at least, frustration.
At the [pro-Catalan Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Seleccions-
Catalanes/175712041761), supporter José Antonio Castells refers, with a
humorous touch, to “our players” getting hurt playing for a foreign country –
Spain.

> Per a que volem selecció espanyola? Per a que se'ns lesionin els jugadors?

Why do we want a Spanish national team? To get our players hurt?

It's far from a universal feeling. Also via Facebook, [a group of pro-Roja
fans ](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=120873461282772&ref=ts)in
Catalonia is calling for the city government in Catalonia's capital,
Barcelona, to mount a giant screen in the city's largest plaza to view the
matches. The Mayor's office, moving with notable indifference, authorized the
groups calling for the screens to use the plaza, but told them to[ do it
themselves

quiere-instalar-una-pantalla-en-la-plaza-sant-jaume-para-seguir-a-la-
seleccion-espanola.html).

Inevitably, those emotions have helped regional sports politics bleed, like
Pique's split lip, into regular politics. Online, a Catalan body, the
[National Team Platform](http://www.seleccions.cat/) **,** has already
established Catalan teams in twenty sports, including rugby and indoor soccer,
and argued that international sports federations, rather than local
governments, should decide which teams are allowed to compete. Soccer’s
governing body, FIFA, which hosts the World Cup, disagrees. FIFA maintains a
policy of granting entrance only to independent nations recognized by the
United Nations. But the reasoning is often hard to follow, and inconsistent,
argues

The sentiment is common enough in Catalonia that an online effort, [Plataforma
Pro](http://www.seleccions.cat/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=1&Itemid=36&lang=ca),
has attempted, with limited success, to raise the issue. The group has
recruited [Catalonia’s former
President](http://www.seleccions.cat/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11732%3Amaragall-
reclama-catalunya-al-mundial-brasil-2014&catid=1%3Anoticies&Itemid=36&lang=ca)
and the [incoming President of Barcelona’s professional soccer
team](https://goal.com/en/news/article?contentId=1967711) to support it’s
cause.

Much of the discussion has occurred offline, in bars and plazas. In l'Espluga
de Francoli, an olive farming town two hours from Barcelona, you could hear
firecrackers following the two goals that the national team scored during the
match against Honduras, and at the end of the match, to celebrate the victory.
But the celebrations came from the local Real Madrid supporters’ club, which
supports Madrid's team in the Spanish League. The club for Barcelona's
supporters, didn't carry out any special event, although many of Barcelona's
players had been on the field for the national team's win.

At the Facebook group, Catalonia support Daniel Llopis said that he thinks
Spain is going to win the whole tournament, and tried to manage his dismay:

> Les coses com són, qui té més probabilitats de guanyar el mundial és la
> selecció de l'estat espanyol (ja m'agradaria que perdés tots els partits
> fins que no reconeguin la selecció catalana).

Things being what they are, who has the best chance of winning the world cup
is the national team of the Spanish country (I would like them to lose all the
matches until a Catalan national team is recognized).

I l'Espluga de Francoli, an older gentleman, who declined to give his name,
was somewhat more curt:

“De ponent, ni gent ni vent,” he told GV. “From the West, neither people nor
wind.”

Madrid is to Catalonia's west.
