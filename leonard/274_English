Indonesia’s plan to build its first [nuclear
plant](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/24/indonesia%E2%80%99s-future-
welfare-and-nuclear-risks.html) in the next decade has been shelved
indefinitely because of the [nuclear disaster
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/)in Japan. Indonesia has large uranium deposits but like Japan,
it’s located inside the ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’ where the threat of earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions is high. Bloggers are joining the debate on whether
Indonesia should pursue its nuclear dreams.

Erwin Wirawan is
[neutral](http://imo.thejakartapost.com/erwin/2011/03/23/indonesia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-
power-plant-to-be-or-not-to-be/) on the issue

Colson hopes that Indonesian authorities would seriously [consider the
situation](http://www.pelopor.nl/2011/fukushima-and-banka-belitung/) in
Fukushima, Japan before building a nuclear plant

Calvin supports the idea of using nuclear energy but insists that the plant
must be located in a [safe area](http://www.pelopor.nl/2011/fukushima-and-

Tikno suggests [other sources of energy](http://www.pelopor.nl/2011/fukushima-
and-banka-belitung/#comment-25067) like coal or geothermal

_Multibrand_ emphasizes the need to include nuclear energy as an
[option](http://www.multibrand.biz/2011/03/nuclear-reactors-in-

to meet the future energy requirement of Indonesia

Luke believes that despite the crisis in Japan, nuclear energy [should not be
dismissed](http://www.multibrand.biz/2011/03/nuclear-reactors-in-

identifies ‘safe’ areas in Indonesia which are outside the ‘ring of fire.’
