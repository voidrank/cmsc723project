It appears that not only the flu virus is getting the Moroccan authorities
unnerved. Another virus has been upsetting them: Freedom of Expression.

At least five Moroccan independent journalists will appear before a judge
later this month in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, after having published
articles in their newspapers, _Al-Jarida al-Oula_ , _Al-Ayam_ and _Al-Mishaal_
, in which they challenged the official announcement about King Mohammed VI's
health. It all started when on August 26, the Royal Palace, in an
unprecedented move, revealed that the monarch has contracted “a viral, benign
disease” and needed convalescing for five days. The next day, the Moroccan
press started commenting on the announcement, mostly praising the transparency
of the palace, some (citing anonymous sources) associating the king's illness
with the hypothetic “abuse of immunodepressants to treat asthma.” Bloggers
soon joined the debate. After a while, a wave of rumors and gossip emerged,
giving way to speculations and all kinds of interpretations. Then authorities
started calling in and [arresting ](http://cpj.org/2009/09/in-morocco-
journalists-interrogated-over-article-o.php)journalists who were submitted to
long hours of questioning on the sources of their information, with some
interrogations lasting for more than 40 hours.

Most bloggers denounced the attacks on journalists which, according to the[
official news
agency](http://www.map.ma/fr/sections/general/ali_anouzla_et_bouch/view) [Fr],
were based on the Press Code used by the prosecutor to accuse journalists of
“publication offense,” “libel,” “bad intentions” and of spreading “false
information” and “untruthful facts.”

_Solidarité Maroc_ , a citizen online platform campaigning for human rights in
Morocco, [publishes a letter](http://solidmar.blogspot.com/2009/09/40-heures-

activist [Khalid Jamai](http://www.khalidjamai.com/) [Fr], who writes:

They have weapons, police stations, executioners, but we have words. Words
that history implanted into the memory of the future. It must be said that
we're back in the era of “Amoul Nooba” (“Who's Next”). Dozens of dailies and
weeklies had to suffer the horrors of censorship, bans, lawsuits, fines that
are unique in the history of the press. Tomorrow, who's next?  
Yet: at the beginning was the word. The word that can not be put behind bars
or be assassinated.

_[A Moroccan about the world around
him](http://cabalamuse.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/morocco-in-dire-need-of-
journalistic-maturity/)_ blames the journalists and calls for more
“journalistic maturity.” He writes:

> Morocco’s craven and politically naïve diplomats in addressing the Western

It is not the first time this year that journalists have found themselves in
the dock. Unlike previous affairs, _Bluesman_[notices
](http://jomfery.blogspot.com/2009/09/blog-post.html)[Ar], this time around
the accused may find themselves abandoned:

> هذه القضية تختلف عن باقي القضايا والسبب أن الصحافيين المتابعين وجدوا أنفسهم
> بمفردهم في ساحة المعركة بعد ان تخلى عنهم زملاءهم الصحافيين في سابقة خطيرة
> تؤكد شيئا واحدا ان المخزن نجح في شيئين  
>  الاول تخويف الجسم الصحفي  
>  والثاني زرع الشقاق بين الصحفيين

It is different this time because indicted journalists found themselves alone
in the battlefield, abandoned by their colleagues in a dangerous precedent
that confirms that the government has succeeded in two things: intimidating
the press and sowing dissension among journalists.

The debate over the issue took at times some unexpected turns. Kissing the
hand of the monarch in Morocco is a centuries old custom which, although not
compulsory, most Moroccans feel compelled to perform in order to show their
allegiance to the king. _Larbi_ , citing an editorial by journalist Rachid
Nini who suggested the banning of the practice for prophylactic reasons,
[deplores ](http://www.larbi.org/post/2009/08/Chef-d’œuvre-surréaliste)[Fr]
the fact that the custom was not being disfavored for the good reasons. He
writes:

> Ainsi donc il faut abolir le baise-main non pas parce qu’il représente une
> pratique venue d’un autre temps, non pas parce qu’il est humiliant pour la
> dignité humaine, non pas parce qu’il représente un étonnant contraste avec
> le Maroc moderne chanté à tout bout de champs. Non il faut l’abolir pour
> protéger le roi contre la saleté et les microbes que portent, forcément, ses
> sujets, leurs mains et leurs bouches.

So we must abolish hand-kissing, not because it represents a practice coming
from another time, not because it is humiliating for human dignity, not
because it represents an astonishing contrast with the modern Morocco sung at
every turn. No, we're told it should be abolished in order to protect the king
against dirt and germs carried, inevitably, by his subjects, their hands and
mouths.

For an outsider, it is difficult to comprehend the Moroccan authorities’
repeated attitude towards the media unless it is put in the context of the
Moroccan system of governance which places the king above the rest of the
mortals. _Jillian York_ , blogger, activist and fine connoisseur of Morocco,

journalists have published so nasty as to prompt such reaction from the
authorities. She writes:
