The Egyptian Twittersphere on
[#jan25](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23jan25) is thick with stories of the
ongoing unrest. For observers, the rooftops have become a favored vantage. In
Suez, Ian Lee @ianinegypt [captures](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23jan25)
the feeling:

> I'm shooting video from rooftops, too dangerous for foreigners on street.
> Numbers in thousands. [#jan25](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23jan25
> "#jan25") [#suez](http://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23suez "#suez")

A lot of Twitter coverage on [#jan25](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23jan25)
is in English, suggesting that it is being used for amplification and
international news purposes, rather than for organizational purposes on the
ground. Metaphorically as well, social media present a rooftop vantage.

Jailan El-Rafie's tweet captures this mood. She translates, and then tweets
about her [English
version](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?created&&note_id=10150090021068548)
of a descriptive
[essay](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=498933449005&id=521785242) by
a filmmaker, [Amr Salama](http://www.amrsalama.com/).

Salama's story is itself a media event; both a graphic account the beating he
took by police, and a self-observed and reported view of himself as
demonstrator. He begins his story by identifying himself as playing a role:

> The street was totally vacant of people, and in the horizon I could see a
> mass of people. At first I thought they were protesters but then I noticed
> that they all were dressed in black, coming in our direction and holding
> black sticks. I remembered the scenes from old war movies, like Braveheart
> and Gladiator, and I had the exact feeling of old battle grounds, and I
> found myself one of the first people to run towards the approaching lines of
> police.

Salama's story quickly turns grim. He changes roles, from action hero to war
reporter to victim:

> I had my dear iPhone in hand, and I was trying to take photos or record
> videos, until I got surrounded by a large enough amount of soldiers who
> started beating me ferociously with their sticks, delivering painful blows
> on my head, face, stomach and legs.

As the beating continues, Salama is dragged off the street and beaten multiple
times:

> Then we entered a building, the nice soldiers escorting, he locked the
> entrance, tripped my legs and got me on the ground, then started the painful
> episode of vicious beating.

He reports that he begins to imagine himself as a social media martyr:

> Visions about my family, how this was going to affect them, about the movie
> that I hadn’t finished directing yet, about the page that would be created
> about me on Facebook, and I wondered if it would have the title “We all are
> Amr Salama”. I also thought about the statement the Ministry of Interior
> would issue, saying that I must have died after accidently swallowing my
> iPhone.

Saved by some of the soldiers, he is able to escape. He then pinpoints his
motives:

> I discovered that the most important thing is that I realized these things,
> that I know why I was beaten, why I protested, and that I know that without
> signs and complex political demands I understood why I endured all this. I
> endured all this because I want a better Egypt, a better Egypt without
> absolute ongoing power to anyone of its governors, and a better Egypt
> without a large gap in social structure.

MFMAegy's video, shot from the rooftoops, may be the greatest echo of famous
protest imagery. This video from January 25
[shows](http://www.youtube.com/user/MFMAegy#p/a/u/0/kWr6MypZ-JU) Egypt's
Tiananmen moment, with a [similar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man)
camera angle:
