Ecuador's new Constitution, which was passed by a national referendum in 2008,
says in Article 16 that [all people, individually or as a group, have the
right to free, intercultural, inclusive, diverse, and participative
communication [es]](http://legislaciones.item.org.uy/index?q=node/322).
However, the interpretation of this article in the form of laws has created
some controversy. Many have started to debate about the contents the new
Communication Law, which is the very first one of this kind in Ecuador. On one
side, the government seeks to regulate the media, partly in response to the
frequent clashes between journalists and the administration of President
Rafael Correa, who has been critical of the role of the media during his first
term as president. Correa [has described journalists as “corrupt, mediocre,
shameless.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8406887.stm)“

Those who are opposed to the proposed law say that the government wants to
silence critics and say that this is a danger to free speech. The draft bill
of [The Organic Law of Communication, Freedom of Expression and Access to
Public Information [pdf]
](http://documentacion.asambleanacional.gov.ec/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/c9468699-d1b6-4f87-8c50-a34cce0227f8/Ley%20Org%C3%A1nica%20de%20Comunicaci%C3%B3n,%20Libertad%20de%20Expresi%C3%B3n%20y%20Acceso%20a%20la%20Informaci%C3%B3n%20P%C3%BAblica)
is a document of 38 pages and is being presented and analyzed by different
groups in the country, including bloggers, but particularly the media.

The government released this video with examples to answer the question, “Why
do citizens need a Law of Communication?”

Blogger Silvia of _[Lunas Azules [es]](http://www.lunasazules.com/2009/11/el-
periodismo-si-necesita-control.html)_ for example, agrees with the government
and thinks that journalists do need controls. She reflects on the profession
of journalist in the country:

> En principio resulta hasta ameno constatar lo que muchas veces es ingenuidad
> de editores con poca preparación profesional y quizá ninguna experiencia en
> escribir textos, pero después termina siendo seriamente preocupante porque
> se comprende que nuestra prensa “profesional” no sólo es amateur, sino que
> muchas veces omite, agrega y selecciona intencionalmente, tendenciosamente,
> con designios que no son precisamente la entrega de información imparcial a
> los ciudadanos.

At the beginning, it ends up being entertaining to note what often is the
naivety of editors who have little professional training and maybe no
experience writing texts, but later it ends up being seriously worrisome
because it is understood that our “professional” press is not only amateur,
but often omits, adds, and selects intentionally, biased, with intentions that
are not precisely to deliver information to citizens in an impartially manner.

One of the proposals in the law is that only those individuals who have earned
journalism degrees would be able to practice the profession. Ricardo Tello of
_[Periodismo por Dentro
[es]](http://hablemosdeperiodismo.blogspot.com/2009/12/los-enemigos-de-la-
prensa.html)_ has lived and verified what Lunas Azules has commented before.
He calls on all journalists to remember that laws governing the media
themselves, do not become obstacles for the independent exercise of this
career. His opinions against practices of which he disapproves had earned the
‘enemy of journalism’ according to a radio announcer in Cuenca, an austral
city in Ecuador. Tello responds to his detractor and why a journalist does not
necessarily need to have a journalism degree:

> A pesar de ser profesor universitario, no reivindico la colegiatura o la
> obligatoriedad del título de periodista; el título solo es el primer paso de
> una formación profunda y permanente.
>
> Y si eso me vuelve un enemigo de la prensa, pues me declaro enemigo del
> periodismo mediocre.

Despite being a university professor, I make no claim of making a journalism
degree mandatory, the degree is only the first step in a profound and ongoing
training.

And if that makes me an enemy of the press, then I plead that I am an enemy of
mediocre journalism.

In Ecuador, the media is considered the fourth power, after Presidency,
Congress and the Supreme Court. However, President Correa says, “[power needs
to be regulated and controlled, we need a balance of
power,](http://www.infolatam.com/entrada/ecuador_correa_defiende_ley_de_comunicac-17625.html)”
when he speaks about media and journalists in his country. His position has
caused that many Latin American organizations including
[CIESPAL,](http://www.ciespal.net/ciespal/) that raises concerns about the
draft of communications law. Groups in opposition to the approval of this law
like to call it: Gag Law. In front of this, Galo Benítez of _[Migrante Latino
[es]](http://www.migrantelatino.com/?p=4535)_ asks his readers, “Gag law for
who?”and presents some of the 11 observations made by the CIESPAL including
the allocation of frequencies into three equal parts: public, private and
community, the banning of the concentration of frequencies, and media
monopolies, and giving priority to national and local production. However,
Benitez also criticizes some prominent figures in the Ecuadorian media,
assuming they are not the only one in need to be heard:

> Quién ha dicho que solo los encopetados comunicadores como [Carlos
> Vera](http://ecuadorconstruye.blogspot.com/2009/12/carlos-vera-el-candidato-

Who said that only conceited communicators as Carlos Vera, Bernardo Abad,
Jorge Ortiz, Marcelo Dotti, Alfonso Espinoza de los Monteros, Gissela Bayonne,
among others, can make communication in Ecuador. They are the ones who make a
fuss, not out of concern for the listener or viewer, but because they are
concerned about the extent of the law that could disturb the private companies
they represent. What irks the media elite is that there is no law that
infringes on freedom of expression as such, but to the freedom of private
businesses, which are affected by the scope of the bill which seeks to make
certain reforms to democratize in part the right to communicate.

Another of the major components of the bill would require TV channels to
progressively include at least [40% of national production in its daily
programming,](http://theamericano.com/2009/12/10/ley-de-comunicacion-cada-dia-
menos-libertad/) and radio at least 50% of music produced, composed and/or
played in Ecuador. The Latin American country has more than 1500 radio
frequencies, 97% belonging to natural and private persons. A radio
entrepreneur can accumulate up to[ 96 frequencies under the previous
Ecuadorian communication
law.](http://diarioitihue.blogspot.com/2009/12/periodismo-latinoamericano-

To professor Hoax, a commenter on _[Ecuador sin Censura
[es]](http://ecuadorsincensura.blogspot.com/2009/11/marcha-contra-la-ley-
mordaza.html?showComment=1259173367657#c7380556493949126962)_ the proposal to
which [Assemblyman from Guayas, Rolando Pachana,
](http://www.cre.com.ec/Desktop.aspx?Id=143&e=134571) has promoted and
contributed, seems to be dedicated in some way to the former TV anchor, now
politician and the leader in opposition to Correa along to former president
Gutierrez, Carlos Vera. Pachana proposal says that only community journalists
do not need certifications.

Universities also have been promoting discussions within their institutions.
One example has been in the University of Cuenca, where the [President of the
Association of Students of the School of Communication
[es]](http://www.eltiempo.com.ec/noticias-cuenca/29478-ley-de-comunicacia-n-
sin-consenso/) says that having to reveal sources as the law proposes,
journalism is being impeded to do investigation, and in a way, to apply self-
censorship. Diana Medina thinks this is a media law opposed to what they
declare:

> Siempre han existido regulaciones, pero no se las ha cumplido a cabalidad.
> Esta no es una ley de comunicación, porque sólo regula el aspecto
> informativo, no aborda la comunicación institucional, organizacional… es una
> ley de medios. Creo que la propuesta no fue bien analizada en algunos
> puntos, al tener que revelar las fuentes no podríamos desarrollar trabajos
> de investigación, eso daría paso a la autocensura y ningún periodista querrá
> aplicar una labor de esta índole.

Regulations have always existed, but they have not been fully implemented.
This is not an law of communication, because it only regulates the
informational aspect, it does not address the institutional and organizational
communication … it is a media law. I think the proposal was not well analyzed
in some places, having to disclose the sources we could not develop research,
that would lead to self-censorship and no journalist will want to implement a
work of this nature.
