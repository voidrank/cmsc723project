Rumors are swirling following a [local news report](http://www.gulf-
times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=352533&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56)
that Qatar has made plans to scrap its visa-on-arrival policy for dozens of
nations.

According to the [_Gulf Times_](http://www.gulf-
times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=352533&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56),
the change, to take effect May 1, will require nationals of 33 European,
Western and Asian countries to obtain visas before arriving in Qatar by
contacting the Qatari embassies in their home countries.

The United States, [British](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-
abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/qatar ) and French
embassies in Doha have confirmed that their nations are among those affected
by the change, but officials from other countries said they are still making
inquiries.

The news was greeted with dismay by many Doha residents on _Twitter_.

Some bloggers here said they suspected that the change was spurred on by
“reciprocity” – a tit for tat response to countries that require Qatari
nationals to apply for visas before arrival.

Others mused that it was Qatar's way of securing its borders following the
assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in January. He is [suspected
to have been
killed](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703775504575136140173621332.html)
by men holding falsified European and British passports. Dubai blames Israel's
national intelligence agency Mossad for the slaying.

On the popular online forum _Qatar Living_ , where a

generated more than 100 comments, _Bleu_ said:

Whatever the reason, most agree that the additional paperwork required to
visit Qatar and the lack of Qatari embassies in many nations are likely to
hurt the country's efforts to boost tourism.

Others said they thought the move brought fairness to the system.

Still, those living far from family and friends worry that the change will
make it even more difficult to keep in touch.
