The Arab World is looking in awe at the developments unfolding in Egypt.
Today, mainstream media is taking a back seat, while citizen media triumphs.

While new media plays an important role in shaping people's opinions, new
means of communication play an important role on the ground where they also
help in organizing the masses in protests and demonstrations. Arab bloggers
here are discussing the role of all these means in the ongoing protests in
Egypt, where thousands of people are taking to the streets to call of
political and economic reforms.

Moroccan blogger Hisham [wrote here about the role of media in the
demonstrations in Egypt](http://almiraatblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/twitter-
a-weapon-of-mass-dissemination/). He focused how the new social media tools
have been used in Egypt, like they have been used in Tunisia earlier this
month.

Today, Egyptians responded to calls for a march against the 30-year rule of
Husni Mubarak. People took to (and are still in) the streets of Cairo and main
Egyptian cities, peacefully venting their anger against three decades of
corruption and repression. Most of the protesters are young and have spent all
their lives under Mubarak’s police state and emergency rules. Facebook and
Twitter again have been instrumental in coordinating protesters’ efforts as
small groups in their hundreds congregated in the streets and public squares
of Cairo and Alexandria, to gradually form huge masses of tens of thousands
calling for change.

Hisham made a reference to the Tunisian uprising that preceded the Egyptian
one, and shed more light on the role of Twitter and Facebook there.

The role of the internet and social media in emboldening the Tunisian uprising
that led to the first ever popular Arab revolution to topple an Arab dictator,
was pivotal. I’m not saying it was a Twitter Revolution, I’m saying Twitter
and social media were an effective weapon of mass dissemination. They were the
catalyst that helped the movement reach the critical mass that swept through
the country, from Sidi Bouzid all the way to the capital Tunis, and in no
time.

In fact, social media tools aren't only used as a way for communication
between the protesters. But many traditional media outlets in the region as
well as outside the region are either ignoring the protests or giving them
minimal and inappropriate coverage.

Jordanian blogger, Osama Romoh, who hated how the traditional media all over
the region dealt with the events in Egypt, decided to help in spreading the
news [by sharing links of whatever related news he could get his hands on, on
his own blog](http://osamaa.com/egyption-revolution.php).

ما يحدث في مصر من مظاهرات تندد بالنظام الحاكم وتنتفض لسوء أحوال معيشة المصريين
هو أكبر من أن يتم تلخيصه في بضع سطور لمقال أو وجهة نظر، ولأن الجهات الإعلامية
ووسائلها تقلّل من شأن أحداث مصر في أخبارها ولا تغطي فعلاً ما يحدث هناك، قررت
أنه من واجبي أن أفعل شيئاً ولم أجد في يدي إلا أن أساهم في نشر الكلمة وأن أنشر
في هذه الصفحة روابطاً لأخبار من هنا وهناك تتعلق بمظاهرات مصر

The demonstrations taking place in Egypt against the regime there are too big
to be summarized in few lines, an article or op-ed. And since traditional
media is ignoring the events in Egypt, and is not covering what's going on
there properly, I found myself obliged to respond and help in publishing here
links for the news related to the Egyptian demonstrators from here and there
and everywhere.

The Egyptian government [also resorted to censoring the Internet in order to
disable the people from using such social media
tools](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/26/egypt-after-twitter-facebook-
now-blocked/). However, Jordanian blogger, Roba Al-Assi, was still able to get
the news from Egypt. She wrote [here how new media has changed the way she,
and many of her generation, consumes the news
now](http://andfaraway.net/blog/2011/01/26/content-consumption/).

For the second time this month, I sit on my bed with my tablet in the dark and
refresh a hashtag consistently for hours.  
Our habits of consuming media and news have changed. Of course, the fact that
traditional media is shooting itself in the foot by not covering one of the
biggest events to affect Arabs in the past 10 years seriously does not help.

She then continued.

It’s the end of the world as we know it. Not politically, that is too early to
tell. In terms of content consumption though, and I know I am not telling you
anything new, it’s just fricking amazing.

Many users on twitter called this “[the picture of the
day](http://yfrog.com/h36s1cj)“.

And finally, Youssef [wrote here about his anticipation for change in the
whole region soon](http://yosefstranger.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-
post_5856.html).

ورغم أنني من أكثر الناس تشاؤماً  
من ألأوضاع العامة في المنطقة  
وكنتُ دوما أقلهم تفاؤلاً  
إلا أنني أكاد أُجزم  
أنني أشتمُ رائحة تسونامي التغيّير  
تهبُ على المنطقة بأكملها  
أما ماهيّة التغيّير فمن الصعب التكهن به  
وإن كنتُ أُخمنُ أنها تغيّيرات جذريّة

Although I'm one of the most pessimistic people.  
I am the least optimistic when it comes to the situation in the region.  
However, I have to tell you that I can feel the wind of change.  
I feel it blowing on the whole region.  
I might not be able to identify that change, but I guess it will be a major
one.
