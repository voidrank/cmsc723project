[![Neverforget.us](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/martyrbird.png)](http://neverforget.us/)Dozens of
Iranian protesters have been killed since demonstrations against the
controversial results of the presidential election in June swept the country.
On _[Neverforget.us,](http://neverforget.us/) _a new multimedia website,
photos and short biographies of more than 70 people killed have been
published.

One of these victims was [Neda Agha Soltan
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/24/iran-neda-becomes-a-symbol-for-
the-protesters/)who died with her eyes wide open. Her death was captured on
video by bystanders and uploaded to the internet. Her last moments transcended
from citizen media to mainstream media, reaching millions of people.

Iranian citizens have continued to use the
[internet](http://www.videowired.com/watch/?id=2054294834) to immortalize
other Iranian martyrs of the protest movement (a.k.a. “Green Movement”). The
opposition [claims](http://enduringamerica.com/2009/09/08/irans-victims-
the-72-people-killed-in-post-election-conflict/) the number of murdered
demonstrators is more than 70 people. Some were [killed
](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/arrests-deaths-continue-
iran-authorities-tighten-grip-20090722)under torture after arrest, while
others were shot down in the streets.

In spite of government secrecy, names and pictures of some of the fallen have
emerged.

![toufanpour](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

_[Neverforget.us](http://neverforget.us/) _says:

> Toufanpour, Amirhossein (photo above) 1977-2009  
>  Amirhossein, a father with a seven-year-old daughter, disappeared on June
> 15. After searching Tehran hospitals for a week to no avail, his distraught
> family identified him among photos of corpses at the coroner’s office. Marks
> on his corpse included a deep gash in the head, a broken arm, and gunshot
> wounds in the arm, but the exact cause of death was unclear.

Another website, _Green Martyrs,_ also [provide ](http://greenmartyrs.com/)
[fa] information about the ‘martyrs’ (temporarily offline at time of
publication).

Here is a video to remember the martys and the suffering of their mothers:

As we are watch these photos and films, there are hundreds of Iranian
political prisoners such as [Mohammad Ali
Abtahi](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/01/iran-leading-reformist-
abthai-on-trial/), a blogger and reformist politician, who face unknown
futures in Iranian prisons.
