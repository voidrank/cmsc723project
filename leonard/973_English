Caught between calls to abstain from voting and fear of violence on election
day, [Porfirio “Pepe” Lobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porfirio_Lobo_Sosa)
from the National Party was elected President of Honduras, with Elvin Santos
from the Liberal Party in second place. The elections themselves are
controversial: indirectly they support the [ousting of former president Manuel
Zelaya in June by a military
coup](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/04/honduras-was-it-a-coup/). At
the time, Zelaya was replaced by Roberto Micheletti, then President of the
National Congress, who acted as interim until the elections of November.

Few countries have confirmed whether they will acknowledge the results of the
elections, while leftist governments have stated open rejections: for the
moment, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela have not recognized
president-elect Porfirio Lobo, [The Guardian
reports](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/30/honduras-lobo-president).

In spite of the uncertainty, as well as the difficult political and social
situation of the country, the voting process proceeded without major problems.
While the Supreme Electoral Tribune reported [a turnout of 60%
[es]](http://www.libertaddigital.com/mundo/lobo-gana-las-elecciones-en-
honduras-con-una-participacion-del-613-1276377653/), a percentage higher than
expected but still problematic for declaring a representative majority.

Opposing, strong opinions about the election can be found in the

La Gringa from [La Gringa’s
Blogicito](http://lagringasblogicito.blogspot.com/) [shared her
surprise](http://lagringasblogicito.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-ground-view-of-
honduran-elections.html) when noticed the lack of militarization at the
polling places:

> I went to three polling places on Sunday in La Ceiba (the third largest city
> in Honduras) and one in El Porvenir (a smaller town) in the department of
> Atlantida. The polling places were crowded with hardly any police or
> military in sight. I was surprised at the latter because I was worried they
> would be needed for security.

Blogger David Moran from [_El Catracho_](http://elcatracho.blogspot.com/)
[believes that high-percentage of voters represented the discontent
[es]](http://elcatracho.blogspot.com/2009/12/elecciones-2009.html) against
former president Zelaya:

> El hecho destacable de las elecciones fue la notoria participación de los
> hondureños, algo sumamente necesario para contrarrestar el boicot de Zelaya
> y sus adláteres chavistas. Lo único que hicieron con sus protestas
> callejeras y actos vandálicos fue despertar nuestra conciencia democrática y
> ponerla en su contra.

The remarkable fact of the elections was the notable participation of
Hondurans, something importantly needed to counteract Zelaya's boycott and his
chavist militants. The only thing that was achieved by their public protests
and vandalism was to awaken our democratic conscience and use it against him.

On the other side of the spectrum, the [National Front of Resistance Against
the Coup’d’Etát
[es]](http://contraelgolpedeestadohn.blogspot.com/2009/11/comunicado-
no-40_29.html) calls to reject the president-elect:

> Hacemos un llamado a los gobiernos y movimientos sociales democráticos y
> honestos en el mundo a rechazar los resultados de la farsa electoral y a
> desconocer el pretendido gobierno que se instale a partir del 27 de enero.

We call on governments and honest social-democratic movements in the world to
reject the results from the electoral farce, and to disregard the pretended
government that will be inaugurated on January 27.
