At least 23 people have died in [unrest in
Tunisia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/09/tunisia-please-tell-the-
world-kasserine-is-dying/), with violent protests occurring daily and police
employing tear gas and live ammunition to control the demonstrators who are
reacting against high unemployment, corruption, increased fuel and food prices
and lack of political freedoms. As the violence continues, so too have
responses and expressions of support in Jordan.

Many Jordanian tweeters have focused on criticism of Tunisia's President Zine
El Abidine Ben Ali.

In a televised address on January 10, Ben Ali promised Tunisians that 300,000
new jobs will be created over the next two years in the country where an
estimated 55 per cent of the population is under the age of 25, and where the
current unemployment rate stands at around 15%.

of leadership with the protests:

My dear President Bin Ali, are you completely fractured from your people and
your country? What do you think about a nice long vacation in Florida on my
account?

Others expressed solidarity with the Tunisian people, such as Mohammad
Yousef's [tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/JawazSafar/status/25165561189105664):

religious solidarity:

Others tweeted about a vigil to be held on January 13th, 2011, in front of
Tunisia's embassy in Jordan,
[entitled](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=183803301637589) “Pause of
silence for Tunisia in Jordan !”

Many Jordanians related Tunisian events to tensions in other Arab countries.

Mohammad Yousef
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/JawazSafar/status/25126681953959936) about the
events in Lebanon, writing that Hezbollah's withdrawal from the Lebanese
government also placed Lebanon on Tunisia's path to populist demonstrations:

> #Lebanon join the track: Opposition to withdraw its ministers from the gov.
> today http://bit.ly/iakhXQ #Algeria #Sidibouzid #Jordan #Tunisia

These tweets, and many others, speculate that rioting in Tunisia and Algeria
are related to Jordan's tensions, and that these demonstrations will inspire
the people of Arab countries to demand economic and political reform.
