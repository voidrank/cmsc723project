At around 12:30 am on Friday, October 23, the Gulf Oil Refinery (Caribbean
Petroleum Company-CAPECO) in Bayamón (in the metropolitan area), Puerto Rico,
exploded massively. Almost 20 tanks have exploded since then, the fire is
still burning although it has been contained, and an immense and never ending
tower of smoke is covering the sky. More than a [1,000 people who live in the
surrounding neighborhoods have been
relocated](http://www.elnuevodia.com/nocedenlasllamas-629711.html), and five
municipalities have been declared in state of emergency.
[Activists](http://www.prensacomunitaria.com/gente/791-lideres-comunitarios-
reaccionan-valerosos-a-explosion-de-tanques-de-combustible.html) and
[scientists have warned about the devastating ecological
consequences](http://www.primerahora.com/diario/noticia/otras/noticias/serios_y_potenciales_danos_al_ambiente,_segun_experto/339941)
of this disaster, and how it will affect people's health. [Community leaders
of the surrounding neighborhoods](http://www.dialogodigital.com/) have been
warning the government for years about the environmental and health
implications of living close to an oil refinery.

[The causes of the
explosion](http://www.vocero.com/noticia-33404-incierto_origen_del_siniestro.html)
are still under investigation.

In [_Haciendo punto en otro blog_](http://carmeloruiz.blogspot.com/) [ES],
journalist and blogger Carmel Ruiz comments:

> On Thursday night the Gulf Oil refinery in the nearby town of Cataño blew
> up. The blast and shock waves were felt twenty miles away. It was a sound
> like nothing I had ever heard in my life (the shock wave actually opened my
> bedroom door). In the four or five seconds after the explosion, the fireball
> was as bright as the three o'clock sun The fire is still burning, the plume
> of smoke is like nothing ever seen in Puerto Rico.

Historian and blogger Ivone Acosta was also affected by the blast, as she
expresses in _[Sin mordazas](http://desahogoboricua.blogspot.com/) _[ES]:

No me atrevo salir. Ya dos amigas que conocen mis alergias me llamaron para
advertirme eso mismo, que no salga porque el aire contiene demasiados
particulados peligrosos y que cierre todas las ventanas. Como quiera, no me
interesa ver la histeria de la gente que por menos que eso se paniquean. Ya he
visto comentarios en el periódico en línea acusando a “los socialistas de
siempre”.

> I dare not venture out. Already two friends who know about my allergies have
> called me to warn me that I should not leave the house because the air has
> too many dangerous particulates. They said I should close the windows.
> Anyway, I am not in the least interested in seeing people in hysteria who
> enter in panic with even less important things. I have already seen comments
> in the newspapers accusing the “same old socialists” of the explosion.

To understand Acosta's comments, some context is necessary. Just as recently
as last October 15 there was a [national strike in Puerto
Rico](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/16/puerto-rico-reflections-on-
the-national-strike/). Government officials have accused demonstrators of
being terrorists.

In _[Observations from the “Island of
Enchantment”](http://encantada2006.blogspot.com/)_ , blogger Adriana remembers
how she felt when she heard the explosion:

> Yesterday, when I woke up, I heard the distant sounds of helicopters flying.
> I though to myself, well, maybe something's going on in the housing projects
> ([caseríos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing_in_Puerto_Rico)). A
> short while later, I found out about the explosion. Although it had occurred
> in [Cataño](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cata%C3%B1o,_Puerto_Rico), which is
> just outside of San Juan, I saw the black clouds from my house. The
> magnitude of the explosion registered a 2.8 on the richter scale. Thousands
> of people had to be evacuated. Law enforcement officials are currently
> investigating the causes of the explosion. I can't imagine what the
> environmental, health and economic consequences will amount to. Luckily, no
> deaths have been reported.
