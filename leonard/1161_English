Helmsley Hotel has
[canceled](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jad_gets_heave_ho_from_helmsley_nIJbRjyo9FqI7FhHe5SM3O)
a banquet next week after discovering that Ahmadinejad was scheduled to attend
and speak. __

_[Nikahang Kowsar](http://nikahang.blogspot.com/)_ , a leading cartoonist and
blogger in one of his cartoons show a homeless Ahmadinejad in New York, asking
the Statue of Liberty for a place to stay. In the cartoon's caption we read:

> “Sister, don't you have an empty house or a mouse hole for rent for a week?”

Here is a video inviting people to protest against Ahmadinejad in the name of
martyrs. The video displays a collection of posters and photos used in Iran's
demonstrations.

At _United4Iran_ ,a non-partisan collaborative network working for human and
civil rights in Iran, we[ read](http://united4iran.org/):

> Where Is My Vote NY, along with other grassroots organizations, invite you
> to participate in the September 23rd & 24th demonstrations at the UN
> Headquarters in New York City. They are protesting Ahmadinejad’s presence
> due to violations to the human and civil rights of the Iranian people, as
> guaranteed by the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Iran.

_Kaaveh Aahangar_ [explains](http://www.iranian.com/main/blog/kaaveh-
aahangar/why-protesting-against-ahmadinejad-new-york-not-waste-time) in
_Iranian.com_ why protesting against Ahmadinejad in New York is not a waste of
time:

> The media notices when and where a protest is held. Bystanders and passers-
> by notice when a protest event happens. Politicians notice when there is a
> protest. And if the protest is staged well, it will invariably make somebody
> look at the cause with new attitude. Protest events are not persuasive in
> and of themselves, but they invite persuasion. They invite change. They
> invite a second look at the issues and the cause. Protests make the public,
> the politicians, and policymakers aware that people care strongly about that
> particular cause.
