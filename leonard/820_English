U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Guatemala on Friday, March 5
where she met [President Álvaro
Colom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvaro_Colom) and other leaders from
Central America and the Caribbean. She addressed security issues relating to
the War on Drugs and support from the U.S. for normalizing Honduran relations
with the international community. However, she abstained from openly
discussing immigration reform which could affect more than [400,000
undocumented Guatemalans living in the
U.S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Present-
day_countries_of_origin). While many Guatemalan bloggers were eagerly
anticipating the concert from heavy metal band
[Metallica](http://www.metallica.com/page.asp?id=600036#Guat), there are a
couple of posts about Clinton's visit:

Robin Martínez on the blog [CGN
[es]](http://cgnnoticiasdeguatemala.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/que-trae-hillary-
clinton-para-guatemala/) shared a funny anecdote about Clinton's visit:

> Como víctima de su propia naturaleza humana, la señora Clinton sufrió un
> especial momento de resequedad en la garganta que por largo rato interrumpió
> su intervención en la conferencia de prensa. Luego de la tercera de ellas,
> una asistente de la Presidencia se acercó para darle un vaso con agua, gesto
> que Clinton agradeció e inmediatamente resolvió su problema. Cuando bebió su
> fresca agua guatemalteca, esperó unos segundos y con voz nueva, continuó sus
> declaraciones a los periodistas. Como decimos los Guatemaltecos Hillary, la
> pura tos.

As a victim to her own human nature, Mrs. Clinton suffered through a long
moment of dry throat, which interrupted her own press conference. After the
third interruption, a member of the Presidential staff offered her a glass of
water, a gesture that the Secretary was grateful and that immediately solved
the problem. When she drank the fresh Guatemalan water, she paused and in a
renovated voices continued her statement to the press. As we Guatemalans say,
“Hillary, la pura tos.” (Hillary rules!)

However, in more serious matters, Mario Rodriguez from the blog of the Center
for Development Research and Information (CIID for its initials in Spanish),
provides his opinions on Secretary Clinton's motivations for her visit after
[the proposal emerged for creating a new regional
bloc](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2010/02/latin-america-caribbean-
creating-a-new-organization-minus-the-us.html) which would not include the
United States and Canada. Rodriguez [does not buy that it was only about drug
trafficking
[es]](http://ciidgt.org/boletin/index.php/2010/03/05/ah%C2%A1%C2%A1-la-droga):

> Estados Unidos en este campo actua hipócritamente. Utiliza el tráfico de
> drogas como pretexto para militarizar la zona, y como arma política para
> intervenir en los países, ya sea por medio de la cooperación o por medio de
> acusaciones a gobierno no amigos de Estados Unidos de propiciar el uso de su
> territorio para el tráfico de drogas. Por eso la visita de Hillary Clinton
> al país para hablar del problema del narcotráfico es para reirse.

U.S. is a hypocrite in this issue. Using the illegal drug trade as excuse to
militarize the region, and as a political weapon to interfere in internal
affairs of other countries either by international aid or via accusations
towards governments that do not hold the status of “friends” of US, blaming
them for facilitating illegal drug trafficking through its territories. That
is why I think Hillary Clinton visiting the country “to discuss the drug
traffic problem” is laughable.

Twitter user @yomararnold [jokingly writes that perhaps the real reason behind
Hillary's visit [es]](http://twitter.com/yomararnold/statuses/10006860744) to
Guatemala was her desire to attend Metallica concert.
