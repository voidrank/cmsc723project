**_This post is part of our special coverage of[Egypt Protests
2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-protests-2011/)._**

As demonstrations in Egypt enter their twelfth day, some are becoming
discouraged, but still others have kept high hopes for a positive outcome.
Global Voices author [Eman
AbdElRahman](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/lasto-adri/) is among the
latter; on her blog, she [shares her feelings on the continuing
revolt](http://lastoadri.com/blog/2011/02/06/2589?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+lastoadri+\(Lasto+Adri\)&utm_content=Twitter),
all started by a favorite song:

> On 21st of February 2010, and after watching an interview with Dr. ElBaradei
> on Dream2 TV station, I posted a video for the song “Dream with me” by Hamza
> Namira.. That day I dreamed to see my country free. Free from dictatorship,
> curroption, violance and humiliation. I believed the dream so much that I
> dedicated all my wishes only to see the day when Egypt becomes the one I
> loved before seeing..

Eman continues:

> Today, I saw again the same song with other photos, from the revolution. Our
> revolution.. I was suddenly trembling and shivering. I never told anybody
> before that I am still in disbelief.. Despite living it minute by minute,
> and second by second for the past 12 days, I can’t believe what is
> happening. Sometimes I wake up and tell myself “I must have been dreaming”.
> But it is not a dream anymore..
>
> I have so much to say. So much to write to behold the memory, but words
> stand so small in front of what I am experiencing now.  
>  I just knew how deeply I love Egypt, more than I thought I really do..

The video, as well as her blog post, have caught on on Twitter, with others
sharing their thoughts.

Dreaming of a better future for Egypt has become a theme on social media;
another video speaks of dreams of revolution:

On Twitter, @randa610 [shares her own
dream](http://twitter.com/#!/randa610/status/34003445774163968) for Egypt:
