For several Iranian bloggers, the current [Egyptian
protests](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/28/egypt.protests/) and
activist use of social media, is a vivid reminder of the [2009 post-election
“Green Movement” in
Iran](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2009-special-
coverage/iranian-election-2009/).

Egypt's government has apparently also [ followed in Iran's
footsteps](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/28/egypt-an-internet-
blackhole/) when it comes to repression on the streets and censorship online.

_Viona_ draws parallels between how both Iranians and Egyptians created
Facebook campaigns to help organize demonstrations, and says she is [ happy to
see the anti-dictatorship movement in Egypt
growing](http://jaddeh-88.blogfa.com/post-127.aspx) [fa]. “The Green Wave was
a lesson to all freedom lovers around the world,” she writes with high
expectations for what will happen as protests continue. “The blood of our
martyrs has not been wasted.”

Curiously, Iranian blog _Green Reform_ [predicted something like this would
happen](http://greenreform.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-post_3741.html) [fa] in
August 2010.

> Egypt is nudging towards democracy. Mubarak's regime is sick and people's
> dissatisfaction is rising. 30 percent of the population is unemployed. The
> internet and Facebook are instruments for new groups in Egyptian political
> life and civil society.

_Irangreenrevolution_
[says](http://irangreenrevolution.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/tunis-and-iran/)
[fa]:

> … Democracy is moving forward in Middle East. The uprising in Tunisia is
> extending to Egypt and Yemen. Why are Iranian Green Movement leaders silent?
> People can overthrow the Islamic regime in Iran too.

_Tweatter_ , another Iranian blogger
[says](http://tweatter.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-post_27.html) [fa]:

> Tunisia is free and soon Egypt and Yemen will be free too. The opposition
> leaders and masses in these countries say the same word. ‘Establsihment
> reformists’ broke the back of the protest movement in Iran.

Meanwhile some of the pro-Islamic Republic bloggers, like _Donyaye Syasat_ ,
have focused on the Muslim Brotherhood's role in Egypt. He
[shares](http://donyayesiasat.blogfa.com/post-360.aspx) an interview in
Persian with Ibrahim Munir, one of the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, who
says the situation in Egypt has so bad that he does not believe the
government's military force can stop the people.

On [_Balatarin_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatarin), a popular Iranian
web community, numerous links have been shared to international news articles
about the Egyptian protest movement.
