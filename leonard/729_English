On 17 May, Swiss national Oliver Fricker and his suspected accomplice, Briton
Lloyd Dane Alexander, allegedly breached the perimeter fence at the Singapore
Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) Changi Depot. The two men are alleged to have then
spray-painted graffiti on one of the carriages of the trains.

A video of the incident was posted on YouTube the next day and the online
community quickly picked it up and the video went viral on social networking
sites like Facebook and Twitter, and also on blogs and forums.

SMRT's staff only discovered the act of vandalism two days later, on 19 May,
after the act was first committed. Fricker was charged in court on 5 June for
vandalising the MRT train by spraying graffiti on it and damaging public
property by cutting a wired fence. An Interpol arrest warrant is out on Lloyd
Dane Alexander. The Briton is believed to have left Singapore and is in Hong
Kong. In Singapore, vandalism is punishable by up to three years in jail or a
maximum fine of S$2,000, plus three to eight strokes of the cane.

While SMRT apologised for the security breach, displeased bloggers have been
asking why security was so poor at the depot.
