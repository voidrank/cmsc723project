Falling victim to scams in Bolivia is not uncommon. Attempts to swindle people
out of money come in all shapes and sizes, and often come at times when people
are most vulnerable, in a hurry or when they are alone, for example. There is
a term called “El Cuento del Tío” that is often used to describe these tricks
targeted on people in attempt to receive money or other material goods. There
is no exact translation for the phrased, but it loosely means, “The Uncle's
Story” and can refer to a relative or the [god of the mine
shafts](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/devilsminer/mountain.html).

Two bloggers from El Alto share their experiences of being deceived, as well
as a failed attempted to be tricked, respectively. They both wanted to share
their stories, so that the same thing does not happen to anyone else.

Nancy Condori of _El Chairo [es]_ [retells her experience during some travels
with her mother](http://elchairo.blogspot.com/2008/12/una-estafa-en-la-
terminal-de-buses-de.html), where they fell for a convincing story:

At approximately 8 pm, we were in the bus terminal in El Alto looking for a
bus heading to Potosí, and since my mother is a businesswoman, every once in
awhile she takes merchandise to that city; since it was a high demand day
there was no longer any seats. We were so desperate to travel that the
delinquent must have noticed and approached us offering to take us. He
indicated that there was an empty bus coming from La Paz, and that he could
help us load the cargo, assuring us that he was an employee of the X bus line.
However, in exchange, we needed to pay him in advance in order to reserve
space. My mother gave him a considerable amount for advance payment for this.

However, we did not go to the office of this company to make sure that this
man belonged to the staff, until the bus arrived to stop. My mother boarded
the bus and I told the bus assistant that they were loading the suitcases and
cargo. The assistant asked for the bus fare and I told him that I already paid
the other assistant. There is no other assistant, he responded. I became
scared and when my mother noticed what was happening, made a huge fuss because
the man already charged her and did not appear at that time, we didn't know
what to do. Maybe it was our fault for trusting and for not making sure what
the thief was telling us and we could not get out money back. It was a scam
that could have been avoided had we bought the tickets at the ticket counter.

Marisol Medina of _Lengua, Cultura y Sociedad [es]_[ was a little more
vigilant when she soon noticed that things were too good to be
true](http://lenguaculturaysociedad.blogspot.com/2009/06/el-cuento-del-

I was in the Ceja (area of the city with a lot of pedestrian and public
transport traffic) in El Alto, waiting for some friends. For some strange
reason, I arrived early and because it was Sunday, there were not many people.
I was alone and soon two women approached me saying that they were from the
COCA COLA company and that they were giving away prizes.

One woman gave me a calendar with two wrapped papers. She told me to open them
to see what I had won (what was incredible was how fast the woman spoke, she
really confused me). I opened the first paper and according to her, I won 10
bolivianos (approximately $1.50 USD), which made me happy. Later, she told me
to open the second paper and told me that I had won 15 t-shirts, which
according to her, I must pick up at the company with my identification card.

Later, she told me that I should give her 100 bolivianos (approximately $14.00
USD), if I wanted to win more prizes. That is when I realized that it was a
trick. I sneered, which I could not hide and she asked me what was wrong and I
told her nothing. The woman continued and asked if I wanted to win more
prizes, and I said No! She asked to see my mobile phone and I continued to say
No! The women hurriedly left and took the 10 bolivianos that I had supposedly
won. I think they realized that I knew about their trick.

These types of attempted scams happen in every large city in Bolivia, and
comes in different variations. These bloggers share their experiences, so that
others can spot similar attempts in the future.
