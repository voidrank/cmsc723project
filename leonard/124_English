In Peru, the official signing of Decree 003 on April 15, which permits the
import of genetically modified (GM) seeds into the country, continues to
generate debate between those in favor of the widespread use of genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) and those who fear it would be harmful to the
country's biodiversity and the health of its people.

Despite some experts expressing their approval of GM seeds by claiming that
the resistance and characteristics of the seeds will generate [less
agricultural waste](http://diariocorreo.pe/nota/10425/aducen-que-transgenicos-
generan-menores-gastos-al-agro/), others are casting doubt over the supposed
harmlessness of [food produced from GM
crops](http://www.losandes.com.pe/Opinion/20110505/49479.html) and are warning
the public of the high probability that pollen from GM crops will cross-
pollinate with wild and native crops, thus causing [irreversible alterations
to the traditional plant and
fruit](http://www.google.com/hostednews/epa/article/ALeqM5hWAtQ9ocQSu9xinvkod25bcb-
ChQ?docId=1526176) species which constitute part of the cultural and natural
wealth of local communities.

The popular Peruvian chef, Gastón Acurio, is convinced that GM foods pose a
threat to Peruvian biodiversity. Acurio drew attention to the alleged
[economic interests of the lobby
groups](http://www.larepublica.pe/17-05-2011/gaston-acurio-alarma-mucho-
cuidado-con-los-lobbys) who campaigned for the approval of Decree 003, and is
now asking for “[Peruvian interests](http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-05-17-gaston-
acurio-sobre-transgenicos--tiene-que-haber-un-debate-noticia_366263.html) to
be prioritized and not those of [a few] individuals”.

The issue [prompted the resignation of the former Minister for Agriculture,
Rafael Quevedo](http://www.elsitioavicola.com/poultrynews/21824/rafael-
quevedo-dejo-el-ministerio-de-agricultura), after he was revealed as a [senior
executive of a company which uses GM
produce](http://notasdesdelenovo.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/ministro-de-los-
transgenicos-sabe-para-quien-trabaja/), as is highlighted by journalist Jackie
Fowks in her blog _[Notas desde
Lenovo](http://notasdesdelenovo.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/ministro-de-los-
transgenicos-sabe-para-quien-trabaja/)_.

Although Quevedo denied this claim, he was a [staunch advocate
](http://www.larepublica.pe/03-05-2011/ministro-quevedo-prohibir-ingresos-de-
trangenicos-afectaria-el-tlc) of cultivating genetically modified crops in
Peru. Moreover, one of his advisors, Alexander Grobman, owned companies which
marketed GM seeds and has also [just been
dismissed](http://elcomercio.pe/economia/760916/noticia-minag-separa-polemico-
asesor-pro-transgenicos) by the incumbent minister, Jorge Villasante.

Meanwhile, the Minister for the Environment, Antonio Brack Egg, has reminded
the country that some [ 65% of Peruvian agriculture depends upon the country's
biodiversity](http://www.inforegion.pe/portada/101237/el-90-de-los-peruanos-
no-desea-que-ingresen-transgenicos-al-peru/), as exporting national produce
and collecting tourism-generated funds raises over 8 billion dollars per year.

In Peru, the import of GM corn and soy is only permitted if the produce is to
be used for feeding animals or if it is to be added to foods such as oil or
soy milk.

It is calculated that each Peruvian consumes [63kg of GM corn each
year](http://www.larepublica.pe/12-05-2011/cada-peruano-consume-al-
ano-63-kilos-de-maiz-transgenico). The fact that Peruvian laws still [do not
regulate what information is provided on food
labels](http://elcomercio.pe/gastronomia/760919/noticia-comemos-transgenicos-
sin-saberlo_1) regarding whether or not food contains genetically modified
produce represents an additional problem.

Several regional organizations are demanding a moratorium on Decree 003.
According to the Minister for Agriculture, the proposed moratorium should last
for [five years](http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-05-18-villasante-considera-
adecuada-moratoria-de-5-anos-para-transgenicos-noticia_366580.html), in order
to foster greater public debate and thus inform Peruvians of all the
implications associated with the planting and growing of GM seeds, with the
aim of reaching a consensus on the issue.

The National Convention for Peruvian Agriculture, specialists, food experts
and citizen organizations are not asking for a moratorium, but instead for the
Decree's[ immediate repeal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex4hPJQGGac&).
Several local governments (Cajamarca, Huánuco, Cusco, Ayacucho, San Martín,
Lambayeque and Lima Metropolitana) have even written [ordinances proclaiming
themselves “GM Free”](http://moqueguano.blogspot.com/2011/05/gobiernos-
regionales-y-transgenicos-en.html), hoping to protect the different native
varieties of potato and other local produce.

In this same regard, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers has
established that the Multisector Commission responsible for making proposals
to Biosafety regulation should be established by the[ 1st of June
2011](http://www.larepublica.pe/19-05-2011/en-junio-se-instalara-comision-
multisectorial-que-evalua-reglamento-sobre-transgenicos) at the latest and is
aiming to release a report within no more than 30 days.

The debate gained greater significance in the public sphere when the famous
chef, Gastón Acurio, became involved in the matter, which[ he has followed
very closely on his Facebook
wall:](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150187892148130&set=a.400866313129.176698.49647718129&type=1&comments)

We are not against GM produce. We are against the fact that GM seeds may
contaminate our agriculture and that it is the people who sell these seeds who
want to impose their own made up rules on us. Peruvian agriculture is and will
be recognised throughout the world.

Peruvian netizens have been playing an active role in the matter by
campaigning from different perspectives. _[Toustodo's
Blog](https://toustodo.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/%C2%A1no-a-los-transgenicos/)_
highlights some of the risks that would result from establishing [GM
farming](https://toustodo.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/%C2%A1no-a-los-
transgenicos/) in Peru:

> Sabemos lo que está detrás de todo esto, como también sabemos las
> consecuencias ambientales que acarrearía; no solo son los inmensos intereses
> financieros y económicos que se solapan tras un manto de progreso, más aún
> sabiendo que de implementarse esta tecnología el Perú sería arrastrado a la
> inopia más brutal cuando solo cuenta con el 3.81 % de suelos aptos para
> cultivos en limpio y 37 % de suelo forestal.

We know what is behind all this, just as we know the environmental
consequences that will ensue. The immense financial and economic interest is
being concealed behind the veil of progress, especially when we know that
implementing this technology, would drag Peru into a dangerous state of
ignorance when it only counts 3.81% of its land as being suitable for
renewable agriculture and 37% of the forest floor.

Toustodo continues:

> Por lo tanto, existen dos alternativas. La primera talar bosques y convertir
> el área en suelos cultivables, aún a costa de que sabe que son forestales;
> las consecuencias ecológicas, ambientales y económicas serán desastrosas.
> Segundo, comprar las tierras de los pobres, generando con esto caos social,
> desempleo, penurias…

There are, therefore, two alternatives. The first being to cut down forests
and to convert the area into arable land, even at the cost of knowing that
they are forests, the ecological, environmental and economic consequences
would be disastrous. The second alternative is to buy land from the poor, thus
generating social chaos, unemployment, hardship etc.

[Francisco Estrada](http://francisco-
estrada.blogspot.com/2011/05/transgenicos-el-aspecto-del-que-menos.html)
emphasizes that approving the use of GM seed will threaten small scale
farmers:

> …pasemos al punto más maligno del asunto (…) Las semillas transgénicas
> tienen una patente. Es decir que los campesinos están obligados a pagar por
> esa semilla cada vez que quieran cultivar.

…Let's get to the worst part of the issue (…) GM seeds have a patent. That is
to say that farmers are forced to pay for the seed each time they want to grow
it.

In her blog
_[Kiwichita](http://kiwichita.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/transgenicos-amenaza-
sabiduria-ancestral/)_ , Ana María Quispe highlights that due to posing a
threat to traditional food and farming in villages, the spread of GM crops has
become the cause of poverty, malnutrition and greater reliance on government
assistance.

Alberto and Kathy from the blog _[Cada Plato Es Una
Fiesta,](http://lashistoriasdeuncocinero.blogspot.com/2011/05/la-pelea-por-
los-transgenicos.html)_ directly accuse Monsanto – the company considered to
be the largest producer of genetically modified seeds – and list the other
[environmental, sanitary and economic dangers presumed to be
associated](http://lashistoriasdeuncocinero.blogspot.com/2011/05/el-genocidio-
de-los-transgenicos.html) with the growing of such seeds.

In his blog,[ Antonio
Velarde](http://antoniovelarde.blogspot.com/2011/05/normal-0-21-false-false-
false-es-pe-x.html) highlights the fact that amongst these presumed dangers,
the risks to public health have not yet been studied:

> En lo personal no consumiría estos productos sobre todo por precaución
> debido a que no estoy informado referente a los posibles efectos en la salud
> de las personas que consumen estos productos (…) es una vergüenza que
> viviendo en un territorio rico en recursos naturales y marinos nuestros
> gobernantes y los peruanos que están ligados a la agricultura, agropecuaria,
> pesca no sepan administrar estos recursos y lleguemos al extremo de importar
> productos de laboratorio que no estamos seguros de su peligrosidad.

Personally, I would not consume these products as, above all, a precaution
owing to the fact that I am not informed of the possible effects on the health
of a person who consumes these products (…) It is disgraceful that despite
living in a region which is rich in natural resources and marines, the
ministers and Peruvians who are linked to agriculture, farming and fishing do
not know how to manage these resources and so instead come to the the solution
of importing produce which has been grown in a laboratory, and whose safety we
are unsure of.

Social networks are also involved in the issue. There are [Facebook
pages](https://www.facebook.com/pages/UNA-GRAN-Causa-Por-un-Per%C3%BA-sin-
Transg%C3%A9nicos/170836529636826?sk=wall) dedicated[ to the
issue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rechazamos-los-
Transg%C3%A9nicos/199660593411404) designed to directly oppose GM produce.

On Twitter, María Jiménez
([@antitaurinahej](https://twitter.com/#%21/antitaurinahej/status/73239501073416192))
says:

> No a los transgénicos en el Perú o sino que se los coma todos Alan Garcia

No to GM produce in Peru. If not, [President] Alan Garcia should eat them all

Francisco Drakerm
([@Drakerm](https://twitter.com/#!/drakerm/status/73370772558712833)) refers
to the fact that the same problem is currently taking place in Chile:

> PERU DILE NO A LOS TRANSGENICOS La guerra de las semillas transgénicas toma
> fuerza en Chile <http://bbc.in/kdtqoL>

PERU SAY NO TO GM The war against GM seeds is gaining ground in Chile
<http://bbc.in/kdtqoL>

The debate continues to fire up social networks in Peru and it is certain that
there will be more news in June, when the Government commission responsible
for the issue will begin revising and suggesting modifications to biosecurity
regulation.
