[organized](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2009/nov/04/iran-student-day-
protests) mass street protests on the 4th of November (13th of Aban), taking
advantage of the official rallies being held on the same day to mark the 30th
anniversary of the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran. The opposition
protests were met with a violent crackdown by security forces.

As has come to be expected, Iranian citizen media recorded “history” on their
mobile phones.

Protesters in Tehran trampled on a portrait of the country's Supreme Leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an act that would have been unimaginable a few months
ago.

A message to Obama: Either you are with us or with them.
