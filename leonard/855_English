![Darfuri girl in red](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2010/02/25927082_674851134d2.jpg)Though the major conflict has
ceased in Darfur, in western Sudan, a [recent U.N.
report](http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/children-continue-
to-suffer.html) says those living in the region still suffer from major human
rights abuses and a fundamental lack of freedoms. The continuing instability
and ongoing attacks have been particularly harmful for Darfur's young people,
as [nearly
half](http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/sudan_darfuroverview.html) of those
affected by the conflict are children.

Since 2003, when the fighting began between rebel groups and Sudanese
government forces in Darfur, the U.N.
[estimates](http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/children-
continue-to-suffer.html) as many as 300,000 people have died. During this
time, more than 2.7 million Darfuri people have also been displaced, forced
into refugee camps in Sudan and Chad. A study released last month
[shows](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60L55Y20100122) that more than
80 percent of the deaths during the conflict were the result of disease, not
violence, suggesting that many people remain at risk even though the fighting
has decreased. To make matters worse, last year the Sudanese government
evicted many international humanitarian groups after the International
Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-
Bashir for war crimes in Darfur; the government continues to
[expel](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article33865) foreign
organizations.

The situation has been especially hard on the country's young people, as an
estimated [1.8
million](http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/sudan_background.html) children
have been affected by armed conflict, many exposed to health concerns, a
disruption in education and other services and brutal violence. In Darfur,
[700,000](http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/children-continue-
to-suffer.html) children have grown up knowing nothing but the conflict and an
estimated [4,500
children](http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/sudan_darfuroverview.html) are
believed to be associated with armed forces and groups. These young people,
however, are not the majority, as youth both within and outside of Sudan have
been vital in raising awareness and funds and trying to bring change to the
region.

Over the past several years, Darfuri children's experiences during the
conflict have been chronicled via their drawings. Some of these drawings are
being used as [evidence](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7923247.stm) submitted to
the International Criminal Court as part of the investigation of war crimes.
In 2005, two Human Rights Watch researchers went to the Chad-Sudan border,
during which time schoolchildren offered them hundreds of
[drawings](http://www.hrw.org/legacy/photos/2005/darfur/drawings/index.htm).
Many pictures showed bombings by Sudanese government forces, shootings, rapes
and the burning of villages. Ethan Zuckerman, a co-founder of [Global Voices
Online](https://globalvoicesonline.org), blogging on _My Heart's In Accra_ ,
[said](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2005/04/29/childrens-drawings-from-
darfur/) the images were powerful:

> “When I was at Human Rights Watch a week ago, there was a pile of these
> sketches on a conference room table, along side a pile of photographs from
> [Janjawid militamen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjaweed). What amazed me
> was how details in the children’s drawings echoed details from the photos –
> the stocks of the automatic rifles, the round shape of the houses, the
> posture of two gunmen riding on horseback. It was immediately clear to me
> that these drawings weren’t of weapons imagined by children, but eye witness
> accounts.”

A Waging Peace researcher collected similar
[drawings](http://www.wagingpeace.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=117&Itemid=30)
in 2007, some of which are shown in this
[video](www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml10CnaICk8). Drawing is also being used as a
way to help children heal, shown in this [video](
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6php53I0Bw), as are other forms of art. The
documentary [Darfur Plays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpJ2qoyJEdk) shows a
group of two dozen young people in [Nyala](), the capital of South Darfur, who
are using street theater to spark discussion and increase awareness. Tambay,
blogging on _Shadow and Act_ ,
[comments](http://www.shadowandact.com/?p=13890) on the film:

> “Love this!
>
> Art makes a difference in Darfur, where a troupe of self-taught young actors
> take theatre into the streets and refugee camps.
>
> Their medicine for ailing Darfur is theatre, drama, song and dance – a
> testament to the power of art to heal!”

Young people outside of Sudan are also working to raise awareness and improve
conditions for Sudanese youth. In addition to a host of celebrities, youth in
many Western countries have been drawn to the situation in Darfur. Youth
initiatives over the years have varied greatly, from [creating
poetry](http://anapesi.blogspot.com/2009/01/inspiring-young-people-tammy-
vaitai.html) and [organizing
rallies](http://www.enoughproject.org/blogs/youth-united-darfur-rally-chicago)
to [podcasting](http://youthradio.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/many-voices-for-
darfur-project/) student voices and [finding fundraising programs](dollars for
darfur: http://blogfordarfur.org/archives/133).

And the initiatives continue. In Canada, the youth-led group STAND Canada has
developed a campaign called [‘Stand For The
Dead.’](http://www.standforthedead.com/home.html) Beginning [this
month](http://s275830457.online.de/2010/01/12/darfur-cinema-tour-2010/),
Canadians will be encouraged to wear t-shirts bearing one Darfuri victim’s
name and the group will be showing a film called Darfur. Lori L. Tharps,
blogging on _My American Meltingpot_ , came across a different Darfur t-shirt-
campaign years ago and at first
[questioned](http://myamericanmeltingpot.blogspot.com/2006/09/darfur-is-
hip.html) its effectiveness:

> “Throughout the day in New York City, I kept seeing more and more teenagers
> with Darfur t-shirts on. Like it was a fashion statement. Like supporting
> Darfur was cool. At first I was amused, then a little perturbed, like ‘did
> these wealthy White kids have any clue what modern-day genocide really
> meant?” But then I reasoned, even if they didn't, they were increasing
> awareness with their simple black & white t-shirts…
>
> …Black teens, White, Asian…I'm seeing a multicultural mix of young people up
> in arms for not only the victims of Darfur but for people around the world
> who are suffering, caught in the crossfire of violence. I stumbled onto the
> website Teens4Peace and was overjoyed to see that American teens have more
> to care about than MySpace, Ashlee Simpson and the latest iPod
> manifestation.”

Meanwhile, a high school in Long Island City, New York, organized a
[fundraiser](http://storiesfromdarfur.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/thank-you-from-
nyala/) in December to help youth in Nyala. The blog _Stories From
Darfur_[elaborates](http://storiesfromdarfur.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/from-
youth-in-queens-to-youth-in-nyala-darfur/) on the event:

> “I received an email from a friend and activist in Nyala Darfur. He works
> with a group of youth who are trying hard to preserve and nurture Darfur’s
> musical and cultural heritage. The youth write and perform their own songs
> and develop theater pieces based on issues their communities care about the
> most. Some of the pieces are nostalgic and speak of life before armed
> militias violently displaced them, others are purely entertaining while
> others are calls for justice, freedom and peace. For war affected youth and
> their audiences this group is a great forum for expression, community
> building and healing. My friend asked us to help them start a mini
> orchestra…Our youth at Long Island City High School decided to support their
> effort and packed their school’s auditorium last Thursday for a Talent Show
> fundraiser. From Hip Hop dance performances to an impersonation of Lady
> Gaga, they put together a 30 act show that raised over $800.”

Other strategies are being used to engage even more youth. A few years ago, a
free, online, student-developed video game called [Darfur is
Dying](http://www.darfurisdying.com/) was released. In the game, players learn
about the conflict and must keep their refugee camp functioning despite
possible attacks. The game has led to at least
[50,000](http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/blog/entrepreneur-
interviews/interview-with-jason-rzepka/) people taking action to help end the
violence. Steve Rothman, blogging on _The Social Media Soapbox_ ,
[critiques](http://socialmediasoapbox.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/darfur-is-
dying-can-a-video-game-help-solve-a-humanitarian-crisis/) the game:

> “To play the game, you first select from one of several Darfurian avatars,
> but they are no more than cartoon figures. Perhaps if a fictional profile
> for each of the figures had been provided, it might have had that effect. I
> also wondered if transforming such things as foraging for water or hiding
> from the militia into game objectives could potentially backfire and
> desensitize people to the plight of Darfurians…
>
> …Nobody will be spending hours playing Darfur is Dying in order to “keep
> their camp functioning,” the stated goal of the game. But of course that
> isn’t the point. I imagine the greatest value of this game, and others like
> it, will be to engage a mass audience of young people in social issues and
> causes — an audience that is less accessible through more traditional
> communications channels.”

Whatever the method, Emily Holland found that increased awareness is exactly
what some youth in Darfur want. Blogging for the International Rescue
Committee, she talked to about 50 young people in a refugee camp. When she
asked them, “What is your message to young people your age around the world?,”
they [said](http://www.ircblog.org/archives/1930_1321467639/206964):

> “We want them to know about our activities and our problems.
>
> We want them to support us. To understand that we need education and
> healthcare.
>
> The individuals whom people from outside Darfur are exposed to are not
> always necessarily from the camps. We want youth from all over the world to
> see what life is like here. To hear the real story.”
