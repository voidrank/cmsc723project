On June 10, 2011, [Croatia was cleared](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
europe-13725558) to become the newest member state of the European Union.
There is still a long road before Croatians are officially a part of the EU,
and the timing at the moment is, at best, precarious, creating many skeptics.

Beyond the current state of the economy in Europe, there is also the fact that
on April 15, 2011, the [ICTY convicted](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
europe-13092438) former generals [Ante
Gotovina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Gotovina) and [Mladen
Markač](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mladen_Markač) of war crimes.

As [noted](http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/15/croatian-generals-convicted-
of-war-crimes-crimes-against-humanity/) on _This Just In_ :

> The verdict was greeted by boos and hisses from crowds gathered in the
> central square of Croatia's capital, Zagreb, the BBC reported. The generals
> are regarded by some as national heroes.

This public opinion is important to note, as prior to joining, Croatia will
hold a national referendum which, if held currently, could fail with
approximately only [38 percent voting “yes”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
europe-12111568) or could pass easily with [64 percent voting in favor of
joining](http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/croatia-enlarge.7fc/), depending on
the source.

Despite this electorate uncertainty, the Croatian government has continually
pushed forward on the joining, as [noted](http://www.jutarnji.hr/ulazak-

hrvatska-do-kraja-lipnja-zavrsiti-pregovore-/954922/) [hr] on _Jutarnji List_
:

Of course, most of the accession frustration in this country of 4.5 million
people revolves around the length of time it has taken to get to this point,
as was [written](http://gosponprofesor.blog.hr/2011/06/1629287132/daju-nam-
ali-tako-da-im-ne-udemo.html) [hr] on _gospon profesor_ :

A commenter on that post by the name of [_Kinky
Kolumnista_](http://kinkykolumnistica.blog.hr/) [hr] approaches the pending
accession from a practical standpoint:

Much will still be expected of Croatia in the next two years, but currently
everything points to their becoming the 28th member of the EU.
