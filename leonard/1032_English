![Kami](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/11/Kami22.jpg)As the children's show [Sesame
Street](http://www.sesamestreet.org/home/) celebrates its 40th anniversary
this month, premiering its new season today, one cute and cuddly Muppet on its
South African edition continues to help combat and raise awareness about
HIV/AIDS.

While Sesame Street is seen in over [140
countries](http://www.sesameworkshop.org/newsandevents/sesameupdates/sesame_40thbirthday),
each version addresses local issues and has different Muppets. Golden-yellow
[Kami]( http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Kami ) made her debut on the South
African Sesame Street co-production, called [Takalani
Sesame](http://www.schooltv.co.za/TakHome.htm), in 2002 in response to the
country's HIV/AIDS problem. The world's first HIV-positive Muppet, she helps
educate kids about the disease and confronts issues related to being HIV-
positive. The name Kami is
[derived](http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aroundtheworld/southafrica) from the
Setswana word “Kamogelo,” meaning “acceptance.” Sunshinestar110, blogging on

about Kami:

> “Kami is a healthy HIV Positive, affectionate 5 year old orphan who is a
> little shy but quickly joins when approached in a friendly way, She also
> knows a lot about HIV, she lost her mother to the disease. When Kami was
> unveiled, with her mop of brown hair and she also wore a vest, wandering
> onto Sesame Street and wondering nervously if the residents will want to
> play with her. She didn't have to worry because the other Muppets
> enthusiastically welcomed her.”

Kami was introduced to help the many children in South Africa who are dealing
with the HIV/AIDS crisis. South Africa is believed to have the highest number
of people infected with HIV in the world — an estimated [5.7
million](http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/south_africa.asp)
people. Approximately 280,000 of those infected are children 14 and younger
and there are 1.4 million orphans in the country due to AIDS. In addition to
the physical complications of having HIV, there's also the stigma and taboo
that comes with having the disease, which makes it harder for people to
receive adequate treatment and support. Takalani Sesame, which incorporates
all 11 of South Africa's official languages, tries to help children address
some of these issues head on through Kami.

However, there was much controversy when Kami was introduced, particularly in
the U.S., as many were outraged that a children's show would feature an HIV-
positive character. _Haven on Earth_[elaborates](http://haven-on-
earth.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!C13DE188EF218F14!382.entry?sa=500695506) on the
debate:

> “Although it was reported that Kami's arrival on Sesame Street in South
> Africa was welcomed (I have a hard time accepting this as fact because of
> the still high level of denial still there), there was definite controversy
> here in United States. I remember reading about this (which is why I was so
> pleased to actually encounter a show airing while in South Africa – it would
> have never occurred to me to look for it). Apparently a group of Republican
> congressmen sent a letter to the President of PBS (Public Broadcasting
> Service) that airs Sesame Street. The letter protested that plans to
> introduce a similar HIV-positive character in the United States in due
> course were inappropriate, given the age of the audience. They suggested
> that such a move might threaten public funding of PBS [Public Broadcasting
> Service].”

Kami has never appeared on the American Sesame Street, though she has proven
to be a very successful character on Takalani Sesame and beyond. In 2003,
UNICEF [appointed her](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_16631.html) as a
global “Champion for Children.” In this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eXlNn-C8BY), she joins former U.S.
president Bill Clinton to deliver a message about HIV/AIDS. Jamie, blogging on
_No day but today…_ , [discusses](http://phaino.blogspot.com/2006/12/world-
according-to-sesame-street.html) Kami's other successes.

> “Since most South African children know someone who has AIDS, the character
> has become a national hero, beloved by the country's people. Kami has
> appeared at the United Nations and the World Bank and was interviewed by
> Katie Couric. She has also been named a UNICEF ambassador for children and
> has appeared in Takalani segments alongside Desmond Tutu and Nelson
> Mandela.”

Despite Kami's success, some bloggers still believe that she's not an
appropriate character for the American version of Sesame Street. Emily Meyer,
blogging for her honors class,
[says](http://hons101fall09eem.blogspot.com/2009/10/kami-hiv-muppet.html):

> “Although it is important for Americans to know about HIV/AIDS and the
> seriousness of the diseases, I think teaching kids at the ages of two and
> three is a little extreme. Children this young would most likely not
> understand about HIV and would not understand its consequences. If Kami was
> to be introduced in the United States as a way to spread knowledge and
> combat AIDS, I do not think the intended results would occur…Kids in America
> are not forced to deal with the issue of HIV/AIDS at that young of an age. I
> think the appropriate time for kids in America to learn about the
> seriousness of HIV is when they are older, about ten or eleven years old or
> when the student becomes sexually active”

Still, many bloggers, such as this one [writing
on](http://beckyluz.wordpress.com/2008/12/16/kami-the-hiv-positive-muppet/)
_Muppets and History_ , see Kami has another example of how Sesame Street has
pushed the boundaries. Others [profess their
love](http://joburgjoblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/celebrating-aids-research.html)
for the Muppet and the message she brings to children. And still others think
she should be introduced on other versions of Sesame Street. On her personal
blog, Steisha Pintado
[says](http://steishapintado.wordpress.com/2008/12/18/final-grades-kami/):

> “She shows children that it is okay to hug someone who is HIV positive, and
> she explains what to do when she has a cut on her finger or if you have a
> cut yours. She teachers her young audience about coping with illness and
> loss…Even though sex is never mentioned when talking about Kami’s condition,
> some people have said that having an HIV positive character would be
> inappropriate for a young viewing audience. One legislature even claimed
> that the Sesame Workshop would lose its government funding if it aired a
> program with such a character in our country. It is so shocking to hear
> these words. Parents spend less and less time with their children, and allow
> the television to educate them more and more. So obviously many parents
> aren’t teaching their children how to handle delicate subjects of awareness
> and acceptance. Parents have already allowed the Sesame Workshop to
> introduce acceptance with those who have disabilities and illnesses, and
> also with those who are a different race or religion. How is this any
> different?”
