Caste system in Nepal has long discriminated against a certain section of
society. These people are the so called “untouchables” or the
[dalits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit) who are treated as second class
citizens by the community members. The constitution of Nepal guarantees
equality for the dalits but in the real world, outside long winding provisions
of the constitution and legalese, the dalits are still openly treated as less
than human.

Limited access to education, scarce employment opportunities and
discrimination embedded in social structure have severely restricted growth
and development of dalits in Nepal. For dalit women, the situation is even
worse.

Blogger _Kiran_ at [_Everest Uncensored_
](http://www.everestuncensored.org/7940/2009/10/14/dalit-women-and-their-
major-issues/) discusses about Dalit Women and their issues:

> “When we talk about Dalit women they suffer from triple discrimination as
> oppressed by the so-called high caste people (which equally affects both
> male and female Dalits), oppressed by the design of the Hindu patriarchal
> system and oppressed by Dalit males. 90% of Dalit women in Nepal live below
> the poverty line and 80% of Dalit women are illiterate. These women are also
> vulnerable to serious health issues, sex trafficking, domestic violence, and
> suffer from social, political, and economic powerlessness.”

With 80% of dalit women struggling with illiteracy, odds could not be stacked
higher against them. Dalit women are also often target of racially motivated
attacks by the so called “higher” caste members of society. _Renu Kshetry_ at

writes about a dalit woman who was attacked in a village near capital
Kathmandu:

> Recently B.K., a Dalit woman, was the victim of a heinous crime – she was
> tortured, beaten and forced to eat human excreta. The person who
> orchestrated this barbaric act was a supposedly educated woman: Bimala Lama.
> The principal of the local Gadi Bhanjyang Primary School, Lama accused B.K.
> of practising ‘witchcraft’.

The incident took place earlier this year, unfortunately, is not isolated.
Every year dalit women are victimized, and very few manage to get justice.

Some dalit women, however, are working to achieve what was previously thought
to be impossible. A temple is Kathmandu's Baneshwor area now has a [dalit
woman as priest](http://trak.in/news/dalit-woman-priest-works-silent-
revolution-in-nepal-feature/6917/).

> “The 43-year-old is the priest at the Chhakkubakku Bhagwati temple in the

> Besides being a woman, she is also a Dalit, a community that stands at the

In constituent assembly elections held on April 10, 2008, a number of dalit
candidates-including women, were elected and dalit leaders hope that increased
political participation will help end discrimination.

Here is a [video](http://www.youtube.com/v/p3PS5T1sGxE) in Nepali by
_NepalNews.com_ which features dalit leaders to discuss how the country's new
constitution should be shaped so that caste discrimination ends definitively.

For more information on Nepal's dalits, you can visit [Nepal Dalit
Info](http://www.nepaldalitinfo.net/), which has informative articles, studies
and latest news on Nepal's dalit movement in both English and Nepali.

Law against discrimination has been on the books for long in Nepal, but the
caste system continues to ostracize one community. It is clear that unless
dalits-especially women, are given the opportunity educate themselves the
practice will continue to find new victims.
