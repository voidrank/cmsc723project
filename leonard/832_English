Lenka is a joyful 5-year-old and Paula is an interior design student in her
early twenties. You wouldn’t think that they have anything in common but they
do. They both have cancer and they both have blogs describing their fight with
the disease.

These blogs are good examples of how today’s blogosphere is evolving. They
prove that a blog doesn't necessarily have to be just an online diary: it may
become a very powerful social media tool.

In one of her first posts Paula describes the moment when she was diagnosed
with a potentially deadly disease:

> It felt like someone just smacked me in the face with a frying pan

And how she later realised that a diagnosis doesn’t necessarily mean the end:

> It was like a spark; a spark of hope and willingness to fight. Something
> that made me believe that despite what was happening I could live a long
> life and my body could fight any disease, no matter how deadly.

Paula’s cancer turned out to be a very rare one and soon after the operation
she was told that there is not much conventional medicine could do to help
her. ‘Your tumour is malignant and we don't know how to treat it,’ said the
Polish doctors throwing up their hands. Luckily, Paula’s sister found out
about a [clinic in Boston](http://www.dana-farber.org/), which had
successfully treated patients with the same problem. Paula contacted the
American hospital and soon received an invitation to a consultation. The
doctors were happy to start the treatment, the only problem was its cost, a
staggering $250,000. But Paula didn’t give up here either. She started using
her blog to ask for financial help. Thanks to the generosity of her readers
and other bloggers linking to Paula’s website, the money was soon raised and
in August last year Paula flew to the United States to undergo an operation.

Today she still has numerous tumours in her lungs and needs more treatment,
but she remains positive and optimistically looks into the future. In an
[interview for the Polish edition of
Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/ja_kobieta/paulina-pruska--
zaplanowalam--ze-bede-zyla,46219,1) she was asked whether she was still
scared. She said:

> Yes, but when I am scared I think about my arrival from Boston. My friends
> are waiting at the airport. They are all happy, jumping and waving at me. It
> is a sign that everything went okay. I’ve decided that I will live and so I
> will.

Paula might have never started a blog if it wasn’t for little Lenka and a blog
written by her parents, which inspired Paula to write about cancer.

Lenka was diagnosed with leukemia last April, soon after her fourth birthday.
Ania and Andy, her parents, decided to start a blog when they couldn’t keep up
with informing friends and family about Lenka’s condition. They soon realised
that writing is a form of catharsis. Lenka’s blog has many followers, who
comment on the posts in order to comfort and support both the little girl and
her parents:

> Let’s keep our fingers crossed. Lena must get better. She must!!!! There’s
> no other option, and you, her parents, keep being strong. You are a great
> family!!

> I hope that the sun will soon shine for this little girl and for you guys…
> Remember to always have hope and to believe… She looks like a little angel.
> I hope she will be healthy. I will have her in my prayers. Fingers crossed.

It’s the comments, the parents say, that keep them going and motivate them to
carry on writing. Lenka’s condition has recently improved slightly and she is
now waiting for the weather to get better so her parents can take her out for
a long-promised ice cream.

Both Lenka’s and Paula’s blogs were entered into the 2009 [Blog of The
Year](http://www.blogroku.pl/) competition and thanks to the votes of their
readers they both reached the finals.
