![LiveEarth](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2010/04/LiveEarth-100x100.jpg)On April 18, 2010, the Dow Live
Earth Run for Water took place around the world. The event consisted of a
series of 6-km run/walks, which represents the average distance many women and
children walk every day to secure water, that took place over the course of 24
hours in countries around the world, featuring concerts and water education
activities aimed at igniting a tipping point to help solve the water crisis,
as [noted](http://liveearth.org/en/therunforwater) in the official web site.

Cities as far as Cape Town, Chicago, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Milan,
Melbourne, Mexico City, Minneapolis, New York, Sao Paulo, Toronto, Singapore,
Stockholm, Rio de Janeiro, Washington DC., Manchester, and others were part of
this big crusade for awareness.

Lima, the Peruvian capital, was not an exception. That Sunday, early in the
morning, the district of
[Miraflores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraflores_District,_Lima) welcomed
all the runners and walkers participating in the run.

Starting point from another perspective

[Paradero 20 [es]](http://paradero-20.blogspot.com/2010/04/carrera-por-el-
agua.html), a blog with several authors and collaborators, begins its post
published the day before the race, by saying:

> Sí generamos conciencia, generamos un cambio. El mundo sufre de escasez de
> agua. Países como Irak, Siria, Jordania y algunas zonas de Turquía y Líbano
> han sufrido los devastadores efectos de la peor sequía que el Medio Oriente
> ha vivido en décadas. Sin ir muy lejos, en el Perú la pérdida de reservas de
> nieve y pronósticos de poca lluvia nos podrían dar el mismo panorama.

If we generate awareness, we generate a change. The world is suffering from
lack of water. Countries like Iraq, Syria, Jordan and some zones from Turkey
and Lebanon have suffered the devastating effects of the worst drought
experienced by Middle East in decades. For instance, in Peru the loss of snow
reserves and forecasts of little rain might end with the same panorama.

The blogger from [_Hola es un Gusto_
[es]](http://holaesungusto.blogspot.com/2010/04/carrera-corre-por-el-
agua-6k-se-corre.html) shares the reasons why she supports this cause stating:

> Por eso apoyamos “Corre por el agua 6k”, carrera que tenemos la obligación
> de apoyar para generar conciencia sobre un recurso sin el cual la vida no
> sería posible.

That'a why we support “Run for the water 6k”, race we have the obligation to
support in order to raise awareness about a resource without which life
wouldn't be possible..

Angélica Pereyra from the blog [El Contact
[es]](http://www.elcontact.com/2010/04/6k-live-earth-run-for-water.html) added
a video and the following message:

> Más de 190 ciudades participan el mismo día del mayor evento mundial para
> solucionar la crisis del agua. Sumate!!

Over 190 cities participate on the same day of the biggest world event to
solve the water crisis. Join in!!

Live Earth [stated](http://www.correporelaguaperu.org/) that each year, 1.8
million people (90% of them are children under the age of 5) die of diarrhea.
By 2025, two thirds of world population might live in stress situation due to
the lack of water.

Finishing line

In Peru, water access [has
increased](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Peru)
from 30 to 63% in the past 28 years. And there have been advances concerning
the disinfection of drinking water and in sewage treatment. Although, many
challenges still remain, from Wikipedia:

>   * Insufficient service coverage.
>   * Deficient sustainability of built systems.
>   * Tariffs that do not cover the investment and operational costs, as well
> as the maintenance of services.
>   * Institutional and financial weakness.
>   * Excess of human resources, poorly qualified, and high staff turnover.

Besides that, it is always important to raise awareness in the population
about the importance of the rational use of this vital natural resource.
