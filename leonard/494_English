[Cosplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay) (costume play), is a way of
expression in which participants use costumes and accessories to represent
their favorite characters, usually from
[manga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga),
[anime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) or video games. Cosplay has
followers all over the world and Latin America is not the exception.

The passion of its followers (Cosplayers) is reflected not only in their
elaborate costumes, but also in their interest in promoting Cosplay and to
share their own adventures through personal blogs, Facebook, Flickr and
Twitter.

Cosplay goes beyond dressing up in a costume. In the website _[Imperio
Anime](http://www.imperioanime.com/) _[es] __ from Costa Rica, Miroku explains
[what Cosplay is](http://www.imperioanime.com/cosplay/cosplay-historia/) [es]
and what it entails, clarifying:

> Aunque no todo es vestirse; no. No se puede olvidar la parte ‘play’ de
> CosPLAY.  
>  Gran parte de todo esto es pretender ser ese personaje al que se esté
> interpretando. Esto también es muy importante, además de divertido. Aunque
> solamente sea para una foto, o durante todo el evento o fiesta, o incluso
> para alguna dramatización; sin olvidar lo entretenido que puede resultar.

But it's not just about dressing up; no. We cannot forget the “play” part of
CosPLAY.  
A big part of all this is to pretend to be the character that is being
performed. This also is very important, besides being fun. Even if it is just
for a photo, or during all the event or party, or even for just a
dramatization; without forgetting how fun it can be.

The blog _[Cosplay Ecuador Elite](http://cosplayecuadorelite.blogspot.com/)_
[es] promotes Cosplay and interviews cosplayers from all over the world. The
author has interviewed cosplayers from Italy, France, Mexico, Argentina,
Panama, Peru and Chile, among others. In these interviews one can learn more
about the concept, the work involved, the motivation of the cosplayers, their
family's support and how complicated it becomes to store all those cosplays
(costumes) when the collection is increasing.

The blogs and websites dedicated to Cosplay also approach some issues within
the community.

In Costa Rica, Crys from the blog _[Cosplay de Costa
Rica](http://cosplaycostarica.blogspot.com/2009/09/la-categoria-del-cosplay-
no-es-excusa.html) _[es], wrote last year about the lack of humility that
sometimes is shown by some cosplayers:

> Ser un cosplayer de calidad, es un trabajo duro y que requiere mucho
> esfuerzo, nadie lo puede negar, pero últimamente algunos de estos cosplayer
> han tomado el titulo de *superiores* a otros cosplayer que no son tan buenos
> o si lo son pero simplemente quieren tratar de hacerse los importantes ante
> todos.

Being a quality cosplayer, is hard work and it requires a lot of effort,
nobody can deny it, but lately there are some cosplayers that have assumed the
title of “superiors” to other cosplayers who are not as good or they may be,
but simply they want to make themselves more important than everybody else.

However the author clarifies that:

> Hay muchos (por dicha son más) que son totalmente diferente; siempre se les
> ve escribiendo en los foros procurando hacer más emocionante el tiempo de
> espera de los aficionados que lo leen y anhelan con ansias los eventos,
> nunca niegan nada a nadie y lo mejor saben dar cumplidos a los otros
> participantes para así motivarlos más; creo que esa es la actitud que se
> debe tener ante las personas, que de cierta forma admiran el trabajo que los
> cosplayer realizan y mostrarce siempre agradecido ante ellos…  
>  Nada Cuesta un Simple Gracias!! o sonreir ante los demas…

There are many (fortunately they are the majority) that are totally different;
they are always writing in the forums trying to make the expectation of their
followers more exciting and they wait anxiously for the events, they never
deny anything to anybody and the best part is that they know to give
compliments to other participants in order to motivate them; I think that is
the right attitude that must be shown to other people, to those that in some
way admire the work that the cosplayers do and always showing gratitude to
them…  
It is not that hard to give just a Simple Thank You!! or to smile at others…

Through their blogs, some cosplayers share the techniques used to make their
costumes. In the blog _[Panama Cosplay
Tutorials](http://panamacosplaytutorials.blogspot.com/) _[es], the author
explains in his posts how he accomplishes some elements in his cosplays. The
last entry was for [“Dr. Stein from Soul
Eater”](http://panamacosplaytutorials.blogspot.com/2010/07/dr-stein-de-soul-
eater.html) [es], where it is easy to appreciate the ingenuity used by
cosplayers to get the effects that they are looking for. For example, Kohaku
(nickname of the blog's author) explains how he built the head of the screw
that this character uses:

For the head of the screw I used a cereal bowl [as a template] from my house
XD because the size fit my head, I recommend you use something that doesn't
make you look disproportionate, you can build it from a drop ceiling tile or
foam, whichever works for you.

Also from Panama, the blogs _[Konekotan](http://www.konekotan.blogspot.com/)_
[es] and _[Alatariel's Cosplay](http://alatariels-cosplay.blogspot.com/)_ [es]
[en] write about Cosplay and publish photos, videos, tips and events.

The blogs _[Bolivia Cosplay](http://boliviacosplay.blogspot.com/)_ [es] and
_[Myo Blog](http://myo-rlz.blogspot.com/)_ [es] also share photos that show
Cosplay activities and events in Bolivia.

_Myo Blog_ also offers [Cosplay tutorials](http://myo-
rlz.blogspot.com/search/label/tutorial%20cosplay) [es], and even one on [how
to make boots without boots](http://myo-rlz.blogspot.com/2010/08/tutorial-
cosplay-como-hacer-botas-sin.html) [es]. Judging by the comments in this
tutorial, her creativity benefited others and was received with a lot of
gratitude.

The blog _[Amacosplay](http://amacosplay.mangaempire.net/)_ [es] from
Venezuela also has some tutorials, as well as an entertaining description
about her beginning in Cosplay and her growth as a cosplayer. In her
[blog](http://ama25586.livejournal.com/) [es], Ama or Meroko (nicknames of
this cosplayer), has shared the happiness and difficulties of the cosplayer:
raw material limitations, not having enough money and the satisfaction of the
finished projects. Her [last entry](http://ama25586.livejournal.com/8725.html)
[es] shows how the economic realities of a country interfere with people's
dreams and passions. Ama wrote:

> Pues si ._. cada vez se pone más difícil la cosa, y em doy cuenta que de

Well yes…each day things get more difficult, and I realized that I was living
in a bubble…now we don't have water, neither power, money and [we are] without
food…I want to do my cosplays but now I think that I am not going to be able
to make them

In the same post she adds:

> han caído todos, siento como si no pudiera hacer más planes… ni siquiera
> tengo la menor idea de dónde estaré ni qué estaré haciendo dentro de 1 año…
> es suficiente para hacer que me preocupe

the future is so uncertain that I am worried..and the plans that I have done
have all fell through, I feel like if I cannot make any plans…I don't even
know where I am going to be neither what I am going to be doing next year…it
is enough to make me worried

_[Cosplay Peru](http://cosplayperu.com/)_ [es] is another specialized website
and they have photos and videos about Cosplay in Peru as well as interviews
and coverage of international events. Also from Peru, there is _[Guía Cosplay
de Todos](http://cosplayperu.blogspot.com/)_ [es] which also promotes cosplay
and showcases events and contests. Most recently they showcased Mister Cosplay
and Cosplay Performance (group) contests.

In Mexico, the blog _[Exolimpo](http://blog.exolimpo.com/)_ [es] covers many
subjects, within them Anime, Manga and Cosplay. Related to Cosplay, they have
written about the prejudices and negative criticism based on ignorance of what
Cosplay entails, as well as the pros and cons of being a cosplayer. These
subjects have been approached in two posts: [“Cosplay: Waste of time and
money?”](http://blog.exolimpo.com/2009/08/cosplay-desperdicio-de-dinero-y-
tiempo.html) [es] and [“Cosplay:
Madness?”](http://blog.exolimpo.com/2009/09/cosplay-locura.html) [es].

Despite the fact that not every cosplayer has an active blog, it is evident
that the Latin American community is significant and Cosplay has passionate
followers around the region. In the interviews published by _[Cosplay Ecuador
Elite](http://cosplayecuadorelite.blogspot.com/) _[es], it is clear how much
effort cosplayers put in their characters. At the end, it is more than just a
costume; there is a lot of creativity, patience and work involved in
accomplishing a successful Cosplay. At the same time, there is the process of
learning their character in order to portray it during team performances.

Most of them put in many working hours and as Kiren explains in the post
“[Cosplay: Waste of time and money?](http://blog.exolimpo.com/2009/08/cosplay-
desperdicio-de-dinero-y-tiempo.html)” [es] there are several benefits that
people can get out of cosplay: learn new things, make new friends, have fun
and overcome shyness.
