According to the Cuban daily newspaper [_Granma_](http://www.granma.cu) __
[es], [United States Agency for International Development
(USAID)](http://www.usaid.gov/) subcontractor and United States (US) citizen
Alan Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Cuba on March 12, 2011,
after being convicted of illegally distributing information technology
equipment to Cubans.

Under the court ruling in Cuba, this constituted an “[[act] against the
independence or territorial integrity of the
state](http://www.granma.cu/ingles/international-i/7marz-AlanGross.html).”

Cuban authorities arrested Gross at José Martí International Airport in Havana
on December 3, 2009, when he was attempting to leave Cuba after his fifth
visit to the island. Gross had [brought IT equipment to small civil society
groups](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/world/americas/13cuba.html?_r=1)
there while working as a consultant for [Development Alternatives, Inc.
(DAI)](http://www.dai.com/), a for-profit international development company
that is a frequent subcontractor with USAID. [Gross entered the country
](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/maryland-contractor-alan-gross-
draws-15-year-sentence-in-cuba/2011/03/12/ABL6lMS_story.html)on a tourist visa
(rather than a special visa for aid workers), and did not have government
permission to distribute these materials.

[He was
held](http://www.thejewishchronicle.net/view/full_story/12191530/article-Alan-
Gross%E2%80%99-trial-in-Cuba-ends?instance=news_style) in a high-security
Cuban prison for fifteen months, without any formal charges, and his March
2011 trial was closed to reporters. Cuban authorities have released only very
general statements about the proceedings. Press covering the event have relied
on the accounts of different figures involved, which has led to a somewhat
uneven public understanding of exactly what Gross was doing in Cuba.

[Cuban Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/) author and Cuba policy
expert Phil Peters has exposed some of the holes in mainstream coverage of
this case. [He has directed
readers](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2011/03/alan-gross-and-cuban-
law.html) to both USAID and Cuban legislative documents proving that in 1999,
the Cuban government made it illegal for Cubans to receive assistance from
USAID programs. In a post written shortly after Gross’ arrest, Peters
commented on how the Cuban government views these programs:

> Havana tends to see [USAID] as part of an off-and-on, 50-year U.S. effort to
> [affect] regime change…[they] lump the current program in with the embargo,
> the Bay of Pigs, and a long list of covert and overt [US] efforts to
> overthrow their socialist government.

He argued that regardless of how good Gross’ intentions may have been, the
program he was working for is seen as a force for political subversion in
Cuba. He wrote:

> It’s one thing to run civil society programs in countries where the local
> government is unopposed, it’s quite another to do so in a communist country
> that perceives the program as a national security threat.

Gross is also [mentioned](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/16/cuba-
cyberwar-video-sparks-debate-anger-skepticism/) in the viral “cyberwar” video
released in February of 2011, which featured [Cuban cyber security expert
Eduardo Fontes](http://vimeo.com/19402730) describing US efforts to undermine
the Cuban government by installing secret WiFi hotspots around the island, as
part of a “cyberwar” tactic.

The Cuban government has interpreted this as a threat to national security,
but this is contingent upon what they believe about the power of information
and communication technologies (ICTs) in this context. This then raises the
question: exactly what did Gross bring to Cuba? On this subject, blogger and
Cuba scholar [Larry Press](http://laredcubana.blogspot.com/2011/03/what-did-
alan-gross-actually-do.html) notes that different media reported items ranging
from “sophisticated satellite communications equipment” (Raúl Castro, quoted
in the _[Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/01/06/AR2010010604509.html)),_ to “cell phones,
laptops and other communications equipment” ([ _The New York
Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/world/americas/12cuba.html)), to
“BGAN Satellite ground stations” ( _[El Progresso](http://progreso-
semanal.com/4/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3190:caso-gross-

Regardless of the potential impact (real or imagined) of what Gross attempted
to do, it is clear that the Cuban government chose to prosecute Gross because
he represented an example of a program that they see as a threat to national
sovereignty. Many Cuba-focused advocacy groups are using this as a case for
why such programs should be permanently discontinued in Cuba, but it remains
to be seen what difference this will make.

Cuban blogger [Iván García](http://translatingcuba.com/?p=8228) remarked that,
“[t]he real enemy of the Castros is not Gross. The American is nothing more
than a good currency of exchange. It’s not bad for negotiating with the
Yankees. Or as a political show. Little more.”

If Gross is lucky, the US will find some way to bargain with the Cuban
government so that he can be sent home, and the real issues at hand can come
to the fore.
