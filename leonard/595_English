It's been almost 20 months since the change of regime in Madagascar and the
return to constitutional order still seems to be a long struggle for the
embattled island. A referendum on a new constitution has been scheduled for
November 17 [(initially scheduled for August
12](http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=60644)). The referendum is
still heavily disputed by both the opposition and the international community
that has [withdrawn a few of their
representatives](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE68R1T9.htm) in
the country because of the constitutional vacuum.

After [hitting multiple road blocks and the absence of some of the original
contributors ](http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/Une-Constitution-a-huis-
clos,14731.html)(fr), the [new constitution proposal](http://www.madagascar-
tribune.com/PROJET-DE-CONSTITUTION-DE-LA,14822.html) [fr] has been finalized
this week. Many Malagasy bloggers have dissected, analyzed and reacted to the
major points of the document.

On the blog _Fijery_ , a lawyer and guest blogger Sahondra Rabenarivo __
highlights the shortcomings of the proposal and notes that this new proposal
is essentially the same text as the former constitution drafted in 2007. She
[explains](http://fijery.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/les-vacuites-du-projet-de-
constitution-vues-par-une-juriste/) [fr]:

> Sur **160** articles à l’origine, hors dispositions transitoires, seules
> **trois** phrases ont été effacées ; environ **39** phrases, alinéas,
> paragraphes ou articles ont été ajoutés ; et **23** articles ou sous-
> articles ont été modifiés. La structure et les grandes rubriques de la
> Constitution de la 3è République demeurent donc inchangées, [..] les
> dispositions transitoires de ce texte prévoient le maintien au pouvoir non
> seulement de Andry Rajoelina mais aussi de toutes les institutions de la
> transition jusqu’à la mise en place des institutions de la soi-disant 4è
> République, sans date limite.

Of the 160 original articles of the constitution, except for the temporary
ones related to the transitional period, only three sentences were withdrawn.
39 sentences, articles or phrases were added and 23 modified. Therefore, the
structure and overall organization of the third republic remain unchanged [..]
The amendments relative to the transitional period stipulate that Andry
Rajoelina is to stay in power and that all the institutions of the transition
are maintained as they are until the fourth republic is established without
any firm deadlines on the end of the transition

_Patrick_ warns that some the proposal is already being modified by the
constitutional advisory committee after the official document that was
presented to the press on September 24. He points out that this post-
conference imodification would essentially[ negate the clear separation of the
executive power from the judicial power](http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/La-
subordination-de-la-Justice,14823.html) [fr].

Proposed Referendum Ballot for Madagascar Constitution Change

_Madagoravox_ posts [a comprehensive
table](http://madagoravox.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/nouvelle-constitution-les-
tableaux-danalyse/) [fr] that reviews all the modifications and addendum to
the constitution and what it means in layman's terms.

Nevertheless, a few minor proposed changes in the new text has already
triggered a few discussions in the Malagasy blogosphere. For instance, It
seems that the official languages will be effectively[ reduced to Malagasy and
French](http://twitter.com/#!/Toshikoshi/status/26339837805) [fr], removing
English as an official language. Blogger _Razanajatoma_ also notes that the
[motto of the Republic would be
changed](http://razanajatoma.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/%C2%AB-
fitiavana-%E2%80%93-tanindrazana-%E2%80%93-fandrosoana-%C2%BB/) from
_“Tanindrazana, Fahafahana, Fandrosoana”_ ( “Fatherland, Liberty, Progress”)
to _“Fitiavana, Tanindrazana, Fandrosoana”_ ( “Love, Fatherland, Progress”).
The irony of[ introducing “love” as an intricate part of the fabric of a
nation still profoundly
divided](http://citoyennemalgache.hautetfort.com/archive/2010/10/03/parlez-
moi-d-amour.html) is not lost on _Citoyenne malgache_ [fr]. _Madagate_ , a
website ideologically close to the current government, argues that the
addition of “love”in the new national motto would be[ in agreement with
Malagasy's traditional spiritual sensibility](http://madagate.com/politique-
madagascar/dossier/1533-madagascar-cest-parti-pour-la-campagne-referendaire-
avec-le-bulletin-unique-.html) [fr].

_Achille52_ is not all that impressed with all the hype around this new
constitution when he sees what is going on in the daily life of the
population. He [offers a list of practical decrees
](http://reflexiums.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/madagascar-les-cons-des-
institutions/) that he would have liked to read in the text [fr]:

> Que les prix des PPN ne font pas le yoyo au gré des spéculateurs  
>  Que les policiers ne demandent pas des pots de vin à chaque occasion  
>  Que les hôpitaux guérissent les malades au lieu de les tuer  
>  Qu’on ne nous vende plus des aliments périmés sous prétexte que c’est bon
> marché  
>  Qu’on ne pille plus les forêts pour construire des opéras en Chine

That the price of staple products stops fluctuating to the whims of
speculators  
That policemen quit asking for bribes every single time  
That hospitals actually heal patients and not ill them.  
That expired foods are no longer being sold under the pretense that it's cheap  
That we stop pillaging our forests to build opera houses in China.

On the subject of the [ illegal logging of rosewood in
Madagascar](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/20/madagascar-the-
undercover-investigations-that-exposed-rosewood-trafficking-from-the-rain-
forest/), [Foko ](http://club.foko-madagascar.org)and [ICE
club](http://iceclub-mada.com/) bloggers have urged their readers to[ sign a
petition drafted by the World Wildlife
Fund](http://wwf.panda.org/how_you_can_help/campaign/ac_detail.cfm?ActionUrl=http://buffy.bluegecko.net/action/53dac752-d4c7-44bc-
be0d-bab29a9eb71b) (WWF) and addressed to the transitional president Andry
Rajoelina and his director of cabinet Zaza Manitranja Ramandimbiarison that
demands an immediate stop to the illegal logging activities and the concrete
application of the decree 2010-141 banning rosewood logging and export.

Unsurprisingly, Madagascar has [dropped from 56 to
48](http://allafrica.com/stories/201010040519.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)
in the latest edition of the Ibrahim Index of African Governance.

Supporters of the new constitution argue that it is the only way to exit the
current political quagmire and move the country towards reconciliation. The
director of Rajoelina's cabinet addressed an [open letter towards two former
presidents of Madagascar](http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/Lettre-ouverte-de-
Zaza-M,14557.html) [fr], pleading for them to join and support the effort of
the transition to move forward towards reconciliation.

Madagascar Constitution Explained by Cartoons

On my _Mydago_ , Solo Razafy compares and contrasts the process towards a new
constitution in Madagascar today and in South Africa in 1990 and the need for
more information and awareness about the constitution. He [posts a reflection
by the aforementioned lawyer Sahondra
Rabenarivo](http://mydago.com/2010/10/tandremo-fa-mamitaka-ny-loko/) [mg/fr]:

> l’approche pragmatique de la RSA quand à la « réconciliation nationale » fut
> de mettre en place des commissions droits de l’homme, égalité des genres,
> etc au sein même des institutions constitutionnelles. Ces commissions sont
> chargé de suivre la mise en oeuvre des principes constitutionnels d’égalité

The pragmatic South African approach to national reconciliation was to put in
place Human Rights Commission, gender equality commission etc in the fabric of
the constitutional institutions. These commissions were responsible of
monitoring the implementation of the principles of equality and human rights.
You can see right there, the emphasis on communication and transparency on one
hand and the educational aspect on the other hand [..] The “never again” motto
can only start with raising awareness and being open about the content of the
constitution [..] Of course, South Africa has decisively more resources andthe
international community was much more involved etc, I am just pointing out
that they overcome the lack of education [of part of the population] and the
way they sought out a true legitimacy was admirable on many levels.
