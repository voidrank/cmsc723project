An international [tsunami
warning](http://www.detiknews.com/read/2009/09/30/174704/1212114/10/peringatan-
tsunami-dikeluarkan-untuk-indonesia-malaysia-thailand-india?991101605) [id]
has been issued for Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and India, but was lifted
about an hour later.

Indonesian news agency Antara
[reported](http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1254326936/bnpb-75-orang-
meninggal-akibat-gempa-sumbar) that the death toll has reached 75, but may
surge since there are still victims buried under the rubble, while many still
choose to [stay
outside](http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nusa/2009/09/30/brk,20090930-200134,id.html)
[id] of their houses fearing further tremors would strike.

According to First Secretary Purnomo Sidik of the National Board for Disaster
Management (BNPB) in Antara, the BNPB headquarters in Jakarta haven't received
detailed information from the field due to communications disruptions in West
Sumatra.

Fifty percent of the city has sustained damage and [inbound flights to Padang
were cancelled](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/09/30/flights-padang-
canceled-after-quake.html) following damage to the runways at Minangkabau
Airport.

The Indonesian twittersphere is filled with sympathy messages, updates to and
from relatives, and relief reports.

aditdmit: I've just witnessed the aftermath of Padang quake, this evening the
evacuation is being postponed due to heavy rain and electricity outage, 75% of
the city paralyzed. Hopefully the victims are given strength and perseverance.
Amen.  

The Vice President, Jusuf Kalla, shortened the swearing in of new parliament
members and sent six ministers to the location to assess the damage.
