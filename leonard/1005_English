Brazil lost today one of its pioneers digital activists. [Daniel Pádua
[pt]](http://imaginarios.net/dpadua/) (also known as
[@dpadua](http://twitter.com/dpadua) on Twitter) had been recently diagnosed
with cancer and lost the battle this morning, in Brasília. Always present in
open source software and free culture events in Brazil, he was a strong
reference for many bloggers in posts about ciberactivism and freedom of speech
on the Internet.
