Pakistanis were shocked by [the
news](http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=3.1.1242428228) that
over 1,000 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack that killed 19
people in Karachi a few days ago.

Allegedly this lethal bomb attack in Karachi's high-security Red Zone was
carried out by the Pakistani Taliban. This bomb aimed to target the Criminal
Investigation Department police quarters near the Sindh’s provisional chief
minister's seat opposite the Sheraton hotel in the south of the city.

Among the 115 people injured in the blast were some high profile militants
being help at the CID quarters. They have now been moved to an undisclosed
location.

The destruction caused by the explosives is massive. It shook buildings,
shattered glasses and people’s sense of security. The sad fact is that this
has become a routine Pakistanis are being forced to live with.

_Kalsoom_ at _Chup: Changing Up Pakistan_ [adds](
http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/) a personal thought that forces us to
think beyond what we have been hearing in news:

The resilience shown by the Karachi locals is commendable. These people are
still recovering from the gang wars and the target killings of recent times
and yet they go on with their lives like it is just another day.
