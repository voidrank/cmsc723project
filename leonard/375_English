[Reports of shootings](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/18/breaking-
bahrain-more-gunshots-in-capital/) in several locations in Manama, the
Bahraini capital flooded social media websites during the afternoon of Friday
February 18, 2011. Videos made in different locations show not only the
moments when shots were fired, but also the victims in the aftermath (WARNING:
graphic images).

This first video shows a familiar face from a [previous
post](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/18/breaking-bahrain-more-
gunshots-in-capital/): the victim speaking with the reporter was seen carrying
a wounded person away from the protest. From the
[video's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdANNv8R7Dg) description:

> Victim speaking with a news reporter after an attack on their protest and
> get attacked again  
>  Translation not exact”  
>  “We were going there, chanting peaceful peaceful, we even raised our hands
> (other person:says we even had flowers), they were not kidding, they've had
> machine guns, not riffles or hand weapons, literally machine guns with
> tripod, and they open fired, people ran away! A person in front me instantly
> died after a head shot, I tried to grab him and carry him away, I was in
> complete state of shock”

People [are seen jogging away from the
protests](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeBVAjs4eeY) and the reason why
becomes obvious as the sound of gunfire is heard, causing another flood of
runners including children.

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USAMc_OUFn4) shows protesters
walking towards the Pearl Roundabout (Lulu) chanting “Peaceful, Peacefully”
when gunshots are heard.

[This next video ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwnUQcKXmMM)shows another
perspective of the event, capturing images of the aftermath: some protesters
lie on the ground, blood around them, while their fellows scream in anguish
over their still bodies. (WARNING: graphic images)
