As Japan and the rest of the world struggle to make sense of the devastating
earthquake, tsunami, and [nuclear
scare](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/15/usa-science-bloggers-explain-
fukushima/), science bloggers are sharing facts to help explain what happened.
Where science bloggers excel is not only understanding what happens, but
knowing how to explain it so anyone can understand.

**The Earth deformed**

Theoretical astrophysicist Ethan Siegel of Scienceblogs.com's [_Starts With A
Bang!_](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/03/why_physics_gives_us_earthquak.php)
provides a basic explanation:

> The Earth is built like a giant, spherical layer cake. The inner core — made
> up of mostly iron and nickel — is the densest of all the layers, while the
> lithosphere — the Earth's crust — is the least dense… if we want the _most
> stable Earth possible_ , it would be a perfect “onion”, with the densest,
> heaviest elements being concentrated at the center, and then — with each
> outer layer — a progressively lower and lower density. And it wants to be
> like that, _packed as tightly as possible_ , the same way that a stone sinks
> in water, an iceberg floats on an ocean, or a helium balloon rises in air…
> unfortunately, the Earth is _not_ in its most stable possible configuration
> right now. But, over time, gravity is doing everything it can to help it get
> there. How? By bringing denser, more massive chunks closer to the center,
> and uplifting lighter, less dense pieces… And that's what happens — energy-
> wise — every time we have an earthquake!

Meanwhile, Chris Rowan, a geologist in Chicago, provides a great primer of
what happened in Japan his blog, [_Highly Allochthonous_](http://all-
geo.org/highlyallochthonous/2011/03/magnitude-8-9-or-9-0-or-9-1-earthquake-
off-the-coast-of-japan/).

Interestingly, Siegel and many other scientists (such as Irene Klotz at
[Discovery News](http://news.discovery.com/earth/japan-earthquake-time-sped-
up-110314.html#mkcpgn=rssnws1)) say that by bringing more dense material
closer to the earth's core the earth's rotation speed actually increased –
shortening our day by a very small fraction of a second. The principle is
similar to what one sees when a figure skater or dancer spins and then speeds
up by folding in her or his arms.

Sadly, John Horgan at Scientific American's [_Cross
Check_](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=japan-earthquake-
demonstrates-the-l-2011-03-11) blog says science is not at the point where we
can accurately predict earthquakes, though it's not from lack of trying. The
most obvious tactic – trying to predict earthquakes by examining previous
earthquake data and looking for patterns or precursory events – hasn't worked.
Further:

> Many other prediction methods have been proposed and in some cases tested.
> These involve detection of such alleged quake precursors as surges in ground
> water; emissions of the radioactive gas radon; fractoluminescence, or
> flashes of light emitted by compressed rock; unusual tidal activity; low-
> frequency electromagnetic waves; and unusual animal behavior. One long-
> running experiment in Japan involves monitoring catfish, which are
> supposedly sensitive to electromagnetic activity that precedes quakes. None
> of these approaches has proven reliable.

However, this isn't to say that science hasn't saved many lives from
earthquakes. For example, thanks to tremendous advances in the fields of
engineering.

**Tsunamis in slow motion**

By now everyone has seen the [surreal
videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-zfCBCq-8I) of a seemingly unstoppable
wave of debris crashing on shore, engulfing cities and farmland, even dragging
burning buildings in its wake. As people begin to ask what could possibly have
caused such a thing, science bloggers are stepping in to answer.

On _GeoMika_ , physicist and geophysicist Mika McKinnon, provides an
[exhaustive primer on tsunamis](http://www.geomika.com/blog/2011/03/11/an-
introduction-to-tsunami/), and shows how they differ from tidal waves or wind
waves.

[The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
](http://www.youtube.com/user/WoodsHoleOceanInst)posted a video on YouTube
last year (shared by GrrlScientist at Guardian's [_Punctuated
Equilibrium_](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-
equilibrium/2011/mar/14/1)) that shows how water flows during a tsunami.

New Zealand blogger Grant Jacobs also provides [a wealth of
resources](http://sciblogs.co.nz/code-for-life/2011/03/14/tsunami-forecast-
animation-warning-
systems/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciblogsnz+%28SciBlogs.co.nz%29)
from the US Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and
other sources on forecasting and warning systems, including an interactive map
of buoys the US government places to track tsunamis.
