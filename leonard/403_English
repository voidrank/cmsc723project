After months of infighting, bickering and a record setting 17 attempts, Nepal
finally has [elected a Prime
Minister](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=133463072 ).
[Jhala Nath Khanal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhala_Nath_Khanal), leader of
the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist and Leninist), was sworn in on
Sunday, at a ceremony in capital Kathmandu. Although not known for his
charisma or leadership ability, Mr. Khanal has certainly raised hopes for many
who viewed chaos and confusion of past seven months as a serious impediment to
Nepal's fragile peace process.

_Surya B.Prasai_ at[ _American
Chronicle_](http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/216383 ) is one
among the hopefuls. He is confident that:

> ” …the peace process will now come to a definite conclusion in the next few

> the donor community channeled properly to the underprivileged communities in
> Nepal where it matters most. Recently the UN´s Resident Coordinator in

Despite the optimism and a chance for fresh start, there are significant
roadblocks on Mr. Kahanl's path. He cannot ignore Nepal's power crisis which
has severely crippled the country's economy and industries. [_China Dialogue_

Capital Kathmandu is already suffering through 14 hours of daily power cuts.
Jhala Nath Khanal's government will have to find a solution to the energy
crisis before the frustration on the streets boils over.

As a communist leader, Khanal refused to take oath of office in name of God
and some are calling him a hypocrite for this. Blogger _Umesh Shrestha_ at
[_MySansar_](http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2011/02/id/17053) asks:

> “तर शपथ ग्रहण गर्दा त्यही ईश्वरको नाममा शपथ लिन चाहिँ तपाईँ किन अघि
> सर्नुभएन। यदि तपाईँ ईश्वरलाई नमान्ने कम्युनिस्ट हुनुहुन्छ भने बालुवाटार
> प्रवेश गर्नुअघि चाहिँ किन ईश्वरको चित्र भएको कपडा घाँटीमा भिरेर पूजाआजा

But you did not take oath of office in name of God. If you are a communist and
don't believe in God, why did you organize a religious ceremony before
entering the official Prime Minister's residence? Why the double standard?

Will the Gods be irked too? That is for future to reveal but Khanal's term
could be yet another missed opportunity if he cannot manage fixing the energy
crisis and get the peace process moving.
