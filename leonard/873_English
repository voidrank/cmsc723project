Starting with the Syria Accountability Act (SAA) of 2004, the U.S. has
implemented a [series of trade and financial
sanctions](http://damascus.usembassy.gov/sanctions-syr.html) on Syria. The
sanctions are affecting the daily lives of Syrian citizens in several areas
including: travel restrictions and a ban on software and IT export, as well as
business limitations.

Also, the sanctions have hit hard the national carrier, [Syrian
Air](http://syriaair.com/). With a ban on buying new commercial jets or even
spare parts for the existing fleet, the number of operational planes shrunk to
three airplanes only.

Realizing the paralyzing blow to the Syrian air travel industry, a group of
Syrian youth started a campaign in support of Syrian Air. They have launched a
[website](http://prosyrianair.com) and a [_Facebook_
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=256866887246), and have gathered
over a thousand supporters in less than a month. The campaign's website
[states](http://prosyrianair.com/?p=1):

> We are calling all who are in charge to release the sanctions on Syrian Air,
> Syrian Air have the right to buy spare parts and aircrafts..

And the campaigners point out that the sanctions endanger civilian passengers
on board those planes:

> Syrian Air transport civilian from different nationalities.. safety is
> number one in air transportation… Stop the Sanctions NOW!

> دعونا نسمع صوتنا، صوت المواطن السوري العادي الذي يغار على بلده وعلى شركات
> بلده الوطنية. لنسمع صوتنا بالعربية وبكل اللغات الممكنة، دونوا بكل اللغات
> لنوصل صوتنا إلى حكومتنا، الى الحكومة الأمريكية وإلى كل أصقاع العالم بأننا
> نرفض هكذا عبثية غير مفهومة لا تؤذي إلا المواطن السوري المشغول بملاحقة لقمة
> عيشه التي لم تسرقها بعد المافيات التجارية ولم تصادرها العقوبات الغبية.

Let's get our voices heard, the voice of the average Syrian citizen who cares
about his country's national companies. Let's get our voice heard in Arabic
and in every possible language. Write in all languages to get our voice heard
by our government, by the U.S. government, and by everyone else on the face of
the earth. We refuse these absurdities that harm only the Syrian citizen who
slaves to make a living that does not get stolen by commercial mafias, or
confiscated by idiotic sanctions.
