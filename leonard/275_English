As more time passes since the devastating Earthquake that shook Japan on March
11th, people in Japan are feeling the need to return to normal and put the
disaster behind them. Although for many Japanese who lost their homes or loved
ones this will be quite difficult, those who weren't as unlucky feel the need
to do their part and help the economy get back on its feet.

Spanish writer Hector García has been living in Japan for many years and his
blog _[“A Geek in Japan](http://www.kirainet.com/)_ ” has been for many
Spanish speakers a window into the daily life of someone living in Tokyo.
After the Earthquake he's kept his page updated with information on the
effects and aftershocks, giving people the sense of what was happening at
ground level in Tokyo after the quake, and through the nuclear crisis. In his
[March 23rd post](http://www.kirainet.com/la-importancia-de-ser-diversos/), he
writes about the need to get back to normal, since the worry is affecting
those they would wish to help, as people stay glued to the TV or news, afraid
to leave their homes. Businesses have needed to close temporarily, leaving
people who need the money to get back on their feet and help their families in
shelters out of work:

We must help actively through donations and other means, but it is just as
important, if not more so to return to our daily routines. It is important for
all of us to go to the gym, go for some drinks, buy a few books. From afar,
this may seem like a load of drivel, but it is the reality of Tokyo and even
all Japan right now. We must remove our fear, stop watching the news every
minute and go out and enjoy the diversity of life, in this way we will help
the victims and Japan to recover from what happened. The physical health of
tens of thousands in the area of Tohoku is in danger, and the mental health of
millions of people and the economic health of Japan as well.

On the [BoingBoing blog](http://www.boingboing.net/2011/03/23/music-video-
with-sim.html), a Japanese video was featured, and in the words of Ayahiko
Sato from Rakudasan, the video design unit responsible for creating it:

> Now, as you know we are in critical situation by earthquake. However we
> think that what we can do is to get more attention for Japan and Japanese
> creativity. We need positive news to get energetic power, because we are
> showered with negative news.

[Chitaka2000 on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdCC0nll4z0), who
usually posts about cars and other motor vehicles, uploaded a different type
of video instead. He walked around his city of Tokyo and recorded video
showing how daily business has changed a bit; with the city's lights turned
off and people stocking up on batteries. The video is annotated and he
explains signs and other cultural aspects, for example, how Japanese wearing
face masks are not afraid of radiation necessarily but are instead protecting
themselves from hay fever:

[JuneHoneyBee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krUpZNBdwIA) lives in Japan, and
on this next video she tries to focus on showing a bit of how life goes on:

> While there is soooo much destruction and horrible news to focus on, there

> an effort to focus on things happening in other parts of Japan, as people

[Satomihyde2010 on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR4MY1nS7XY) also
does her bit with her tribute to the Japanese people, who through their
suffering are trying to piece their lives together and move on:

[CScout Japan](http://www.cscoutjapan.com/eng/) how life goes on as usual in

[Chiba](http://www.japantrends.com/life-in-chiba-japan-goes-on/) and
[Shinagawa](http://www.japantrends.com/life-goes-on-in-shinagawa-tokyo/).

Chiba Prefecture shows its pride after the quake, by Darrell Nelson

Even in Sendai, which was partly ravaged by the tsunami wave, life resumes
normalcy.[Acofromsendai ](http://www.youtube.com/user/acofromsendai)opened a
YouTube channel after the quake, and has posted videos of different areas of
Sendai in the aftermath, including this one of a Mall near the port of Sendai
where the effects of the tsunami can be seen, and the following, where in
downtown Sendai it's business as usual.

And to close, we quote [Ken Mogi
](http://qualiajournal.blogspot.com/2011/03/importance-of-being-diverse.html)a
Japanese Ph.D. and blogger living in Tokyo who inspired Hector García's post
mentioned at the beginning of this article:

> So one of the difficult but absolutely crucial tasks now is to go back to
> life's diversity, rather than shying away from it. We need a healthy
> entertainment industry. The restaurant sector has to flourish. Books need to
> be sold and read, hotels rooms have to be filled with laughter. While
> investing a substantial amount of our time and energy on the rescue and
> relief efforts, we somehow need to keep life's diversity. Apart from
> thinking about this earthquake and pondering the future of nuclear energy,
> we need to sing a song of the various joys of living.
