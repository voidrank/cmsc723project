If there is one area in which the [Egyptian
Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution) was an
“eye-opener” in terms of social media, it would be how it introduced thousands
of Egyptians to the popular micro-blogging website
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/).

In little over three months, the Egyptian Twittersphere grew, not only in
volume, but also in content and versatility; what started out as a modest,
laid-back community quickly developed into a vibrant socio-political arena,
where everything is open for discussion and there are virtually no taboos or
red lines.

The spirit of these discussions inspired one of Egypt’s active bloggers and
tweeps [Alaa Abd El Fattah](http://twitter.com/#!/alaa) (@alaa) to bring the
best of two worlds – [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and [Tahrir
Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square) – under one umbrella.

The result was [Tweet Nadwa](http://twitter.com/#!/search/tweetnadwa), a
seminar-like gathering in which Abd El Fattah outlined the purpose from in a
[blog post](http://manalaa.net/node/88043) entitled “Birds of a Feather, Meet
Together”.

The gathering took place in the Center of Development Support in Cairo’s
upper-class district of Dokki on June 12, 2011. The topic for this round: The
Islamists.

Already generating a lot of buzz on Twitter, discussing Islamists ranges from
how they are perceived in the Egyptian society to how they envision a civilian
and democratic, post-revolution Egypt. It was only natural that Abd El Fattah
decided to invite some of Twitter’s most prominent Islamists to clear the mist
surrounding these topics up.

Speakers included [Ibrahim Houdaiby](http://twitter.com/#!/ihoudaiby),
freelance columnist for the _Guardian_ and the great grandson of Hassan
Houdaiby, the second General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), as well as
journalists [Abdel Moneim Mahmoud](http://twitter.com/#!/moneimpress) and
[Ahmed Samir](http://twitter.com/#!/ahmedsamir1981), the former being an ex-MB
while the latter remains – to this date – a member of the group.

Over three hours, these speakers discussed their relations to the Muslim
Brotherhood, their economic vision of Egypt from an Islamic perspective in
addition to tackling the tricky question of civil liberties in an MB-ruled
Egypt.

In Twitter fashion, the speakers as well as the participants were only allowed
a 140 -second response to each question (recalling the 140 character Twitter
update limit per tweet) and instead of clapping for speakers, participants
waved their hands to simulate the act of retweeting. In addition, the over-
crowded room was supplied with a large screen displaying the Twitter page
created for the ‘Tweet Nadwa,’ updated with impressions, photos and videos of
the meeting.

Participants largely commended the meeting with users such Hussein Adel Fahmy
[stating](http://twitter.com/#!/7usfahmy/status/79969734237495296) that:

> [#tweetnadwa](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23tweetnadwa "#tweetnadwa") is
> innovative and great initiative. My opinion is Egypt islamic background
> shouldnt contradict with the concept of civil state.

Dr Moustafa Hussein
[praises](http://twitter.com/#!/moftasa/status/80038559117086720) the
performance of Abdel Fattah as the meeting’s moderator while providing photos
of the Nadwa.

And users like Mai Zeiny
[conclude](http://twitter.com/#!/MaiZeiny/status/80028268446760960) that:

> [#tweetnadwa](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23tweetnadwa "#tweetnadwa")
> was a great success, the spirit of tahrir is back. diversity in attendees
> and great dialogue! Thank you [@alaa](http://twitter.com/alaa)
> [@manal](http://twitter.com/manal) & every1

Abdel Fattah [confirms](http://twitter.com/#!/alaa/status/80045788268478466)
that there will be another round of twitter-like discussions:

> Was a great [#tweetnadwa](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23tweetnadwa
> "#tweetnadwa") thanks for all the team, am internetless but we discuss next
> one soon

As he then goes back to the realm of the virtual world.
