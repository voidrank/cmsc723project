Thirty Egyptians, aged 18 to 28, joined hands to produce 10 social
advertisements, aimed at social reform.  
The project, aptly named _Closing The Gap_ , consisted of three phases held in
partnership between [The Egyptian Life Center for Creativity and
Culture](http://alhyaa.net/?p=25) jointly with Freedom House. Its primary
phase included an intensive workshop that took place in July 2009. The goal of
the workshop was to define the Egyptian context of social marketing, prior
social issues that society needs to address through media, along with writing
the ideas and storyboards of the ads.

_Bikya Masr_ group blog [reported](http://bikyamasr.com/wordpress/?p=11678):

> The goal of “Closing The Gap” is to train a group of 30 young media
> activists with interests in new media and its potential role in society. The
> project served these interests by giving them a chance to represent their
> views on the usage of new and appropriate media to advocate progressive
> ideals.

Social Advertising : I'm Egyptian | إعلان إجتماعي : أنا مصري  

Two social ads tackle sexual harassment; the first is a comparison between
Egypt in the seventies and Egypt today

The second is titled:Social Ad : It's Not Your Right | إعلان إجتماعي : مش من
حقك

This social ad is about holding on to hope:

And this one is about Internet Freedom in Egypt:
