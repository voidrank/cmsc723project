On Monday, the Yemeni cities of Taiz and Hudaida were the scene of bloody
crackdown by security forces on peaceful anti-government protestors. Once
again, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Yemeni president for the past 32 years,
responded with force and live bullets to protestors calling for his immediate
removal.

Reuters [reports](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/04/us-yemen-
idUSTRE7310ON20110404) that in Taiz, at least 15 people were killed and 30
wounded when police opened fire. In Hudaida, demonstrators gathered to show
their solidarity to the people of Taiz, but they ended up with the same fate
as their compatriots in Taiz when police and armed men in civilian clothes
shot at them. Eye witnesses also said that they saw snipers on roofs shooting
at protestors.

in Taiz and Hudaida](http://narrabyee-e.blogspot.com/2011/04/clashes-in-yemen-
as-protesters-start-to.html):

> At least three protesters were killed and tens others injured Monday when
> security forces tried to prevent angry protesters from storming the
> Presidential Palace and the government buildings of the local authority of
> Taiz province.  
>  The sources, who are participating in the marches, said the clashes are
> continuing as protesters are insisting on marching and surrounding the
> government buildings. “I myself saw one protester dead in the hospital,”
> said Riyadh Al Adeeb, journalist and activist in Taiz.

He adds:

> In coastal city of Hudieda in the west of the country, clashes between
> security forces and angry protesters are also continuing.  
>  “The new thing today and yesterday is that the protesters are marching in
> the streets and not sitting in their sit-in places,” the protester Abdul
> Hafez Al Nehari, one of the leading protesters in Hudeida, said. “About 400
> were injured by the tear gas used by the security forces today and
> yesterday,” Al Nehari added.  
>  The protesters seem to be planning for marching forward and surrounding the
> important government buildings, in an escalation step to press Saleh to step

**Graphic Youtube videos**

On Monday two youtube videos have been circulating the net. The [first
one](http://www.youtube.com/user/MrKazabanana#p/a/u/1/xHiYjEQlzDs) shows
protestors running away as the sound of gun shots is heard.

The [second one](http://www.youtube.com/user/MrKazabanana#p/a/u/0/Z4FWii0fAzk)
which is extremely graphic, shows an injured man shot in his neck in pain.

**US pressure on Saleh to step down**

On Sunday, April 3, the [New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/middleeast/04yemen.html?_r=1&ref=world)
reports that the US administration has dropped its support for Ali Abdullah
Saleh, a major ally for the US its war against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula. “The United States, which long supported Yemen’s president, even in
the face of recent widespread protests, has now quietly shifted positions and
has concluded that he is unlikely to bring about the required reforms and must
be eased out of office, according to American and Yemeni officials.” reports
the New York Times.

The White House: the effort to combat terrorism with Yemen does not depend on
a single person
