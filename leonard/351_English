Malaysia has recently been gripped by an alarming social issue: suicide. Many
Malaysians are becoming concerned as it is being committed by youths. English
daily The Star
[reported](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/2/10/nation/8035599&sec=nation)
people in the 20-39 year old age group make up the highest number of suicides,
and although an average of two suicides a day is reported, experts believe
that the [statistic could be
higher](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/2/10/nation/8035764&sec=nation).

In the span of a few weeks, two Malaysian youths committed suicide after
revealing their intentions on Facebook.

about a 22 year-old Malaysian, Alviss Kong, who committed suicide after a
failed relationship. In it, he also writes

In a separate incident in February, a 17 year-old high school student jumped
from the second floor of her school a few days after she posted on Facebook
that she wanted to take her own life.
