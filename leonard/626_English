In 2009 Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had come up with the 1Malaysia
unity concept, which was popularized by the media.

Blogger _OutSyed The Box_ [highlighted a news
report](http://syedsoutsidethebox.blogspot.com/2009/04/what-
is-1-malaysia.html) that explains the 1Malaysia concept:

> KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Bernama) — Malaysians should discard their ‘ethnic
> silo’ mentality, said Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.The Prime Minister said
> Malaysians must “stand together, think and act as one people under the
> ‘1Malaysia concept’.”
>
> “Lets break away from operating in the ethnic prism as we have done over so
> many years. This is also the meaning of the ‘1Malaysia’ concept.
>
> “We must respect each other, go beyond tolerance and build trust among each
> other and build trust between various ethnic groups,” he told a press
> conference here, Wednesday.

However, since the introduction of this concept, it has been criticised by
many who believe that racial tension still exist in the country. Blogger
Calvin Chew had [told the story of another
blogger](http://www.calvinchew.com/p/634):

> I’ve heard of the 1Malaysia concept, but I think we don’t need to be told to
> be united. We’ve come such a long way that it should already be embedded in
> our hearts and minds that we are united.
>
> Unfortunately, you can still see racial discrimination and polarisation.
> There is still this ethno-centric view that the Malays are the dominant
> group and their rights must be protected, and non Malays are forever the
> outsiders.

Yet, on the 30th of August, 2010, on the eve of Malaysia's Independence Day,
this view was further strengthened when a story surfaced on social networking
site Facebook about an alleged [racist attack by several
teenagers](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=432073840741&id=586500176):

> As we walked past them, suddenly one of them turned around and started to
> make a flying kick (sic) to my friend. Noticing the ‘fun’ he is having, his
> other friends started to do the same to me. It was so sudden and all I was
> thinking at the moment was, “What the hell did we do to them?”
>
> Both of us ended up kneeling on the ground for a moment before more kicks
> and punches came flying in. Even though both of us had our tripod strapped
> across our shoulder, we were too shocked to react to it. Eventually one
> punch landed right on my right forehead and I started to bleed profusely.
> Seeing that they eventually stopped and walked away.WALKED AWAY, damn it.
> They were not even afraid to run but just WALKED AWAY like winning a game or
> something.The last thing I remember hearing from one of them was **“Baliklah
> ke negara asal”** (Return to your home country in Malay).

While it seems that the 1Malaysia concept is not making much progress, blogger
Khoo Kay Peng [weighed in on the
issue](http://khookaypeng.blogspot.com/2010/08/yes-1malaysia-concept-is-not-
failure.html):

> What is lacking is the political will to implement the real spirit of
> 1Malaysia e.g. offering equality, sense of belonging, fairness, socio-
> economic justice and mutual respect to all Malaysians regardless of race or
> creed.
>
> For the concept to be successful, the BN (Barisan Nasional) government must
> not continue to play its race supremacy game. If a particular race is seen
> as more supreme or privileged than others, the concept of 1Malaysia will
> remain a mere concept without a soul.
