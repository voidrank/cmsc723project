Mexican bloggers debate whether citizen videos and pictures showing graphic
violent crimes are an answer to what some say is the mass media's resistance
to cover drug trafficking related violence or if it is just another way to
spread fear and terror.

For some Mexicans, media is not doing their job in reporting violent crimes,
focusing on criticising the government and state instead of focusing on the
violent drug trafficking and gang activity, making it seem as if they wish to
cover up the gangs activities.

For Carlos Ramírez Hernández, [blogging in La
Palabra.com](http://esp.mexico.org/lapalabra/una/41683/el-medio-no-es-el-
mensaje), not covering gang related crime should not be an option for media,
since he says it will not decrease the actual criminal activity, but just hide
it. Media's role is not to glorify crime, but to report on it, but it has to
be done correctly:

> Los medios, a su vez, han perdido el foco de la información. La mayor parte
> del contenido informativo de prensa, radio y televisión ha insistido en
> criticar severamente al gobierno y al Estado y no a denunciar la
> criminalidad del narcotráfico. Se ha llegado al punto de que algunos medios
> de comunicación parecen narcomantas de los capos y no representantes de la
> sociedad. No se trataría de elogiar por sí solo sino de convertir la
> información en un instrumento social de crítica a una realidad.

Media, at the same time, has lost their focus on information. The greater part
of information content found in press, radio and TV has insisted in severely
criticising government and state and not denouncing the criminality of drug
trafficking. It has come to a point where some mass media sources seem to be
billboards for the drug lords and not society's representatives. It is not
about praising just because, but to transform information in a social
instrument that criticizes reality.

So what role should media take? [Last
month](http://yosoyjuarez.com/wp/?p=12659) 4 reporters and cameramen were
kidnapped by a drug cartel. The ransom requested was for 3 narc videos to be
broadcast by the TV stations. Days after the 15 minute unedited transmission
denouncing the connection between authorities and opposing drug cartels was
shown on TV they were released.

This isn't a new concern, back in 2007, Jorge Zepeda Patterson wrote about the
[role of mass media regarding the narc-videos.

Nevertheless, it isn't easy for mass media to erradicate these topics. While
it is true that TV news has become a grocery list of violent crimes and it
isn't too easy to stop. Among other things, because what is happening is very
serious. Journalists would pay a disservice to the community if we started
speaking about other things while organized crime takes control of Monterrey,
the drug retail struts around in our neighborhoods and schools and the court
houses and police bodies continue getting broken completely by the cartels.
And that is exactly what is happening. A true war is taking place as we speak
in our streets and mountains. A war we are losing. But we'll have even less
oportunity to win it if we offer placebos to public opinion and build an
“ostrich” operation which is distorted but tranquilizing.

The drug cartels are getting net savvy, and some of them now do their own
Public Relations online, finding a fertile ground on YouTube.com, as this
reader sent in to the [“Last of the Dodos”
blog.](http://elultimodelosdodos.blogspot.com/2010/04/aviso-narcotube.html)
The Dodos reviewed the YouTube channel (which has been suspended at this
moment) that called itself the official channel for the Gulf Cartel, where
they asked citizens to denounce members of the opposing Zeta gang if they knew
one, and asked for a peaceful Mexico:

> Un ejercicio de relaciones públicas perverso, que muestra la incapacidad del
> gobierno federal para llevar una guerra de amplio espectro que incluya el
> manejo de la opinión pública.

A perverse exercise of public relations, showing the innability the federal
government has to face a wide spectrum war including managing public opinion.

In [Información Cívica](http://informacioncivica.info/mexico/the-good-bad-and-
ugly-of-online-video-in-mexico/) blog, David Sasaki wrote about the good, bad
and ugly in Mexico's online video scene. On the subject of narco videos, where
drug gangs post videos of executions, beatings, torture and confessions, he
wrote making reference to [Mica
Rosenberg's](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6734E720100804) post on the
subject:

> The anonymously posted videos are of little assistance to federal police as
> they attempt to track down the perpetrators, but they do spread a cycle of
> violence according to Maria Guadalupe Licea, head of the government
> prosecutor’s office in Baja California. “Licea said the use of new
> technologies and media is part of a spiraling cycle of violence in which
> ever more shocking attacks inspire copycat killings,” writes Rosenberg.

But the violent content is not only distributed by the gang members or
supporters: citizens have also been posting graphic images and videos they
take of victims of these drug trafficking ring wars. Reasons to post the gory
material are varied: some like the high ratings and others insist that if mass
media will not inform the public, they will, so that these activities don't go
unnoticed. Some of [the websites](http://www.blogdelnarco.com/) established
for [sharing this
information](http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=2369488)
include areas where people can denounce criminal activity, discuss dangerous
cities, the rise in violence and how the drug cartels operate.

As citizens begin to take the role previously left to mass media, the same
questions are being asked. Is it a disservice to publish the violence many
cities are being subject to, or is it worse to remain silent?
