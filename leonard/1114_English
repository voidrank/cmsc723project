After an intense debate, in which doctors, sociologists, representatives of
the Catholic Church, international health organizations, and politicians
participated, legislators from the [Dominican
Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic) ratified an article
within the Constitutional Reform [that makes it illegal for a woman to
terminate her pregnancy under any
circumstance](http://ourlatinamerica.blogspot.com/2009/04/abortion-banned-in-
dominican-republic.html).

This decision, in which many say the influence of the Catholic Church and the
proximity of upcoming Congressional elections played a large role, places the
Dominican Republic among a small group of countries that Constitutionally
prohibits abortion, including in health-related cases where the pregnancy
places the fetus or the mother at risk. Females who have been victims of
incest or rape also are banned from obtaining an abortion.

The article in question, currently known as Article 30, states: “the right to
life is inviolable from conception until death. The death penalty cannot be
established, decided, or applied in any case.”

Since its preliminary approval in April, [protests have been constant
[es]](http://dominicanoshoy.com/articulos/articulo/hombres-y-mujeres-realizan-
marcha-contra-articulo-30/). Sociologist Rosario Espinal [writes that women
will now be deprived of a healthy and dignified life
[es]](http://hoy.com.do/opiniones/2009/9/22/294726/No-gano-la-vida-contra-el-
aborto), adding that the doctors who performed illegal abortions will charge
more money because of the higher risks.

Many believe that there will be an increase in clandestine abortions as a
result of this decision, as well as higher rates of maternal mortality.
However, the way that the Article was approved is also a subject for many
bloggers.

Luis José López of _Ahí e’ que Prende [es]_ [highlights that the Article 30
has been the most controversial Article debated in this Constitutional
Reform](http://ahiequeprende.com/2009/09/14/cuando-hasta-amnistia-
internacional-habla/), and notes that even the human rights organization
[Amnesty International has come out against the decision
[es]](http://www.clavedigital.com/App_Pages/Noticias/Noticias.aspx?id_Articulo=25902).
According to López, the definition of a person's life merits a profound and
sincere debate in which all interests are represented, and that is something
that did not take place in the Dominican Republic:

> El tema del aborto es un tabú en RD demasiado influenciado por las iglesias
> y las religiones. Mencionar la palabra es inclusive mal visto por muchos.
> Quienes se atreven a cuestionar el status quo, quienes se atreven a decir:
> “detengámonos a pensar” son inmediatamente censurados y condenados por el
> debate público.

The issue of abortion is taboo in the DR, overly influenced by the churches
and religions. To even mention the word is even poorly seen by many. Those who
dare to question the status quo, those who dare to say “let's stop to think”
are immediately censored and condemned by the public debate.

With nearly [89% of the
population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic#Religions)
identifying themselves as Roman Catholic, the Church has strong influence in
all facets of society. However despite this strong faith, some bloggers like
José Rafael Sosa, who is also Roman Catholic, [does not agree that this
personal decision should be regulated by the
Constitution](http://josersosa.blogspot.com/2009/09/una-margarita-y-el-
articulo-30.html):

> Respeto mi Iglesia pero ello no me impide analizar el dificil tema con mi

> no es la Constitución. Nadie en su sano juicio, puede apoyar que se aborte
> una criatura ya formada, genéticamente hablando, siempre que el embarazo sea

> Y eso es un crimen.

I respect my Church, but that does not impede me from analyzing the difficult
topic through my viewpoint. The legal space to face what is called “Criminal
Abortion” is not the Constitution. No one in their right judgment, can support
the abortion of an infant, already developed, genetically speaking, when the
pregnancy is the result of the mother's decision, and not because of rape or
through the intervention of other clinical circumstances. First, the issue
should have been decided by those who bring children into this world, and not
by men looking for votes from the faithful. Second, no one was looking for the
Constitution to consecrate the capricious right to abortion. Abortion is a
social reality that is not governed by the dynamics of approval of
Constitutional articles or laws. Abortion is a social reality that will now
lead to an increase in the mortality of the women that also have a life that
needs to be preserved. The guilty parties publicly voted for this possibility.
And this is a crime.

In the end, some bloggers feel like the legislators arrived at the decision
based on their political interests. In this manner, María Isabel Soldevila
believes that Congress “[turned their backs on the people.
[es]](http://mariasoldevila.blogspot.com/2009/09/senales-de-alerta-
ciudadana.html)” María de Jesús, a reader of _[Diario Libre
[es]](http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias_det.php?id=216156&page=2)_ sums up
her disgust:

> Sarta de hipocritas y a los que se creen que se votó por la vida, cuando una
> mujer tiene que abortar porque su vida esta en peligro y no lo hace SE
> MUEREN LA MUJER Y EL FETO! Balsa de ignorantes! La muerte va a tener un dos
> por uno en Republica Dominicana. Que vergüenza ser dominicana de ahora en
> adelante.

A string of hypocrisy, and those that think they voted for life, when a woman
needs to abort because their life is in danger and they do not, THE WOMAN AND
THE FETUS DIES. What ignorance! Death will now be 2 for 1 in the Dominican
Republic. How embarrassing it is to be Dominican from now on.
