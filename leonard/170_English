Nineteen year old [Jhoncito Arango's](http://jhoncitoarango.blogspot.com/)
most recent web project has certainly caught the local media's eye in his
native Colombia, where his [web series
“Yonkis](http://www.youtube.com/user/YonkisOnline)” [es] has had a very good
reception considering that it tackles a topic that is still considered highly
sensitive in this Catholic country: homosexuality.

Yonkis: A teen gay world

Back in [October 2010](http://jhoncitoarango.blogspot.com/2010/10/ando-
supremamente-contengo-con-mis.html) [es], Jhoncito Arango wrote on [his
blog](http://jhoncitoarango.blogspot.com/) [es]about a future project he had
in mind: he would take advantage of his passion in
[videoblogging](http://www.youtube.com/jhoncitoarango) [es] to do something
bigger- the first [LGBT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT) webshow in
Colombia. He [wrote](http://jhoncitoarango.blogspot.com/2010/11/proyecto-
yonkis-de-jhoncito-arango.html) [es]:

> Esto nos ayudará a dar una nueva imagen sobre nosotros, sobre la **comunidad
> LGTB** , lograremos tumbar estereotipos y quizás reafirmaremos algunos
> otros, pero siempre teniendo presente en dar lo mejor de nosotros y
> demostrar que como jóvenes podemos ser participes del cambio y ser
> activistas de forma pacifica y positiva para nuestro colectivo del que nos
> sentimos orgullosos.

This will help us establish a new image about us, about the **LGBT community**
, we will take down some stereotypes and maybe we will confirm others, but we
will always try to give the best of us and show that as young people we can be
part of the change and become peaceful and positive activists for the
collective we belong to and which makes us proud.

**Launch preparation**

Through his [weekly participation](http://youtu.be/-kysZkwSPSA) [es] on a
collaborative videoblog “The 7 Superstars”, Arango also told his followers
about his project, explaining that after 6 months absence, he was returning
better and stronger than ever.

Having got back with his long-term boyfriend, started a university career in
audiovisual arts, and commenced Yonkis, the series about gay teens in Medellin
which he is responsible for creating, writing, acting, directing, producing
and editing. With so much invested in the series he also kicked off a strong
promotional campaign including teasers,
[trailers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snN7pTw9lBY) and character profiles,
prepping the stage for the serie's premiere:

His fanbase, cultivated through years of publishing videos, has responded
positively to his show, and the first episode has already more than 5700 views
only a week after being released on April 11, 2011. Comments and ratings on
the videos tend towards the positive side of the spectrum.

In the [first episode](http://youtu.be/_R4KC1HZD1I) [es], we follow Juan
Pablo, who has left home after falling out with his homophobic father. Juan
Pablo settles in Medellin and meets a new group of friends, the Yonkis, who
will show him around the city and then he'll meet the group's rival gang, the
Pink Boys:

**Reactions from viewers**

In a comment on the episode, [JJcamachom

HEY!! Kids!! Awesome project, really… since I saw the teasers I thought it
would be great… I only hope that you don't pigeonhole it only in those fights
of streetwalking queen… I hope that you really show the other side… I
personally believe that the gay world (and more so the paisa [person from the
coffee producing region of Colombia]) is obsessed by the streets, alcohol,
drugs and superficiality… I hope that you douse the program with depth… you
will have many visitors so also try to encourage cool things as well…
fidelity, respect, etc.

But of course there have also been detractors, and Jhoncito addresses the
feedback they've received in this post on the [project's Tumblr
page](http://yonkistv.tumblr.com/post/4735957556/comunicado-oficial-de-yonkis)
[es], thanking viewers for positive feedback and constructive criticism which
will help them improve. He also replies to criticism and complaints about how
the show's characters are swishy, queens and effeminate.

What Jhoncito gives them as an answer is that the characters are that way
because they themselves are that way, and that for an LGBT community to fight
homophobia they have to get rid of discrimination within their own diverse
community. He also sets up an invitation: any group which doesn't feel
represented by the series should go ahead and do one of their own, showing how
they live within the gay community and they'll have the Yonkis’ full support.

The [second episode ](http://youtu.be/4IEiBYUTAdE)received more than 300
visits in less than one day. One of the Pink Boys steals a bracelet Juan Pablo
received from his ex-girlfriend, and the Yonkis go to get it back, but they
are challenged to a dance-off and they will need to beat the Pink Boys if they
want the bracelet back. The two gangs meet in a park and as they prepare for
the choreographed dance competition, they realize that reaching a common
ground will be harder than they thought:

The Yonkis series has also been showcased in Colombian
[newspapers](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=215092611836690&set=a.195167793829172.51220.175820132430605&type=1&ref=nf)
[es], radio and TV shows. In this [radio
interview](http://www.caracol.com.co/llevar.aspx?id=1452304) [es], Jhoncito
candidly replies to the presenter's question regarding hurdles in producing a
gay webshow, stating that technical issues are particularly hard and seems
almost surprised when the presenter suggests that discrimination could be a
hurdle as well, since according to Arango, people have been very supportive of
this initiative.

They were also featured in _Version Beta_ , a show on a regional network also
available through streaming and fully online produced by
[Puntolink](http://puntolink.tv/) [es], who are very strong videobloggers
themselves with experience running [a webshow of their
own](http://todoloquehay.com/). In this episode of
[VersionBeta](http://livestre.am/HXaz) [es], the presenter shows how the
mentality towards sexual diversity might be changing for the better in
Colombia. As she [presents the Yonkis project](http://youtu.be/Yu-ace7Cn8M)
and leads into showing parts of the first episode, she warns parents about the
strong content they are about to watch: asking them not to cover their
children's eyes or ears, but rather to take the opportunity to talk to them
about sexual diversity.
