[Racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism) and discrimination is something
the USA still struggles with even today. This affects Native Americans
particularly hard, as it has in the past too. According to the last 2000
Census, almost [2,5 million Native Americans live in
USA](http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/race/indian.html) (0.87% of
total US population) but they are forgotten or invisible to the vast majority
of Americans.

On his blog _Stuff white people do_ , _macon d_ [publishes
excerpts](http://stuffwhitepeopledo.blogspot.com/2009/09/white-quotation-of-
week-shannon.html) from the 2006 book _[Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious
Habits of Racial Privilege](http://www.amazon.com/Revealing-Whiteness-
Unconscious-Privilege-Philosophy/dp/0253218489) _by philosophy professor
Shannon Sullivan, in order to underline the current justifications in the U.S.
toward ownership, not only of formerly indigenous lands, but also of
indigenous people themselves.

> Native American were and generally still are considered as pieces of
> property owned by white America to do with what they please, only now this
> “knowledge” of Native Americans by white people is much more unconscious
> than conscious. White habits of ownership of Native Americans generally have
> not been eliminated; they have only changed the form of their expression.
> Rather than something wild to consciously set out to conquer, Native
> Americans — especially their religious traditions and rituals — tend to be
> unconsciously appropriated as exotic objects for Euro-American use,
> pleasure, and consumption.

Dozens of comments follow, ranging from outrage about “genocide” against
Native Americans to “silent racism” by people who do not think of themselves
as racist, which according to another book, [_Silent Racism How Well-Meaning
White People Perpetuate the Racial Divide_](http://www.silentracism.com) by
sociology professor Barbara Trepagnier, becomes “instrumental in the
production of institutional racism” and part of the social process in today's
racial reality in the United States.

A commenter to the [above mentioned
post](http://stuffwhitepeopledo.blogspot.com/2009/09/white-quotation-of-week-
shannon.html), _Brother of another color_ writes:

In another comment, _Simon L'nu_ replies:

And another commenter, _Zelkova_ , adds:

In a similar vein, Kate from the group blog [_Irene's
Daughters_](http://irenesdaughters.wordpress.com/), belonging to three women
whose aim is to discuss race relations openly, addresses the common practise
of schools and sports teams to misappropriate Native Americans names, cultural
images and symbols as their mascots. In her post [“Racist
Mascots”](http://irenesdaughters.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/racist-mascots/),
she explains:

> American culture is brimming with mish-mashed, two-dimensional, demeaning,
> and offensive portrayals of Native Americans, and sports mascots are among
> the worst… These schools, sports teams, and their fans (not to mention the
> media and advertisers) are not respecting Indians as living, self-defining,
> and self-determining persons. Even when they do not employ repulsive
> epithets like “redskins” they are objectifying and dehumanizing Indians,
> appropriating and exploiting cultural and often sacred images for their own
> entertainment, propagating and perpetuating misinformed and humiliating
> stereotypes that damage both the way other people view Indians and the way
> Indians see themselves. (Studies have shown that Indian mascots are
> especially damaging to the self-esteem of Native American children.)

Kate also includes a link to a video aptly titled [“I am not a
mascot”](http://www.retirethechief.org/notamascot.html), where several Native
Americans voice their concerns and opposition to the use of Native American
imagery in sporting events.

This 3-minute video, released in different formats, is another evidence of the
increasing trend within Native American communities to use online citizen
media to fight racism and stereotypes, in much the same way that indigenous
communities elsewhere have used [ICTs to spread indigenous
knowledge](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/10/05/icts-and-the-spread-of-
indigenous-knowledge/) and educate the world about their traditions and
history.

Self-produced videos on racism in America by Native Americans [abound on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=native+americans+racism&search_type=&aq=f
). The following video, [“Racism against Native
Americans”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uATlOqN307k) produced by _[Red Road
Awareness](http://www.myspace.com/redroadawareness)_ , provides a concise
overview while highlighting the problem of racism on US radio shows, including
some disturbing on-air comments by a DJ in Kentucky.

The most viewed of such videos on YouTube, originally created in 1994, is
[“Racism the way we see it”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySSpLhM4-ls). It
describes how young Native Americans experience racism within their own
communities and in their daily involvements with the outside society.
