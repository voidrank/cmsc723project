One has to admire a person with the wits to keep a video camera turned on
while the ground is shaking beneath them. Citizen videos recorded Friday,
March 11 during the earthquake and tsunami that caused mass devastation in
many parts of Japan are all over YouTube. Among the many shared online, here
are just a few.

**The day of the big quake**

Staffers at a supermarket in Tokyo hold up the shelves during a quake that
lasted longer than a minute.

As the earthquake shakes a house, the people inside rush to the street.

These people watch a tsunami engulf Iioka Port in Chiba Prefecture from higher
ground.

At Shinjuku station in Tokyo, on March 11, these were people who couldn't get
home after the quake.

  
**Two days later**

After the quake, a man surveyed the damage in Iioka, Chiba Prefecture on March
13th and said: “It's like the wave passed through town.”
