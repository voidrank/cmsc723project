Last weekend saw an unprecedented event occur in the South Caucasus. _Flying
Carpets and Broken Pipelines_ blogger Arzu Geybullayeva, an Azerbaijani
citizen based in Istanbul, Turkey, and Baku, Azerbaijan, worked with _Global
Voices Online's_ Caucasus Editor Onnik Krikorian, a British citizen partly of
Armenian descent based in Yerevan, Armenia, to produce various reports on an
ethnic Azeri village situated close to Telavi, Georgia.

Although cross-border initiatives between journalists do occur, this
initiative was unusual because not only was it undertaken by mutual voluntary
consent, but it was also without the involvement of a “neutral” editor or
organization. It was certainly the first time that bloggers on both Armenia
and Azerbaijan, two countries in the South Caucasus still locked in a state of
war over the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh, came together.

As [detailed on my _Frontline Club_
blog](http://frontlineclub.com/blogs/onnikkrikorian/2009/09/an-unexpected-
visit-to-an-azeri-village-wedding.html), the collaboration was important for
both personal and professional reasons. Geybullayeva, also an [analyst on
Azerbaijan](http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&id=279&person_ID=11), was
perhaps the first English-language blog on her country to stand out in the
region.

> It was a dream come true. Despite knowing each other for several months
> online, the chances of meeting regional analyst and superstar blogger Arzu
> Geybullayeva seemed remote at best and unlikely at worst. […]
>
> […]

> But always expect the unexpected in the South Caucasus, and a meeting of
> youth activists inTelavi, Georgia, saw the unlikely happen. […]
>
> Ten minutes outside of Telavi was Karajala, a village Inhabited by
> approximately 8,000 ethnic Azeris in Georgia. As Arzu and I had often spoken
> about joint projects using traditional and new media to overcome the
> negative stereotypes of the other in play in Armenia and Azerbaijan, it
> provided us with the first of hopefully many projects along the same lines.
> What we weren't expecting, however, was to walk straight into an ethnic
> Azeri wedding.

Writing on her own blog and posting her own photos, Geybullayeva also
[remembers the visit to Karajala and especially stumbling upon the
wedding](http://flyingcarpetsandbrokenpipelines.blogspot.com/2009/10/trip-to-
georgia.html). She also details the history and context of the village in a
country where ethnic Azeris constitute the largest minority with an overall
population of around 280,000 according to a 2002 census.

> According to the locals the population of the village is around 8,000 people
> (Wikipedia says between 8 and 10,000). All are ethnic Azerbaijanis who have
> lived there for several generations. They speak in Azerbaijani but with a
> dialect- they all use Georgian as well, so it is more of a mix. 16- year-
> old son of the village head says there are maybe 3 or 4 Georgian families.
>
> […]
>
> To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I thought at best, there would be
> some nice shots and maybe few interviews. Well, it was more than that. 30
> minutes into the visit, a woman, whom we (me and journalist Onnik Krikorian)
> tried to interview told of a wedding that is taking place just five minutes
> from where we were standing.
>
> The front yard of the house was crowded with people- neighbors, relatives
> who came to help. This was just the preparation; the wedding was to take
> place later in the evening and that was the only the girl’s wedding
> (according to Azerbaijani traditions there are two weddings- girl and boy,
> the boy’s wedding is the actual wedding). It all looked like well- planned
> team work- men were setting up the tables, while women were busy preparing
> food and washing the dishes. 300 guests were expected to come.
>
> Several hours into chatting with locals, we got invited to the wedding
> itself, which was the ultimate experience.

A joint article and photostory will also soon be published by _[Osservatorio
Balcani e Caucaso](http://www.osservatoriocaucaso.org/)_ while a slide show of
my own photographs with an audio narrative from Geybullayeva can be viewed
above. So far response from Armenian and Azerbaijani alike as well as others
has been positive with some comments to that effect available on my _Frontline
Club_ post.

A larger version of the audio slideshow as well as a [video interview with
Arzu Geybullayeva on the visit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp16ru7lXoQ)
shot on a mobile phone is also available on the my _Frontline Club_ post as
well as below. Geybullayeva was also [interviewed by _Global Voices
Online_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/22/azerbaijan-an-interview-
with-arzu-geybullayeva/) in July. Hopefully this will mark the start of other
collaborations between Armenian and Azerbaijani bloggers in the months and
years to come.
