Early Wednesday morning, January 12, reports of a coup in Tunisia spread like
wildfire on Twitter. At approximately 5:10am CET, Wessim Amara
(@[wes_m](http://twitter.com/wes_am)) was amongst the first to
[tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/wes_am/status/25043256827969536):

"Phone confirmation that the army has surrounded the ministry of interior
#coup #tunisia #zaba"

Following the tweets of @wes_m and others, the Twitter stream became filled
with news of a rumored coup, and _The Next Web_ became amongst the first to
[report](http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2011/01/12/military-coup-in-tunisia-

on the possibility:

Along with the reports of a potential coup, a
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFTiCVnVs4) circulated on YouTube
showed massive protests in France outside of the Tunisian embassy there:

In the end, however, the reports of a coup were false; Nasser Weddady
(@[weddady](http://twitter.com/weddady)), whose report of a possible coup had
quickly become a Top Tweet, apologized,
[noting](http://twitter.com/#!/weddady/status/25057366101729280):

> Ok, I was wrong relying on @[SBZ_NEWS](http://twitter.com/SBZ_NEWS)on a coup

> [**#sidibouzid**](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sidibouzid
> "#sidibouzid") my mistake. No coup. Stay tuned.

As Emir Chouchane (@miroh_)
[concluded](http://twitter.com/#!/miroh_/status/25067861827391489):

> la rumeur d'un coup d'Etat d'aujourd'hui est la réponse de ce que veux
> vraiment le peuple.[
> **#sidibouzid**](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sidibouzid "#sidibouzid")

the rumor of a coup today is the answer to what people really want.
