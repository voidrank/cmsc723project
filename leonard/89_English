The petition of Singapore’s transport operators SMRT (train service) and SBS
(bus transit) for a fare increase has sparked a debate on the
[quality](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/07/public-transport-feedback-from-
singaporeans/) and future of the public transportation system in the
prosperous city state. The opposition Workers Party has proposed the creation
of a ‘non profit oriented’ [National Transport
Corporation](http://geraldgiam.sg/2011/07/overhauling-singapores-public-
transport-model/) to improve the bus and train operations in the city.

Gerald Giam of the Workers Party explains the
[advantages](http://geraldgiam.sg/2011/07/public-transport-fare-increases/) of
having a government-run transport system:

> The National Transport Corporation should not be profit-oriented but should
> aim to provide public transportation services on the basis of cost and
> depreciation recovery.
>
> Having a National Transport Corporation would not necessarily mean higher
> subsidies or a loss-making endeavour. If competently run, the Corporation
> could reduce costs associated with the duplication of functions and roles.
>
> We have seen many examples of efficiently run publicly-run service providers
> in Singapore in the past.

Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew is opposed to the nationalization of the
transport system but confirms the
[inefficiencies](http://www.facebook.com/notes/lui-tuck-yew/quality-of-
service-is-the-real-challenge/193666320691207) of the SMRT and SBS:

> Improving capacity, addressing crowdedness on buses and trains, frequency
> and reliability of service – these are among the key aspects. I have
> experienced the discomfort and frustrations that commuters faced because of
> the congestion and the sometimes unreliable service and I share your desire
> to see improvements to our public transport.

Lim Weiliang thinks that [lack of real
competition](http://thesatayclub.net/2011/07/just-how-much-profit-is-enough/)
prevents the SMRT and SBS from improving their services:

> With the monopoly structure in place, the operators have no incentive to
> improve their service standards – they merely need to do the bare minimum,
> while at the same time focusing on maximising their top and bottom lines.
> Apart from increasing fares, this can be done through advertising, which
> already accounts for a huge percentage of their operating revenues.

_Blogging for Myself_ believes that the SMRT and SBS management
[prioritizes](http://blogging4myself.blogspot.com/2011/07/public-transport-
debate-josephine-teo.html) their shareholders over commuters:

> My take is that we want the transport operators to put commuters as their
> number one priority. Problem is they operate under a structure where
> shareholders’ and management interests rank ahead of commuters. As long as
> you stick with these priorities, commuters would be short changed.

_The Thinking Fish Tank_ offers a solution: make all Singaporeans SMRT and SBS
[shareholders](http://thethinkingfishtank.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/on-fare-
increases-%E2%80%93-how-we-can-avoid-them-discreetly/):

> Commuters want better service and lower fares while operators want higher
> revenue and lower cost, both of which are easily achieved at the expense of
> the commuters in a non-competitive oligopoly market structure. Yet, to align
> the incentives of operators to commuters by nationalizing public transport
> may prove to be a costly and futile endeavor. Thus, I propose the simple
> solution of aligning the interests of commuters to that of operators by
> making all Singaporeans SMRT and SBS shareholders! That way, commuters can
> stand to benefit from fare increases in the form of dividends paid each
> year. Consequently, this will make fare increases more palatable in the
> future.

R Ganesh of _The Satay Club_ dissects the
[problems](http://thesatayclub.net/2011/07/time-to-shake-up-the-glc-
monopolies/) of the public transport system:

> The current situation with regards to public transport – as well as certain
> other industries in Singapore – brings us the worst of both worlds. It
> combines the downsides of nationalisation (inefficiency, no incentive to
> improve service, no incentive to lower costs) with the downsides of
> privatisation (profiteering, attempting to reduce consumer surplus, focus on
> bottom line above all else).

_Desparatebeep_ is [not
supportive](http://desparatebeep.blogspot.com/2011/07/great-transport-debate-
to-nowhere.html) of the proposed nationalization of the transport system:

> What can be done be done about this? Well, let’s start with the realisation
> that governments are good at doing certain things and businesses are good
> others. These two don’t exactly compliment each other and the skill sets
> required to be good at the government things are not the same skills that
> are needed to be good at the business things.
>
> Competition has been proven to be a good thing and the last thing we need in
> Singapore is more government. Let’s work towards separating government and
> business and create a better Singapore.
