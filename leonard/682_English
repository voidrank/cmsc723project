bon-secours-baltimore-health-system.php)Four Filipina staffers of the _Bon
Secours Baltimore Health System_ in Baltimore City were recently [fired from
their jobs](http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/06/22/10/4-pinoys-lose-
us-jobs-speaking-tagalog) for speaking Filipino during their lunch break.
Bloggers share their views on the issue.

The _angry asian man_ believes that the hospital's English-only policy is [an
injustice](http://blog.angryasianman.com/2010/06/filipino-nurses-fired-for-
speaking.html).

> I can understand a rule like this in trauma situations, where there are
> obvious concerns about communication. But the Bon Secours policy sounds way
> too broad, without clear guidelines to be fairly implemented or followed
> without incident. So you utter a non-English word on your snack break and
> you're fired? Just like that?
>
> These employees weren't even properly informed or given documentation about
> the alleged violations. What did they say? What was the context? Nobody has
> any idea. The Virginia-based Migrant Heritage Commission has filed a
> complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of
> the fired nurses.

_Adarna's Attic_ [sees](http://adarnasattic.blogspot.com/2010/07/overseas-
filipino-nurses-ailing-healers.html) the summary termination of the four
Filipino workers as a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, “a US federal
law that protects individuals from discrimination based on race, origin or
social standing.”

Jose Manuel's _Blog of Life_ is [struck
](http://martilyo.blogspot.com/2010/07/filipina-nurses-in-baltimore-
maryland.html)that the firing “happened in the middle of a supposed “‘nursing
shortage.'”

> If these nurses are such a scarce commodity so treasured, why were they
> fired so quickly? One wonders why new nursing graduates have trouble finding
> jobs. The Wife’s cousin had a business recruiting nurses in the Philippines,
> but she shut it down as hospitals no longer needed her services. Perhaps the
> medical industry is trying to increase the supply of nurses in order to hold
> down the cost of nurses wages. If so, that’s bad news for the fired nurses.

Meanwhile, Sarah Katrina Maramag [takes a comprehensive look
into](http://thepoc.net/thepoc-features/politi-ko/politiko-
features/8547-overseas-filipino-nurses-ailing-healers.html) the plight of
overseas Filipino nurses and link this to the larger picture of the continuing
exodus of Filipino professionals from the Philippines.
