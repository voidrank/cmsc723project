Cyber citizenship, blogging and courageous citizen photo-bloggers were a
corner stone of this international artistic movement.  
John Wyszniewski, Assistant Director of Communication at the School of Visul
Arts in New York said to Global Voices by email:

> Following the elections in Iran in the summer of 2009, an Iranian
> photographer who goes by the name of Green Bird urged graphic artists from
> all over the world to create posters in support the Green Movement in Iran.
> One of the artists he approached, Italian designer Andrea Rauch, volunteered
> to host all of the posters on the web site
> [SocialDesignZine](http://sdz.aiap.it/home.php), the blog of the Association
> of Italian Graphic Designers, where Rauch serves as editor. Over 200 posters
> have been collected on the site and can be viewed.

Wyszniewski shares a text from one of Green Bird's emails:

> And here is the text from one of Green Bird's original emails:  
>  “How are you,my friend? I hope you are fine.I am so sad in these days.many
> people died in Iran(after Iran election).the boys and girls killed in last
> days.my tears go by.the present issue in Iran is an international one.And in
> my opinion the well-known artists of the world should join the cause.you are
> a Great Illustrator.I urgently ask you to design a poster in support of this
> cause.you are an Iranian in these days like me.you are like me then help me
> in this way (Green Movement).”

Green Bird in her emails [shared ](http://sdz.aiap.it/gallerie/11536)his/her
photos from Iranian protests with the outside world too.

Wyszniewski at the end says the main topics symbolizing ‘Green art’ are:
“Unity, Desire for Freedom, Betrayal, Hope.”
