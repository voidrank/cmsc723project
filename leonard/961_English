Hundreds of Iranian men have dressed as women in Hijab to support [Majid
Tavakoli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majid_Tavakoli), a student activist who
was arrested on December 7, and express solidarity with women. Iranian
authorities [claim](http://www.nowpublic.com/world/majid-tavakoli-arrested-
iran-government-says-womens-dress-2535879.html) Mr. Tavakoli was dressed as a
woman to escape after delivering a speech in Tehran on [Student
Day](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/07/iran-student-day-demonstraion-
in-you-tube/).

However, human rights activists in Iran have
[published](http://www.nowpublic.com/world/majid-tavakoli-arrested-iran-
government-says-womens-dress-2535879.html) a report from an eyewitness saying:
“All the pictures published by the state media are false and a clear use of
immoral means against student and civil activists in Iran.”

Hundreds of Iranian men are now dressed as women in their FaceBook profiles.
Here is a YouTube video in support of Majid that has collected some of these
photos (begins after 42 seconds).
