Five out of 30 Mozambican students enrolled at the African International
University in Sudan with scholarships have returned to their home country. In
April 2012, they signed and shared a
[complaint](http://pda.verdade.co.mz/vozes/37-hora-da-verdade/26876-carta-dos-
estudantes-mocambicanos-na-universidade-internacional-de-africa-no-sudao) [pt]
on social media regarding the social and financial difficulties they were
facing in Sudan.

In the letter,
[published](http://www.facebook.com/mocambicanos.sudao/posts/260017114094203)
[pt] on April 27 on the Facebook profile ‘Moçambicanos no Sudão’ (Mozambicans
in Sudan), the students – sent abroad by Muslim charity organizations –
requested their government's intervention for the resolution of a situation
perceived as “extremely chaotic”:

> falta de fundos para pagamento de vistos de estadia, propinas, material
> escolar, material de higiene individual, seguro de saúde, e não deixando de
> lado a falta da variação alimentar, visto que os estudantes têm único tipo
> de alimentação de um de Janeiro a trinta e um de Dezembro de cada ano, Arroz
> e um caril muito esquisito (batata doce e abóbora).

Lack of funds to pay for visa permits, enrollment fees, school supplies,
supplies for personal hygiene, health insurance, and not to mention the
absence of a diversified menu, as students have had the same meal from January
1 to December 31, each year: rice and a very weird relish (made of sweet
potato and pumpkin).

The students's complaint generated a
[stir](http://www.rm.co.mz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1759:estudantes-
no-sudao-denunciam-qprecarias-condicoesq-de-vida&catid=1:ultimas&Itemid=50)
[pt] in Mozambique's national press and social media, which made the
University urge the students to write [a new
document](http://www.rm.co.mz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2534:seis-
dos-45-estudantes-mocambicanos-no-sudao-com-documentos-
confiscados&catid=71:recomendado&Itemid=199) [pt], denying their previous
statements.

The students, who refused to give into Sudanese pressure, were expelled from
the University and sent back to Mozambique on June 29.

After seven hours at Maputo's International Airport with nowhere to go, the
students were welcomed and lodged by the Youth Parliament (PJ), a non-
governmental organization which became their most [visible supporting
figure](https://twitter.com/verdademz/status/218466144221278208) [pt]. During
a press conference at the Youth Parliament headquarters, the students spoke
about the conditions they had faced and a possible connection to Al-Qaeda in
Sudan.

Social media was full of criticism regarding the government of Mozambique and
its distant attitude to the issue. Minister of Education [Zeferino
Martins](http://www.rm.co.mz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2219:governo-
distancia-se-de-bolseiros-mocambicanos-no-sudao-&catid=104:africa-
austral&Itemid=374) [pt] stated the government “has no responsibility towards
scholarship holders studying in Sudan, since those young Mozambican citizens
went abroad financed by Muslim organizations to pursue religious education.”

Students go to Sudan intermediated by individuals linked to Muslim religious
organizations based in Mozambique, mainly in the capital Maputo.
[According](http://www.rm.co.mz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2219:governo-
distancia-se-de-bolseiros-mocambicanos-no-sudao-&catid=104:africa-
austral&Itemid=374) [pt] to the Ministry of Education, the students in
question received symbolic support from the [Sautul
Islam](http://www.sautulisslam.com/) organization.

Despite the minister's statement, the ‘Liga das ONGs de Moçambique’ (League of
NGOs of Mozambique) [published](http://www.joint.org.mz/joint2/?p=1585) [pt] a
note saying that the government should have taken a stand:

> Admitindo que, eventualmente, os estudantes sejam vítimas das medidas de
> contenção de custos, seria importante [o Governo] ter um diálogo com eles e
> ajudá-los no desenho de cenários que possam mitigar o sofrimento dos
> estudantes.

If the students are eventually victims of measures to constrain costs, it is
important for the government to establish a dialogue and help them come up
with solutions to alleviate the students’ suffering.

And adds:

> esta situação pode chamar a atenção para mudança ou revisão das políticas
> públicas com relação a atribuição das bolsas e as respectivas condições dai
> subjacentes.

This situation draws attention for the need to change or revise public
policies related to awarding scholarships and the conditions scholarship
holders may later face.

Similar cases have occured before, as [pointed

anonimously by a Mozambican student in Vietnam in a comment to the article on
@Verdade Newspaper. He deplores the “situation of students in Sudan, Algeria
and Russia”.

[pt] in another article:

Scholarship holders in Algeria demanded what they were promised (and they were
sent back home). These ones in Sudan are probably the poorest among the poor,
and the Ministry of Education says it's not their business, it's about the
muslim organizations (the “madrassas”). In civilized countries, when they
agree to cooperate in education, they act accordingly. But apparently in this
case nobody will take responsibility.
