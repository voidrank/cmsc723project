I’d like to congratulate Grisha Asmolov and Alexey Sidorenko from Global
Voice's [RuNet Echo](https://globalvoicesonline.org/-/special/runet-echo/)
project for receiving a [RuNet Award](http://www.premiaruneta.ru/) [ru] for
their project “Help Map” ([Russian-fires.ru](http://russian-fires.ru/)). It's
wonderful to report that members of the GV community have received the most
prestigious award in the Russian Internet. Even more exciting, Grisha and
Alexey won it in the “State and Society” category, beating out a wide range of
other important [laureates](http://www.premiaruneta.ru/laureates/2010/) [ru].

“Help Map” is a project to crowdsource and map unprecedented wildfires outside
of Moscow in summer 2010. The project quickly became an important base for
volunteers to provide resources and lend a hand during weeks of crisis. Global
Voices articles covering the “Help Map” can be found in Global Voices’
[Russian Wildfires 2010](../specialcoverage/russia-wildfires-2010/) special
coverage, from August-September 2010.

“Help Map” was the first deployment of the [Ushahidi](http://ushahidi.com/)
platform in Russia and one of the more successful in Ushahidi's history.
Together with other centers of aid coordination, “Help Map” was an inspiring
example of online activism providing an offline change. It also demonstrated
that Russian citizens will [engage](../2010/08/30/russia-online-cooperation-
as-an-alternative-for-government/) in civic participation when given a real
opportunity to make a difference – an idea that's counter to common
perceptions of Russian civic engagement as cynical and passive. As Gregory
Asmolov [says](../2010/08/30/russia-online-cooperation-as-an-alternative-for-
government/):

> The activity of the Russian online community wasn't limited to helping
> wildfire victims. Bloggers created units of volunteer firefighters, went
> into the field and eventually provided immediate response. Along with the
> comprehensive instructions on how to become a firefighter, how to fight
> various types of wildfires, and what equipment volunteers should have, the
> Internet provided a platform for 24-hour coordination and exchange of
> information about the rapidly changing situation.

[comments](http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/12/01/internet-oscar/) on
Russian citizen engagement:

> The “Help Map” demonstrated that Russian network society is not a passive
> audience, but it has an active core with high degree of social
> accountability…the “Help Map” participation and achievement is a symbolic

The “Runet Award” is sponsored by Russian Federal Agency of Mass
Communications. It is the national award granted for significant contribution
to the Russian Internet's development and is known as the Russia “Internet
Oscar.” The Runet Award ceremony is broadcast on Russian state TV, and can be
found online on the Russian news channel
[Vesti](http://www.vesti.ru/videos?vid=308768&cid=1). Congratulations Grisha
and Alex!
