Alternative media is taking important steps in Costa Rica. The Pío Viquez
National Award for Journalism was granted this year to Cristian Cambronero for
his achievements in alternative journalism. Cristian has been publishing in
his blog [_Fusil de Chispas [es]_](http://www.fusildechispas.com) since 2005
encouraging the participation of readers on topics from politics and social
media, to culture and music among others. He also had actively participated
and promoted activities such as the [First International Encounter of Citizen
Journalism [es]](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/04/costa-rica-citizen-
journalism-has-yet-to-reach-its-full-potential) and similar initiatives, which
its main objective is the enhancement of technology with traditional
broadcast.

The[ National Culture Awards [es]](http://www.mcjdcr.go.cr/premios/) have been
celebrated since 1961 by the Ministry of Culture. They look to recognize the
efforts and accomplishments that people, groups and organizations make in Art,
Science, Popular Traditional Culture and Journalism. This is the first time
that digital media has been taken into account as part of the nominations.

The good news was quickly spread through social networks and twitter. Some
bloggers were inspired by the announcement of a colleague receiving such an
important honor. Alberto González [points out in his
blog](http://www.porescrito.net/2010/01/18/premio-fusildechispas) _Por Escrito
[es]_ :

> Internet ha venido sacudiendo los cimientos de los medios de comunicación
> tradicionales desde su incepción, y a través del periodismo del Fusil
> podemos ver los signos de ese cambio inexorable: Un periodismo
> participativo, subjetivo.

Internet has been shaking the foundations of traditional communication media
and through Fusil's journalism we can observe this relentless change: a
participative, subjective journalism.

Luis Diego Molina [writes on](http://hablacostarica.com/el-premio-a-un-blog-
con-excelencia) _Habla Costa Rica [es]_ :

> Esto recalca la importancia que la web y los medios ciudadanos están
> alcanzando en nuestro país y en la formación de una opinión pública más
> democrática.

It makes an statement on the importance that the web and citizen media are
having in our country and in the formation of a more democratic public
opinion.

Julia Ardón [expresses her feelings towards the announcement
[es]](http://www.juliaardon.com/2010/01/y-el-premio-nacional-de-periodismo-es-
para-un-blog/):

> Su blog ha sido una de las más frescas contribuciones al ambiente de la
> comunicación en Costa Rica. Un trabajo, donde, como él mismo lo dice “La
> Pasión va primero”

His blog has been one of the more refreshing contributions to the environment
of communication that Costa Rica has had. A piece of work where, as he says,
passion comes first.

Cristian leaves[ a thankful note](http://www.fusildechispas.com/2010/01/toma-
esto-messi) in his blog _Fusil de Chispas [es]_ :

> De momento lo realmente claro es que la naturaleza misma de un blog lo haría
> perder su esencia si fuera unidireccional. Es la participación lo que ha
> hecho que el Fusil funcione, y sirva para algo. El más honesto
> agradecimiento para todos los que pasan por aquí.

Right now, it is really clear that a blog's nature could lose its essence if
it only works unidirectionally. Participation is what makes the Fusil valuable
and functional. My honest gratitude to everyone that stops by here.
