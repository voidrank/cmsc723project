Fear, chaos, hysteria and despair – all these words have been used to describe
Libyan capital Tripoli's airport over the past few days. Since [uprisings
began](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/21/voices-from-libya-its-a-
massacre-audio/) against the country's leader Colonel Muammar Al Gaddafi on
the night of February 16, 2011
([#Feb17](https://twitter.com/search/feb17#search?q=feb17)), Libya has been in
a state of uncertainty.

Thousands of foreign nationals, mostly expat workers, have been trying to flee
the country, gathering in Tripoli airport to catch embassy and some airline
flights out.

This video from [Al Jazeera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs1p_Ux7pdI)
describes the chaos that passengers at the airport are experiencing:

**Crimes Reported**

Frustrated and frightened passengers are apparently not only being faced with
the uncertainty of leaving, but also with various forms of crimes that have
been reported at the airport. From 24 February, 2011:

> [@Matchbox20](http://twitter.com/Matchbox20/status/40829548560007168) #Libya
> policemen r blackmailing #Egyptians & taking their money at #Tripoli airport

detailed the new costs fleeing foreigners are facing on Facebook:

> LIBYA – ” Signs of the decay and the end of regimes that I've seen elsewhere
> is happening now. People are asking for bribes. If you want to do anything
> in the airport, it will cost you. A $20 taxi ride to Tripoli airport now

And from 25 February, 2011:

**Challenging Journeys**

Some airlines and companies undertaking the evacuation of their employees have
been reported as behaving poorly towards passengers; other passengers feel let
down by the way their governments have managed the situation:

> [@ks1141](http://twitter.com/ks1141/status/41019053434875905) Egypt Air in
> Tripoli bumped off pregnant Asian woman even tho she has a valid business
> class ticket! Still stuck at airport in Tripoli. [24 February]

Some have avoided the airport entirely by fleeing Libya via its neighbouring
countries:

Any information about new incoming planes offers fresh hope to those stranded
at the airport. One of the most important sources of information is the
website [RadarVirtuel.com](http://www.radarvirtuel.com/) that makes available
online real-time aircraft traffic coverage. The website provides key details
about the flight, the current position of aircraft in the air, time of
departure and arrival time, and initial and final destination:
