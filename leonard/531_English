Despite [an ongoing re-
examination](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/07/01/usa-indigenous-rights-
declaration-under-reexamination/) of [the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous
Peoples](http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/declaration.html), the United
States now finds itself as the only country to have voted against the 2007
document. That's because Canada, as
[Australia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/04/04/australia-indigenous-
rights-declaration-approved/) and [New
Zealand](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/07/01/usa-indigenous-rights-
declaration-under-reexamination/) earlier, has unexpectedly made a u-turn and
decided to adopt the Declaration.

_[Human Rights Now](http://blog.amnestyusa.org/women/canada-endorses-the-un-
declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples/)_ , the blog of Amnesty
International USA, has a post by staff member Angela T. Chang on Canada's
action:

> On November 12th, Canada joined the majority of the world in supporting the
> United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The
> Declaration is a non-legally binding human rights instrument which affirms
> universal standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of all
> Indigenous Peoples.
>
> […]
>
> It is past-due time for the United States to endorse the UNDRIP. Unqualified
> support for the Declaration is fundamental to ensuring that the United
> States follows international human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples,
> who are among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable peoples in the world. In
> the United States, nearly 24% of indigenous people live in poverty.

Chang asks her readers to [send a message to Barack
Obama](http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/siteapps/advocacy/index.aspx?c=jhKPIXPCIoE&b=2590179&template=x.ascx&action=14586)
urging endorsement of the Declaration.

Not everyone is happy with Canada's endorsement, however. Pam Palmater a
Toronto lawyer and professor, writing on the blog _[Non-Status
Indians](http://nonstatusindian.blogspot.com/2010/11/illusion-of-justice-in-
canada.html)_ , defending the rights of those who are not officially
recognized as Indians, calls the news “The Illusion of Justice in Canada”:

> I would like to think that Canada has moved past some of its double-dealings
> of the past, but this limited endorsement of UNDRIP by the Conservatives
> proves otherwise. From one side of their face they promise to make changes
> to address our issues and from the other side, they rally public support
> against us and find creative political spin to keep from acting on their
> promises. Canada did not truly, in letter and spirit, endorse UNDRIP – they
> issued a “Statement of Support” that does not change Indigenous rights (or
> lack thereof) in Canada.
