The Spanish 15 m movement that took [thousands to the
streets](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/17/spain-thousands-of-
citizens-take-the-streets/) to demand a more democratic system has reached a
new stage. The authorities decided on August 2 not to allow demonstrations any
more and they have since tried to prevent demonstrators from gathering, both
through blocking their access to public spaces and through violent police
action.

On August 4, a gathering was organized at Madrid's main square Puerta del Sol,
the epicenter of the protests, but access to the square has been restricted
since August 2. The underground and the commuter train, which normally stop at
Puerta del Sol, were ordered not to stop there that day and heavy police
presence was displayed to ensure that the 15 m movement would not gather
there. Twitter was suddenly flooded with reactions like this:

> [@alberarce](https://twitter.com/#!/alberarce) Dice
> [@RTVE](https://twitter.com/#!/RTVE) “indignados buscan la manera de llegar
> a la Puerta del Sol, defendida por la policía”¿defendida de qué?
> #plazatomada #periodismo

@alberarce Spanish TV says “demonstrators are trying to reach Sol, which is
defended by the Police.” “Defended” from what? #plazatomada #periodismo

The tension increased during that day and the following day, when
demonstrators gathered at Paseo de la Castellana, Madrid. The police presence
was heavy, and it ended with policemen charging against demonstrators. This
video, which has been widely shared online, shows journalist Gorka Ramos (who
works for Spanish news-site _[La Información](http://www.lainformacion.com/)_
) being addressed by the police while he was tweeting the events, and beaten
right after (min 8). According to the Police, Ramos was arrested for insulting
and spitting on the police agents.

Reactions to Ramos's detention have ignited through social media, especially
Twitter, where #periodistadetenido (journalist arrested) became a trending
topic.

@mtasco To get the government disturbed all you have to do is tweet form a

While the detention was not covered by most Spanish media, it received
[coverage from international
media](http://233grados.lainformacion.com/blog/2011/08/reacciones-medios-
internacionales-detencion-gorka-ramos.html) like _The Guardian_ , _CBS_ ,
_Forbes_ and _Associated Press_.

Renowned blogger La Pulga y la Locomotora shared [an open letter
](http://lapulgaylalocomotora.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/carta-abierta-a-la-
delegacion-del-gobierno-de-madrid/)[es] on August 5 asking the Spain
Government for the reasons behind this unprecedented step in order to stop
mobilizations:

> Supongo que son conscientes de que se están vulnerando ciertos derechos
> fundamentales de los ciudadanos, el más evidente el de Libre Circulación,
> pero también el de Reunión y el derecho a la Libertad de Expresión.

I suppose you are aware that fundamental rights are being violated, including
the right to free circulation, reunion and freedom of speech. Have you
considered the legal aspects?

The letter also mentions what many citizens consider to be the real reason for
the movement restrictions and police presence:

> Veo bastante más relación con la próxima visita del Papa Benedicto, la
> verdad, y debería preguntarle sobre ello, pero sé que un estado laico nunca
> aceptará públicamente el hecho de que está actuando bajo petición de la
> Iglesia Católica.

It seems more related to the upcoming visit of the Pope (who will be joining
members of the Catholic Youth in Madrid) and I'd like you to confirm this,
although I know that a lay state would never publicly admit to be acting under
petition of the Catholic Church.

Some users have expressed concern about what they consider an attempt to use
the current events to divide citizens. According to blogger[ Alberto
Vizcaíno](http://www.alvizlo.es/blog/2011/08/15-m-en-la-encrucijada/) [es]:

> El poder lo sabe y empieza a gestionar el 15 M: enfrentando ciudadanos
> contra ciudadanos. Ya tenemos a partidos llamando a la división: “católicos
> contra indignados”. Como si fuese incompatible ser católico o militar en un
> partido con estar indignado y querer mejorar el sistema en el que vivimos.

They now know how to manage the 15 m movement. Making citizens confront each
other. We already have political parties highlightling this division:
“indignant vs. catholic”. As if being a Catholic and wanting to improve the
system we live in were incompatible.

The Government delegation (formed by the ruling Spanish Socialist Worker's
Party known as the PSOE in Spanish) [confirmed
recently](http://www.publico.es/espana/390255/la-policia-se-retira-de-la-
puerta-del-sol-y-ya-no-corta-los-accesos) [es] that they were being pressured
by Madrid's City Council (controlled by right-wing People Party) into stopping
protesters from occupying public spaces during the Pope's visit. On August 5,
the authorities seemed to have changed their mind. [The Police
withdrew](http://www.publico.es/espana/390255/la-policia-se-retira-de-la-
puerta-del-sol-y-ya-no-corta-los-accesos) [es] from Sol and access
restrictions were removed. With demonstrators more indignant now than ever,
the story will very likely be continued.
