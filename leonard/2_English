Graffiti is an art that can be labelled under civil disobedience and peaceful
expression. Although the [Syrian
Revolution](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/syria-
protest-2011/) has intrinsic humanitarian values; it is a revolution with
artistic aspects. Painting is one of the most important methods a human uses
to express one's ideas; it is the fastest way to illustrate an idea or to make
people interact with this idea.

To give the graffiti its real power, let's remember the spark that lit the
Syrian revolt flame. A famous Graffiti in
[Daraa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa) in 2011 led to the arrests of at
least 15 children for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a
school. And so, the local governor decided to come down hard. The punishment
stunned the town, and suddenly, Syria got its first strong taste of rebellion
in the [Arab Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring).

Graffiti has became another field of the conflict, where both government and
peaceful activists found their freedom of expression. According to [Al-
akhbar](http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/999):

> Syrian authorities and graffiti dissidents are playing cat and mouse on the
> country’s walls. Syrian protesters spray anti-regime slogans, while
> authorities rush to cover them up and arrest the perpetrators, including one
> mysterious dissident dubbed Spray Man. When buying spray paint in Syria,
> remember to take your ID with you. Vendors refuse to sell the paint unless
> buyers provide personal papers and an ‘affidavit’ explaining the reasons
> behind the purchase.

Graffiti also finds a life on the Internet. For instance, Syrian activists
created a group called “اسبوع غرافيتي الحريـّة سوريا – [Freedom Graffiti
Week](https://www.facebook.com/MAD.GRAFFiTi.Week.SYRiaa)“.

**Graffiti: Walls of the People**

In March 2011, Syrians went to the streets to express their rage, which filled
the streets of Syria's cities with thousands of protesters chanting for
freedom. Meanwhile, others found their voice on walls. You can spread your
message in different ways. On the streets, you can shout, dance, sing; while
on the walls you can paint, write, and personalize characters. Messages
between pro and anti Assad factions were expressed, corrected, and painted
over many times in a way showing that both sides are sharing the same space.

**Pro & Anti Syrian Revolution Graffiti**

Happy Arab news service blog
[reported](http://happyarabnewsservice.blogspot.com.br/2011/04/pro-anti-
syrian-revolution-graffiti-in.html) that graffiti was seen at an anti-Assad
insurance agent's business in the United States. A day later, a pro-Assad
journalist posted a photo on Facebook of pro-revolution graffiti on a Garden
Grove travel agency owned by a Syrian-American who expressed support to the
current regime.

> Orange County's Syrian-Americans are divided over the revolution in Syria.
> We've seen protests in front of Syria's consulate in Newport Beach, some
> against the regime and others to support it. Recently, the divide in
> Southern California has escalated.

There is a saying in Syria goes: “الحيطان دفاتر المجانين” which means “Wall
are the sheets of the insane people”; however, nowadays Syrian people turn
Syria's walls into the free expression exchange field!

I'll leave you with some painted walls in several cities in Syria.
