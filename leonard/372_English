A Vietnamese engineer named Pham Thanh Son apparently set himself afire to
protest the confiscation of his family’s property by local authorities.

According to the blog [Danlambao](http://danlambao1.wordpress.com/) (which
means citizen journalists), Son's self-immolation occurred on February 17 at
12:30pm outside the municipal offices of Vietnam’s fifth largest city. Son
visited the People’s Committee of [Da
Nang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang) earlier in the day to petition his
case. When authorities refused to hear his appeal, the young engineer set fire
to himself and his motorcycle on the sidewalk outside.

Police initially indicated that Son’s death was a routine traffic accident.
Authorities also described Son as a person with “mental problems.”

Meanwhile, authorities reportedly posted plainclothes police outside [Son’s
family
residence](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=737+Ng%C3%B4+Quy%E1%BB%81n,+da+nang,+vietnam&sll=38.899805,-77.05299&sspn=0.009886,0.018775&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Ng%C3%B4+Quy%E1%BB%81n,+Da+Nang,+Vietnam&ll=16.056536,108.23679&spn=0.097659,0.150204&z=13)
and limited the family’s ability to receive visitors.

Danlambao reports:

Da Nang, located along Vietnam’s central coast, is in the midst of a major
construction boom. Initiated in 2009, [Cau
Rong](http://danlambao1.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/410029.jpg) is a 667-meter
long bridge currently being built over the Han river. Municipal authorities
claimed to have adequately compensated and resettled local residents.

In recent years, many farmers and urban residents in Da Nang and throughout
Vietnam have complained about [land
seizures](http://www.usingmedia.com/vietnam/displaced.html) and organized
small protest movements.
