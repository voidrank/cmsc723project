First there was planking or the lying down game which became an instant hit in
Thailand. [Celebrities](http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/242899/),
[protesters](http://suthichaiyoon.blogspot.com/2011/06/red-shirts-go-planking-
at-ratchaprasong.html), and
[politicians](http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/242741/chuwit-pulls-off-
a-plank) have gamely uploaded their planking photos. The _Bangkok Planking
Community_ Facebook [page](http://www.facebook.com/bkkplank?sk=wall) was
established which allowed ordinary people to post their planking photos from
unusual places.

But this planking photo of a person dressed in a monk robe stirred a heated
online debate. There is even a cash reward for anyone who would be able to
identify the person.

The [Culture Watch
Centre](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/06/21/national/Nude-planking-
photos-online-an-offence-30158300.html) has also declared nude planking as
‘inappropriate.’ Saksith Saiyasombut
[rejects](http://asiancorrespondent.com/57921/thailands-cultural-heralds-to-
crackdown-on-planking/) this position

> Well, well – “inappropriate”, again! Of course such a thing is not meant to
> be ‘constructive’, it’s a nonsensical gag just for laughs or ‘for the lolz’,
> as the kids today might say it.

> Instead of just keeping quiet and wait until it fades out (and today’s

> appropriate. Just ‘go with the lulz’ for once!

But planking was immediately overshadowed by a bigger craze: [Pub
Peab](http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/play/thailand-embraces-planking-and-gives-
it-twist-592652). It’s called planking with a Thai twist that involves sitting
in a kneeling position.

Its Facebook [page](http://www.facebook.com/pubpeab) has more than 200,339
likes. It also has a [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/Pubpeab_Th) account.

Even authorities are
[supportive](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/06/21/national/Planking-
with-a-Thai-slant-30158356.html) of the ‘Pub Peab’ craze because of its
positive promotion of Thai culture.
