The [Ahmadiyah](http://www.multibrand.biz/2011/02/whats-wrong-with-
ahmadiyah.html) followers in Indonesia have been experiencing a series of
prosecutions in the country. In 2008, the government issued a decree
recognizing their existence but disallowed the group from spreading their
teachings. Since then, the members have been attacked in public places by
thugs and religious fanatics. However, the culprits of the previous incidents
were never arrested by the police.

The latest incident took place about eight days ago, when a mob of more than
1,500 people attacked an Ahmadi congregation in Cikeusik Sub District. While
the elderlies, women and children were able to flee the congregation house,
the Ahmadi men were attacked by a mob screaming “God is great”. The mob used
stones and machetes. Three of of the Ahmadis died, while few others were badly
injured, reports said that the victims’ bodies were later on hanged on trees.

A group of Human Rights NGOs including Kontras managed to obtain a lengthy
video recording of the incident. Some parts of the video were uploaded on
Youtube. The NGOs also claimed that the police didn't perform their duty by
allowing the attack to continue despite their presence in the area

Marjuki Alie on his _Politikana_ blog
[post](http://politikana.com/baca/2011/02/08/pembunuh-ahmadiyah-tidak-
bersalah.html) said that the Ahmadi murderers are not the ones to blame.

Indonesian laws are weak, easy to be bought, easy to be pressurized by parties
who are protecting their interests. […] How come the murderers are innocent,
where's the logic in that? Those who gang up against the victims and those who
committed murder have lost their minds. How did they lose their minds? They
were taught that what they're doing is righteous. They were taught that what
they do is for religious sake and to defend that religion is noble.

Enraged Twitter users share their opinions:

Even if Ahmadiyyah is a deviant teaching, they're not supposed to be treated
unjustly.

The Ahmadi murderers didn't realize that our country is not a Muslim country
but based on Pancasila.  
Why organizations such as FPI ( _author's note_ : Islamic Defenders Front, a
Muslim hardline organization, secretly nicknamed “the cloaked thugs”, known
for bashing bars and massage parlors) only protested when terrorists received
death penalty? But went silent, when there's an Ahmadi being murdered?

The state lies about guaranteeing the harmony of the interfaith believers, as
it lies about corruption eradication

**Temanggung riot  
**  
A couple of days after the Cikeusik incident, a riot occured on Temanggung,
Central Java. Under the Anti Blasphemy law, Antonius Richmond Bawengan
received 5 year for desecrating Islam and Christianity. Later that day, a mob
of 1,000 men arrived from other cities and began to destroy Churches and a
Christian school in Temanggung.
