Since February 2, 2011, [Colombian truck drivers ](<a
href="http://www.rcnradio.com/noticias/05-02-11/camioneros-rechazan-llamado-
del-gobierno-y-mantienen-paro-nacional">camioneros colombianos</a>)[es] have
been on national strike due to government reforms that aim to remove the table
of cargo charges that, according to the internet news site _[La silla
vacía](http://www.lasillavacia.com/elblogueo/blogoeconomia/21146/por-que-si-
hay-que-eliminar-la-tabla-de-fletes) _[es](The Empty Chair), “regulates, since
1997, the minimum prices of the transportation of cargo in the country.”

The Vice President of the Colombian Association of Truck Drivers (ACC), Pablo
Mogollón, [explains
that](http://www.laopinion.com.co/noticias/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=366824&Itemid=32)
[es] “it is a government measure for the country to increase its
competitiveness at the expense of the incomes of the haulers, because without
the table of cargo charges the manufacturers will pay whatever they want to
pay them and whenever they want.”

Thus, since the start of February there has been a partial reduction of cargo
mobility throughout the country, which has gradually become more noticeable
due to the increase in the number of workers of this profession, who have
decided to locate themselves, with their trucks, at different places on the
Colombian road network.

On February 15, the issue became one of the most mentioned in traditional and
citizen media, because of various reports of traffic congestion in the
capital, [Bogotá](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogota), caused by a
significant number of truck drivers who decided to immobilize their vehicles,
parking them in various important streets, especially in the west of the city.

On Twitter, with the hashtag
[#parocamionero](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23parocamionero) [es]
(#truckdriverstrike), opinions are divided between those who support the
demonstration by this group of workers and those who criticize them for
creating chaos and affecting the mobility in the city.

I am with the truckers. It is logical and reasonable to think that so many
people cannot be protesting through idleness

mentions the present excessive cost of petrol that does not only affect truck
drivers:

We should all join the

For [@culebr0](http://twitter.com/#!/CULEBR0/statuses/37546242724728832), the
responsibility for what happened rests with the government. Camilo Andrés
Suárez ([@Kami_an](http://twitter.com/KAMI_AN/statuses/37556506677219328))
shares the difficulties that his secretary experienced due to the standstill
of some of the streets of Bogotá and therefore, of specific transport routes.
His secretary arrived at her home late at night because of the problems in
getting transportation:

> ahora la secre de la empresa me cuenta las peripecias que tuvo que pasar
> anoche para llegar a su casa a las 12AM, gracias[

Now the company secretary tells me about the incidents that she had to go
through last night in order to reach her home at 12 am, thanks
[#truckdriverstrike](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23parocamionero) !!

She also told him about hundreds of people who had to opt to walk in order to
reach their destinations [due to the streets’ conditions ](http://<a

Opponents allude to the chaos caused by the lack of mobility and the loss of
stored foods in containers. Camilo de Guzmán
