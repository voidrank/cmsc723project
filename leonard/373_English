Major agricultural regions in China are facing their worst drought in 60
years.

According to government statistics released January 28, 2011, 7.7 million mu
(5,160 million square km) of agricultural land, 2.57 million people and 2.79
million livestock have been hit by the drought. The immediate impact has been
[rising food prices](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/11/11/china-rising-
prices-and-rooftop-gardens/). Indeed, its implication on [food
security](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/food-
insecurity-2010/) has prompted the United Nations’ food agency to [issue a
warning](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/business/global/09food.html) to the
world's grain markets.

Despite the drought's serious social and political implications, there hasn't
been much concern among opinion leaders on major Chinese web platforms. The
online public sphere has been dominated by urban concerns, as Wang Xiaojian
[points out](http://t.sina.com.cn/1084239687/5en0RDRurwv) in Sina micro-blog:

> 有乡亲上家里问我，是否能让水利部门拨款打口井灌溉农田。我说基本不可能！山东、河北、河南三省130天无有效降雨，冬春小麦基本无望。连续三年粮食欠
> 收，我妈让我微薄上呼吁，我说无济于事，除非田地开裂、牲畜渴死、危及到人的生命，要不然水利部门基本就不管，微薄上的精英们都在忙着打拐活动。

Some villagers knocked at my door and asked if I could help to urge the water
resource department to save the wheat sprouts in the field. I replied that it
was useless. There hasn't been any rain in Shandong, Hebei, Henan for 130
days, the winter and spring wheat could no longer be rescued. My mother asked
me to urge the public to pay attention to the agricultural problem as we have
been suffering from very poor grain harvests for the past three years. I told
her that the issue would not catch people's attention unless the land cracked
and the drought endangered human lives and livestock. The irrigation
department would not care and the opinion leaders in microblogs only are too
busy with the anti-kidnapping campaign.

While a number of microbloggers helped to pass on Wang's message, ultimately
there wasn't much of an echo. Sunwen Susan (孙雯-苏三) commented on Wang's
message, pointing out that people care more about the property market than the
country's agriculture development, as the former is more profitable:

> 现在河南省的干旱还在持续，开封郊区和郑州相连的地方，那些农田都被用作开发房地产了，他们八成觉得越干越好吧~(2月6日 11:25)

Henan province is still suffering from drought. In the area between Kaifeng
and Chengzhou, the agricultural land has been transformed into property
development land. They (government and developers) probably find the drought
serving their interest in time. (6 Feb 11:25)

In order to catch people's attention to the severe drought, He Yanan
[posted](http://t.sina.com.cn/1650426515/l4EOt8FzJ) a picture showing poor
children drinking dirty water to his microblog:

> 看看这是干旱地区孩子们喝的水…我们正在遭受60年一遇的特大旱灾，不出意外的话，这将是大多数人有生见过最旱的一年，从＂点滴＂做起，刻不容缓，行动吧，朋友！

Look at the water these children in drought-affected regions drink… we are now
facing the worst drought in 60 years, by far the worst drought most of us will
see in our lifetime. We have to act by saving each single drop of water.

Blogger Zhang Teimian also posts some photos
[showing](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_498d857d01017dfm.html) the situation
in his homeland in Shandong in his blog:

> 没有太多的话，我拍这些照片的时候真的是哭着拍的。。。作为一个农村出生的娃，我深切的知道，庄稼对农民意味着什么。
>
> 一直在城市里面，虽然也知道旱情挺严重的，每次打电话回家，爸爸都会叹息，说再不下雨麦子就完了。过年回到农村老家，刚看到麦田，就明白了旱灾的严重，记
> 得往年春节期间，虽然天气也都很冷，但是麦田里的颜色还都是深绿色的，可是今年却是一片黄绿色。并且今年大年初二就是立春的节气，按照常理，麦苗也要开始
> 返青了，可是今年。。
>
> 走进麦田，看着青青的麦苗，其实很多都已经直接风干了，用手一折就会断掉，近五个月没有降雨，旱情实在太严重了。。。

I don't have much to say, I was crying when taking these photos… I was born in
a rural village and I understand the meaning of grain to the rural peasants.
