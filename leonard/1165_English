In Colombia, people don't celebrate Valentine's day on February 14th, but
instead, celebrate the whole month of September with the peak during the third
weekend. On these days not only romantic couples give each other presents, but
friends also get together for drinks or to eat, and one of the most frequent
ways to celebrate the month is through gift exchanges, quite common in
workplaces and classrooms.

[Juan Felipe Beltrán ](http://juanfemusic.blogspot.com/2009/09/amor-y-
amistad.html)writes on his blog:

> Es el mes donde las personas, amigos, parejas y enamorados se reúnen para

It is the month when people, friends, couples and lovers get together to spend
a month of happiness, joy, harmony and life. In some parts, people play secret
friend, the game consists that in the beginning there is a monitor in charge
of the game who gives a bag with names and each person has to pull out a
paper, in this paper is written the name of the person who will be your secret
friend, you can't tell any of your friends who you got because the fun in the
game is not revealing who your friend is, because it wouldn't be secret any
more. Then each day you need to give your secret friend something, for example
in one day you have to give something salty, the next something sweet, the
next something sour, the next a joke and so on until the last day of the game
arrives when there is a special present. In Colombia it is one of the most
expected months and the most special one in the year.

However, not many share this point of view regarding gift exchanges. [Emmanuel
Ariza ](http://ladivisiondeariza.blogspot.com/2009/09/juguemos-al-enemigo-
oculto.html)writes about why he dislikes this celebration:

> Aun hoy me atormentan las pesadillas de mis época de colegial, tener que
> comprarle un regalo a un “amigo secreto”, que por más que me esmerara,
> siempre iba a ser poca cosa para él. Todo para que a fin de cuentas, el
> pelafustán que tendría que darme el regalo a mí, diera cualquier bicoca
> comprada ahí de afán.

Still today I'm tormented by nightmares from my times at school, having to buy
a gift for a “secret friend”, that no matter how much effort I put into it,
was always going to be underappreciated. All this just so that at the end of
the matter, the jerk who was supposed to give me a present, would gift me any
piece of crap bought in a hurry.

From youtube, creative [online video collective Internautismo
Crónico](http://www.facebook.com/internautismo?ref=ts), has [posted a
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF_8PHAnSc4) where one of their most
famous characters, the Zarco (meaning someone with blue eyes), explains why he
doesn't play secret friend anymore. The character of el Zarco represents many
of the youth that live in marginal areas of the city of Medellin, and speaks
with a specific slang called parlache. In the video, he explains his reasons
for not playing secret friend.

The reasons El Zarco gives are the following:

  * it is a comercial invention and as such, it requires money, which he doesn't have
  * he gets picked by the laziest one who doesn't make an effort.
  * effort is not rewarded, and gifts given are not similar in value
  * picking out names from a bag and getting someone he dislikes is annoying
  * getting IOUs instead of candy from lazy secret friends.
  * not getting candy but having to give, and seeing everyone else get theirs.
  * day of unveiling secret friends is annoying, people holler cat call and expect kissing and hugging.
  * he is always single and depressed during love and friendship month but…
  * if he is not single, he has to split himself between friends, girlfriends and lovers.

At the end the Zarco proposes making this month a time to spend with friends
and loved ones, taking the time to make peace with anyone with whom we don't
get along very well, but not a time for these meaningless games… however, he
admits that he will be playing this year again.

The game has taken an online tint as well. Secret Follower (or
#FollowerSecreto) is the new method by which Colombian twitters are
participating with their friends from the popular micro-blogging platform. The
methodology is explained [in this page
](http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AcgjJF1OaEuXZGhzNDYyc3JfMGdzdzk4eGQ1&hl=es)
and through [this tool,
](http://www.actionsite.net/followersecreto/index.php)people can send their
secret follower messages, and anyone can also check out their own present.
[Click on the menu
button](http://www.actionsite.net/followersecreto/index.php) and select a
twitter user to see the types of gifts they have received: phrases of
friendship, images of cute animals or candy, videos, poems and more.

The small gifts are popularly called “endulzadas” which means “to sweeten”,
and in this online version they consist of nice pictures to share, links to
fun websites or to sites where they can download their specific present. One
of the presents is the following example, a [short video
