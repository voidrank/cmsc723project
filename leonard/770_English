to-challenge-claims-of-iranian-cleric/boobquake/)Jennifer McCreight, a Purdue
University student in the United States [is asking
](http://www.jconline.com/article/20100424/NEWS0501/100423039)women around the
world to show a little cleavage or a little leg on Monday as a humorous test
to disprove an Iranian cleric’s theory that immodest dress has the power to
make the earth shake.

The story began when Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, Tehran's acting Friday prayer
leader, [said](http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=45966): “Many women
who do not dress modestly… lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and
spread adultery in society, which (consequently) increases earthquakes.”

Jen McCreight who describes herself as a liberal, geeky, nerdy, scientific,
perverted atheist feminist trapped in Indiana,[
wrote](http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-
boobs.html) in her blog:

The Boobquake event on Facebook already has 123,680 confirmed
[supporters](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=116336578385346), including
many men. The photo above is from the Facebook page.

And here is a video message on Boobquake:

Iranians themselves have also launched creative campaigns against censorship
and repression in the past. One of the most recent was the[ Men in hijab
campaign](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/12/iran-men-in-hijab-to-
support-jailed-student/) to support Majid Tavakoli, a jailed leading student
activist. It seems the Iranian story has become world wide sensation this
time.
