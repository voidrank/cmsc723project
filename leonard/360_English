Despite the [fall of Tunisian
president](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/) Zine El Abidine Ben Ali following a popular revolt and the
[forced departure of Egyptian
president](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-
protests-2011/) Hosni Mubarak, Algerians have still not managed to own their
streets.

The two attempts by the National Coordination for Change and Democracy to
organize a march in Algiers on February 12 and 19, 2011, failed, mostly
because of the security measures set up to prevent Algerians from protesting,
but also due to the weakness of the organizations calling for the
demonstrations.

For Algerian web surfer Dihya Roufi, the difference [is
obvious](http://www.forum algerie.com/discussiongenerale/45033-algerie-et-
revolution.html) [now unavailable]:

Everyone in Algeria is aware of the need for change but the parameters in the
various countries are not the same, so the methods will be different and
specific to Algeria. In Tunisia, we saw a sudden outburst because in that
country freedoms are completely repressed. A simple joke, a word, or a song
against the regime meant prison and torture…

On February 12, 2011, nearly 2,000 people took part in the demonstration in
May First Square in capital Algiers. Security forces prevented demonstrators
from marching in the city's main streets.

The blogger R.Z [writes](http://motsdtete06damizour.unblog.fr/2011/02/12/la-
marche-du-cncd-empecheele-pouvoir-sort-les-gros-moyens-et-lentv-comme-a-son-

The security apparatus rolled out for the demonstration was not the only thing
discouraging Algerians from participating. Some of the organizers of the march
were discredited because they are members of parliament. _Algerienmeskine_

Khaled Satour makes his case in an article entitled “[Algérie : Le leurre de

le-leurre-de-la-%C2%ABrevolution-arabe-%C2%BB/)” (Algeria: The Illusion of the
