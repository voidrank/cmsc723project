Following a [near-blackout of Internet
service](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/28/egypt-an-internet-
blackhole/) on January 27, it seems that the last remaining ISP–Noor Group,
which has approximately 8% of market share–has now been cut off as well,
leaving Egyptians without any form of Internet access.

@Alaa, who has been in touch with family and friends in Cairo via phone,
[confirmed the news](http://twitter.com/#!/alaa/status/32188460668297216):

With landlines available, it's possible that some Egyptians will manage to
dial out via international networks. Global Voices will attempt to continue
coverage through our network of local contacts.
