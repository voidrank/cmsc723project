With hot button issues such as swine flu, abortion and health care reform
often dominating the headlines, it can be easy to overlook an equally vital,
though less attention-grabbing, health issue: [palliative
care](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care). This type of care focuses
on relieving suffering and improving the quality of life for people facing
life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer and HIV/AIDS.

[World Hospice and Palliative Care Day](http://www.worldday.org/welcome/),
which takes place today, seeks to change that by celebrating and supporting
hospice and palliative care globally. While it's true that one day is not
enough to create real change for the millions of people who rely on or need
this type of care, it can help bring much-needed attention to the issue. Not
only are these stories largely omitted from news headlines, [one
study](http://pmj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/23/6/545) finds that even
online educational materials about the topic need to be revised to make them
more understandable. Throughout much of the world there's a lack of
understanding about this type of care, as well as a lack of access to these
services.

The theme for this year's World Hospice and Palliative Care Day is
“Discovering your voice,” so organizers asked people from around the world to
make their voices heard and [submit their
stories](http://www.worldday.org/share-your-story/) online. In response,
people from countries ranging from [Portugal](http://www.worldday.org/share-
your-story/view-stories/?entryid55=23746) and
[India](http://www.worldday.org/share-your-story/view-
stories/?entryid55=23095) to [Malaysia](http://www.worldday.org/share-your-
story/view-stories/?entryid55=21386) reflected on the issue. Beatriz Thompson,
for example, of Belize [shares](http://www.worldday.org/share-your-story/view-
stories/?entryid55=16087&p=2) this account:

> “This is the story of a brave little boy. His name is Julian Wohler. At the
> age of one and a half year he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Julian
> fought this cancer for 4 1/2 years. He underwent 5 surgeries cycles of chemo
> and radiation in Merida Yucatan, Mexico. Julian had to travel 11 hours from
> Belize to go receive treatment every 2 weeks. When the tumor came back for
> the last time Julian told his parents he was not going back for anymore
> chemo or surgery. He wanted to stay home and enjoy himself.”

Hospice Casa Sperantei in Romania

[Hospice Casa Sperantei](http://hospice.ong.ro/e_index.htm), based in Brasov,
Romania, is a leader of palliative care in Eastern Europe. The hospice
received a [Rising Voices](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/)
[microgrant]( https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2008/06/28/public-
health-projects-to-use-citizen-media-to-empower-community-voices/) last year
to train its staff to use new media to share and preserve their patients’
stories, as well as spread awareness about Romania's palliative care issues.
The project's [blog](http://pacientihospice.wordpress.com/) shares patients’
stories in Romanian. For example, Gabriel, R.G. on the blog, has leukemia and
has been at the hospice since 2006. In this post, the 64-year-old discusses
his difficulties in dealing with a recent setback, [saying](
http://pacientihospice.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/mi-s-a-parut-ca-se-
imbunatateste-treaba/):

> “My disease began last year with partial paralysis. I did 10 sessions at the
> hospital and I felt like everything was changing for the good. Three days
> later, I was in the kitchen and I fell down. Since then no more stability
> and I am very weakened. Firstly it affected me in a psychological way, like
> I was being destroyed. I was on the verge of disappearing, I wanted anything
> to happen, just to escape, because it is torture, a very hard torture.”

Judi Chamberlin, blogging in the United States on _Life as a Hospice Patient_
, also shares the ups and downs of having a life-limiting illness. She suffers
from a chronic lung disease and lung infection, among other health problems.
In this recent post, she talks about feeling discouraged and
[reflects](http://judi-lifeasahospicepatient.blogspot.com/2009/10/weak-and-
discouraged.html) on her father:

> “I find myself saying so many of the things my Dad used to say in his final
> months–he used to talk about feeling weary, and now I know just what he
> meant. Everything, even the most mundane activity, like going to the
> bathroom, becomes a major production. When someone would point out some nice
> upcoming activity he would say “hallelujah” or “whoop-de-doo,” hating to be
> diverted with something that felt so minor in the grand scheme of things.
> And although he was eighty four when he died, and I'm not quite sixty five
> (my birthday is October 30th), I know just what he meant when he would say,
> “I've lived too long.” I always planned to live to a ripe old age, but that
> was only if it was an active, busy life–the life I used to lead, the life I
> loved.”

In addition to firsthand accounts of living with a disease, many palliative
care-related blogs, videos and other new media also share the views of
caregivers, health care professionals and family members of someone with a
life-threatening disease. In Uganda, patratm, a doctor and hematologist,
[tweets]( http://twitter.com/patratm) about various palliative care issues. In
South Africa, a video shares the story of Zodwa Sithole over images of hospice
care. Sithole watched her sister die of cancer at a hospice and is now part of
the Hospice Palliative Care Association of South Africa.

Risa Denenberg, blogging on _risa's pieces_ in the United States, is a nurse
who looks after patients with life-threatening illnesses. In her blog she
reflects on her experiences as a palliative care provider. In this post, she
[talks about](http://risaden.blogspot.com/2009/05/he-died-this-morning-
about-2am.html ) the pain of losing a patient:

> “Pager bleats its rising and lowering notes (de-da-do-da-de). Familiar as my
> name, but as I am wading from sleep to wake…It's the nursing home, telling
> me he has died. It's 2:15 am…
>
> …The hardness was that he didn't want to die, wasn't ready, much too young,
> much too much undone, had just started over, this thing caught him in the
> neck and strangled him without so much as a warning punch. And the pain. Was
> terrible. Even on the highest doses of opioids I have ever prescribed. Pain
> mixed with fear, anger, angst. I think I loved him for these few weeks, a
> helpless sort of love because I couldn't make it better. I thought.
>
> Daughter said to me: “He liked you. Really liked you. That's a big
> complement, you know. He sees right through shit, and you were real to him.”

shantanu.dutta, blogging on _Mutiny_ in India, talks about a friend who died
of cancer at a hospice. At the time, there seemed to be only one hospice in
New Delhi, where space opened up when a patient passed away. He
[says](http://mutiny.in/2008/03/11/palliative-care-love-in-a-time-of-
hopelessness/) he learned the value of hospice firsthand through that
experience:

> “The famous psycho-oncologist Buckman…said that “there was one missing
> chapter in Harrison's Textbook of Internal Medicine. The missing chapter
> was, ‘What do you do when all the treatment advised in all the other
> chapters fail?’
>
> Palliative care is that missing chapter. It is missing in our planning,
> priorities and programs but is fast emerging from the shadows as an urgent
> necessity as we and our loved ones live longer and become more and more
> prone to debilitating and life threatening diseases that can not be perhaps
> be cured but with some a professional approach endured, and possibly endure
> well.”
