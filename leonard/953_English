For promoting same sex relationship which is contrary to religious beliefs,
the Commission on Elections [(Comelec)](http://www.comelec.gov.ph/) has
[rejected](http://dantonremoto2010.blogspot.com/2009/12/its-final-comelec-
denies-gay-groups.html) the petition of gay group _Ang Ladlad_ to be
recognized as a party that can run in the 2010 Philippine elections. As
expected, the Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgender (LGBT) community is
not happy over this ruling.

The 2010 presidential elections will be held on May. _Ang Ladlad_ will
participate in the elections through the partylist system. According to the
Philippine Constitution, 20 percent of members of Congress should come from
partylist groups which represent the country's underrepresented and
marginalized sectors.

The _Ang Ladlad_ group is surprised that the government body used [religious
texts](http://taatamata.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/ang-ladlads-statement/)
instead of legal documents to justify the ruling:

> We are very unhappy with COMELEC’s decision to deny accreditation to _Ang
> Ladlad_. We feel that COMELEC did not perform its responsibility to
> promulgate electoral policy because its decision was based not on legal
> documents, but entirely on religious texts (i.e. the Bible and the Koran).
>
> _Ang Ladlad_ , along with the entire LGBT community, does not promote a
> doctrine of immorality; COMELEC has no business calling Ang Ladlad immoral
> without legal basis. Also, calling _Ang Ladlad_ a threat to the youth is
> unsubstatiated, thus, it cannot be supported in a legal document like the
> COMELEC decision.

_Sampaloc TOC_ [believes](http://sampaloctoc.blogspot.com/2009/11/render-onto-
comelec-that-which-is.html) the poll pody should not have used religious
documents in considering the case of the LGBT group

> I think fundamentally, the error in judgment from Comelec comes from the
> hubris that it can determine ecclesiastical law. These are not men of the
> cloth but of the law. The constitution does not vest Comelec with the
> ecclesiastical jurisdiction. It is an organ of the government of the
> Philippine republic. Comelec cannot consider the Bible or the Qu'ran
> procedurely.

The poll body also accused the LGBT group of promoting immorality. Karen Jane
Ang advises public authorities to stop acting as [morality
cops](http://www.thepoc.net/commentaries/2961-ang-ladlad.html)

> COMELEC should stop acting as our morality police. It is not part of their
> duties and responsibilities. We already have religious groups who tell us
> what we must or must not do, who to emulate or abhor, and which candidates
> to support or abandon. We do not need another group who does the same.

_RP2010.com_ urges the poll body officials [not to
discriminate](http://rp2010.com/2009/11/ang-ladlad-party-list.html) against
the LGBT sector

> The assertion by Ferrer, along with co-commissioners Lucenito Tagle and
> Elias Yusoph, that gay people are an immoral group is nothing but a clear
> indication of their personal discrimination against the LGBT community.
> Government, by its very reason for being, must not be allowed to
> discriminate against any sector of society.
>
> The “3 Stooges” — as Ferrer & co. have been nicknamed — also claim that LGBT
> Filipinos are already “over-represented” in Congress. Are jibes such as that
> really necessary?

_Apples Daily_ challenges the poll body to disqualify all corrupt and [immoral
politicians](http://applesdaily.com/2009/11/comelecs-blow-ladlad/)

> The COMELEC surmised that simply being homosexual/ bisexual/ transexual is
> immoral. If they’re all about morality, then maybe they should not let
> politicians, who are or have been involved in crimes, corruptions and other
> mundane scandals, to run in the 2010 elections. Why don’t they go ask every
> religious person to file for candidacy, since it looks like there won’t be
> anyone left to run in 2010… but then, even these religious people might not
> pass their morality test.
