After months for some; and years of battle for others – the moment when a
soldier returns from duty abroad can capture human emotion like no other. On
YouTube, videos of soldiers coming home have multiplied over the past several
years.

In this video, a mother cries when she finds her son at home after a six month
stint in Afghanistan. Apparently, according to his mom, he got “Bigger.”

Surprising mothers is a trend, at least for some soldiers. This soldier gives
his mother the best present she could ever receive on her birthday.

Another soldier caught his son off guard when he visited his school. There
isn't much dialogue in the video but the words “Daddy” should say enough for
most viewers.

Children aren't the only ones who see their loved ones take off to serve the
country. In this final video, the homecoming was sweeter than sweet. A solider
receives a warm greeting from his dog.
