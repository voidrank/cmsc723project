On April 7th, Rwanda commemorated the 16th anniversary of the genocide that
took the lives of as many as 800,000 people and traumatized a whole region to
this day. The genocide is commemorated to keep the memory of the victims alive
and honor them but also to help the country move forward in the spirit of
unity and reconciliation. Survivors of the genocide recall those 100 days when
humanity as a whole failed them immensely and consistently. Many of them are
involved in the reconstruction process, creating networks to sustain
coexistence. In the aftermath of French president Sarkozy recent visit to
Kigali and acknowledging in a joint press conference with President Kagame
that [“mistakes were made”](http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101621494-au-
rwanda-sarkozy-s-incline-sans-s-excuser) in 1994 (fr), bloggers discuss the
meaning of Genocide Memorial Day (although commemorations really last a week)
and the complexity of Rwanda's international relations.

Tutsi survivor _Norah Bagarinka_ recalls how [she was stopped by
militiamen](http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/take_action/gallery/portrait/bagarinka)
but was eventually saved by one of them who happened to be her gardener:

> He took us, my other and three other ladies, aside on the other bush. When
> we reached there, he got some leaves, bandaged my hand, and he told us: ”
> Run, run for your safety”. And he apologized.

The project _Voices of Rwanda_ records the life stories of Rwandans – not just
stories about the genocide, but about their lives as whole. This testimony
from a survivors explain why [she feels compelled to
remember](http://www.voicesofrwanda.org/whosevoice.html) and provide her
testimony:

> ” If I die without telling my story here, my lineage will be snuffed out”

Blogger _Mamadou Kouyate_ posts an article on the [recollection of a group of
Australian soldiers from the UN peacekeeping
team](http://hungryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/03/ghosts-of-genocide-story-of-
kibeho.html#links) of the Kibeho massacre:

> “Many of the vets have a lot of guilt about what happened because they were
> not able to do the best they could do to save lives. They could not do
> anything to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.”[..] “All that
> seemed to remain was the stench of genocide and children abandoned by war
> pathetically wandering the streets, traumatised by the death and destruction
> they had witnessed.”

The commemoration in Amohoro (Peace) Stadium were followed by 20,000 people in
a calm and uplifting atmosphere. _Sara Strawczynski_ provides a description of
t[he Walk to Remember in the streets of
Kigali](http://fellowsblog.kiva.org/2010/04/07/a-walk-to-remember/):

> During my months living and working as a Kiva Fellow in Rwanda, I’ve had a
> hard time reconciling what I know to have taken place with what I experience
> day-to-day. Kigali is a safe, clean and beautiful city. The countryside is
> lush and stunning. [..] That said, signs of Rwanda’s genocide are never far
> beneath the surface [..] we passed two groups of prisoners, easily
> identifiable in their pink, orange and blue jumpsuits. Rwanda’s prisons are
> filled with people accused and convicted of genocide and war crimes, and its
> incarceration rate is among the highest in the world.

_Jenny Clover_ attended [a commemoration at the Church of
Nyamata](http://jenny-clover.blogspot.com/2010/04/if-you-knew-me-and-you-knew-
yourself.html) where 10,000 people were killed:

> The church at Nyamata is filled with the clothes of all 10,000 people who
> died there – thousands and thousands of shirts, dresses, socks and trousers
> piled on church pews. They start to blur into one after a while – just a
> muddy pile of tatty clothes, pulled from a mass grave where the murderers
> tried to cover up what they had done. [..] There's a lot more to say about
> the memorial at Nyamata: the rows and rows of skulls neatly lined up in the
> cold underground crypt, some with clean machete cuts right though them..

This is the second time that _Jina Moore_ __ is in Rwanda during Memorial Day.
She is torn between “[the obligation to attend and the urge to stay
away](http://www.jinamoore.com/2010/04/07/time/)“:

> Many are marking something they know from memory; others are remembering the
> loss of family, even if they were abroad and did not face genocide
> themselves. But this is not my memory. Without a doubt, I will spend the
> better part of today thinking of my friends who are survivors, and thinking
> of the family they lost who, through my friends’ stories, feel almost like
> people I knew, too. Perhaps I will mark some part of the day with those
> friends. Perhaps not. There is often discussion among the mzungus here of
> whether it's intrusive of us to go to these programs, or on the other hand
> whether it's disrespectful not to. I don't think there's a rule.

Many local bloggers have also reacted to the complex relations between Rwanda
and the international community.

_Stephane Ballong_ explains that the [relation between Rwanda and
France](http://www.afrik.com/article16576.html) is still a bit tense (fr):

> En août 2008, Kigali qui a rompu ces relations diplomatiques avec Paris,
> avait menacé de traduire en justice 33 personnalités françaises. Dans un
> rapport de 500 pages, les autorités rwandaises ont dénoncé l’implication du
> gouvernement français dans le génocide. Le document confirmait les
> responsabilités directes de treize politiciens et vingt militaires français
> dans ces tueries.

In August 2008, Kigali severed diplomatic ties with Paris and threaten to
pursue in court 33 French personalities. In a 500-pages long report, the
Rwandan authority denounced the involvement of France in the genocide. The
document confirmed the direct ties of 13 politicians and 20 French army
personnel in the killings.

_Christophe Ayad_ goes into [more details about these
allegations](http://africa.blogs.liberation.fr/diplomatie/2010/04/rwanda-1-le-
gendarme-la-veuve-et-la-barbouze.html) that will be published in a dossier
called ” « _La France au Rwanda_ » (fr):

> Dans «Là haut, sur la colline de Bisesero», Jean-François Dupaquier fait le
> récit des premiers jours de l'opération Turquoise -opération militaro-
> humanitaire controversée et destinée à «stopper les massacres»- à travers le
> témoignage long et détaillé de l'adjudant-chef Thierry Prungnaud, gendarme
> du GIGN. Il est envoyé en élément précurseur sous le commandement du COS
> (Commandement des opérations spéciales). Pendant plusieurs jours, il ne
> comprend rien à la situation. Et pour cause. Voici le tableau de la
> situation qu'on lui a dressé avant sa mission: «Les Tutsis exterminent les
> Hutus. Nous sommes venus pour les protéger, mettre fin aux massacres (…)
> Votre rôle est de vous informer de la situation sur le terrain, de voir où
> en sont les rebelles du FPR». C'est exactement le contraire de la réalité:
> les Tutsis sont massacrés par les Hutus et le Front Patriotique Rwandais
> (FPR) n'est en rien impliqué dans le génocide, qu'il cherche plutôt à
> stopper.

In “Up in the Bisesero Hill”, Jean-François Dupaquier tells the story of the
first day of l'opération Turquoise- a semi-humanitarian military operation
destined to stop the massacres- through the testimony of Thierry Prungnaud,
member of GIGN armed forces. Prungnaud is sent on a reconnaissance mission
under the command of the COS ( Special Operation Command). For days, he cannot
make sense of the situation. Indeed, he was told before his mission that:
Tutsis were exterminating Hutus. We are here to protect them and end the
massacre (..) your role is to stay informed about the situation on site and to
determine the location of the FPR rebels. It is quite the opposite of reality:
The Tutsis were being massacred by the Hutus and the FPR (Rwandan Patriotic
Front) had nothing to do with the genocide, instead they were trying to stop
it

France is not the only country being accused of involvement in Rwanda's
tragedy. _Mamadou Kouyate_ posts on his blog [an
article](http://hungryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/04/us-was-behind-rwandan-
genocide.html) by _Michel Chossudovsky_ at _Global Research_ that claims that
the war in Rwanda and the ethnic massacres were [part of US foreign
policy](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=CHO20100407&articleId=18540).

All these allegations and the still palpable trauma from the tragedy make for
a very complex diplomatic and political scene in Rwanda. Local bloggers are
weary that a few months away from the elections ( scheduled in august 2010),
political tensions might rise again. _Jean-Marie Vianney Ndagijimana_ writes
that the opposition party, Les Forces Démocratiques Unifiées-Inkingi (FDU-
Inkingi) has been [under duress on several occasions](http://www.france-
rwanda.info/article-la-nature-totalitaire-du-regime-rwandais-47788120.html),
namely by being denied passports, being subject to arbitrary police
investigations and physical threats.
