Protests against the Ali Abdulla Saleh regime in Yemen started three months
ago, and continue to rage as protesters call for an end to his 32-year rule.

Pro-Saleh protesters have also been visible, in their tens of thousands,
rallying for support for the Yemeni president, and often clashing with
protesters.

The description reads:

الفرق بين مؤيدي الرئيس اليمني والمطالبين باسقاط النظام وقت الغداء

The difference between the supporters of the Yemeni president and those
calling for the overthrow of his regime during lunch time.

The first part of the video shows filthy roads, and what is alleged to be
Saleh supporters squabbling for food parcels. At one point, the netizen video
taping the incident is told off and asked not to film further.

The second part of the video shows orderly rows of protesters, eating food,
and then cleaning up after their meal is over.

The aim of the video is to show the difference between the two camps.

يؤيدون الرئيس على شان وجبه غداء
