inmates.html)And they've done it again. Last June 27, convicted criminals from
Cebu danced to the tunes of the late Michael Jackson in [a tribute performance
marking the first death anniversary of the famous music
icon](http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20100626-277706/Cebu-
jailbirds-stage-Michael-Jackson-memorial-dance).

Back in 2007, over a thousand inmates of a maximum security prison in the
central Philippine island-province of Cebu became an international hit after
jail authorities posted [a footage of the prisoners dancing to Michael
Jackson's “Thriller”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMnk7lh9M3o) on the
Internet.

With more than 42 million views on YouTube, the music video of the Cebuano
prisoners has become one of the most watched clips on the internet.

_Lindsay's Adventure in the Philippines_ felt [estranged by the sight of the
dancing inmates](http://lindsayincebu.blogspot.com/2010/06/dancing-
inmates.html).

_The Fountain Yield_ saw the performances as [a form of therapy for the
prisoners](http://www.thefountainyield.co.cc/2010/06/in-my-opinion-dancing-

Meanwhile, _Hellagood Ed's Wee Weblog_ interrogates the [role of music in

Last year, these same group of imprisoned criminals also performed a tribute
to Jackson just two days after his death. The official footages of the
performance has yet to be uploaded online. Here's an unofficial video of this
year's performance:
