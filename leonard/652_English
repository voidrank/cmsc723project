Compared to the massive flooding disasters in Pakistan and China, the [series
of floods](http://www.mysinchew.com/node/42260) in Singapore in the past month
can be described as a minor catastrophe. But the last serious flooding in the
garden city of Singapore was more than thirty years ago, in
[1978](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/24/focus/6717827&sec=focus).
Residents are angry and they want answers for the apparent lack of government
preparation and response during the freak floods.

The “endless” property development in Singapore was cited as one of the causes
of the floods, particularly in the high-end enclave of Orchard Road. _The
Lycan Times_ [explains](http://www.nowhere.per.sg/?p=1494)

> Simply put, the recent rains are not extraordinary. The meteorological
> service has not shown us that rainfall has hit a historical new high. The
> only engineering we need to look into is all that mindless ‘civil
> engineering’ as a result of the endless property development in Singapore.

[Dr Chan Joon Yee](http://www.newagedentists.com/heartbreaking-news/your-
problem-small-problem/) can’t believe that flooding took place in the shopping
district of Orchard Road

> Flooding is not something new to Orchard Road. It happens every year. It’s
> just that such incidents never made the news because they were not serious
> enough to make shopkeepers cry. Finally, things got serious last month.
> Goods were destroyed. Shops were damaged. Shopkeepers cried. Singapore was
> shocked.
>
> Orchard Road is the last place in Singapore that should be flooded. In a
> land of glitzy malls, 2 integrated resorts and extravagant, state of the art
> NDP displays, submerged cars in a prime shopping district is an utter
> embarrassment. Still, we were told that we had to accept it. Just once.
> Never mind.

A senior government minister referred to the flood as an [‘act of
God’](http://de-leviathan.blogspot.com/2010/07/tale-of-two-cities-engineering-
flood.html) and added that no engineering solution can prevent the flooding.
_The Temasek Review_ [reacts](http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/07/22/what-
are-the-kpis-for-the-environment-ministry-in-flood-prevention/) to this
argument

> No Singaporean is expecting Singapore to be completely flood-free. The
> question is: is it acceptable for Singapore to be hit by flash floods five
> times within 30 days? Is this performance acceptable for a self-proclaimed
> first world government?
>
> Enough of throwing smoke-screens to obfuscate the matter and cover up for
> their own incompetence
>
> It is a shame that Singapore’s prime shopping district is flooded not only
> once, but twice in less than a month. How can we be a world class
> cosmopolitan city when we cannot even get the basics right?

_Under the Willow Tree_ believes it is not enough to blame the [‘intense
storm’](http://utwt.blogspot.com/2010/07/great-flood-fiasco-freak-event-
or.html) for the flooding

> Yes, it is obvious that these floods are being caused by “intense storms”.
> But isn't it precisely the job of a sewerage system to be robust and to be
> able to withstand these “intense storms”? Isn't it precisely the job of the
> Ministry of Environnment to build redundancy and flexibility into the system
> to deal with such events?

_The Mind Game_ probes the implication of [blaming God and
nature](http://findmuck.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/st-cunning-in-the-front-page-
flood/) for the flooding

> We are mere mortals in a struggle against the infinite power of God and
> nature. Word choice is extremely important here, since the term ‘God’ brings
> to mind forces more powerful and uncontrollable than nature.
>
> The implication is that it’s really not the government’s fault, its the
> space constraints and the will of God. Above all, we simply cannot be
> perfect. In other words, not much more can be done.

Singapore Marina Barrage by ngotoh under a Creative Commons Attribution-

One of the functions of the Singapore Marina Barrage is to control
floodwaters. In the past month, its reliability has been questioned by many
writers.

Chen Jinwen thinks that [soil erosion](http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=7287)
worsened the flooding disaster. The proposal is to slow down on construction

> The simple solution is to slow down the unrelenting pace of construction,
> particularly in our flood-prone areas. While discussing the latest flooding,
> a friend of mine pointed out Orchard road’s ‘makeover’, remarking that
> “whatever empty space we had is or is going to be taken up by shopping
> centres”.

_New Asia Republic_ writes that the [flood
losses](http://newasiarepublic.com/?p=19783) outweigh the purported benefits
from the disaster

> …it is common to hear comments such as “the floods helped the auto repair
> industry”. There is frequent overlooking of what otherwise the money could
> have been utilized more productively by the car owners. What seemingly looks
> like a gain to the auto repair industry is actually a loss incurred by the
> car owner.

_Everything also complain_ hits the use of
[sandbags](http://everythingalsocomplain.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/orchard-
road-sandbags/) as a flood defense strategy

> This sandbag fortification is like peasants in biblical times preparing for
> one of the impending Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Nonetheless, desperate
> times call for ugly desperate measures, though stacking up sandbags like
> you’re engaging in trench warfare and scaring off customers rather than
> doing business really defeats its purpose of curbing the floods in the first
> place.

Siew Kum Hong echoes the [anger](http://siewkumhong.blogspot.com/2010/07/more-
on-50-year-floods.html) of many residents

> I think what has shocked and upset people, are the scope and location of the
> floods that have been occurring, and the Government's cavalier response so
> far. Frankly, if the flooding had been limited to the recognised flood-prone
> areas, I'm pretty sure there would not have been the amount of backlash that
> has arisen.
>
> But they are not, they are in new areas, including very highly visible
> Orchard Road, and the Government did not know what was going on and seemed
> more interested in maintaining its not-to-be-blamed Teflon coating than in
> digging in and figuring out what really happened — the first step to finding
> a solution. That was what was most disappointing.

_Thetwophilo's Blog_ uses Google Earth to prove that the flooding was likely
the result of [ponding](http://thetwophilo.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/the-great-
singapore-flood-a-case-of-ponding/), or a “collection of rain water in
depressions or basins.” The government has published its [official
response](http://www.gov.sg/government/web/content/govsg/classic/news/news-20100719-response+by+minister+for+the+environment+and+water+resources+dr+yaacob+ibrahim+in+parliament+on+flash+floods)
to queries about the flooding disasters.
