There has been [much
speculation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/08/cuba-the-reality-of-
revolution/) of late as to whether the spirit of protest will find its way
from [Egypt](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-
protests-2011/) and
[Tunisia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/) to the Caribbean. Havana Times

If the lock on the marketplace of information maintained by Castro's
government is what's standing between discontented Cuban citizens and protest,
then recent moves have come as no surprise to bloggers. A video available on
[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/19402730) or
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFEJZMVqhAw) betrays the government's
fear of a flare-up on the island and its attempts to use
“counterrevolutionary” bloggers’ tactics against them. It's part of an effort
called “Operation Cyber-Mambí” which, El Pequeno Hermano
[writes](http://pequenohermanoenglish.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/operation-
blogger-algorithm-for-a-disaster/), marks the Cuban government's “desperate
struggle against the Alternative Platform blogs.”

Commenting on the video, Yoani Sanchez
[says](http://www.desdecuba.com/generationy/?p=2302) that the strategies
recommended “will barely hurt the Cuban blogosphere” and that:

> “the distribution of [the video] is proof positive that our government has
> lost the monopoly on information, including its classified materials. Viva
> Cubaleaks!”

Blogging is now beginning to be complemented in Cuba by Facebook activism, or
at least that is what is suggested by a new group and event, “[Protestas
mundiales por Levantamiento popular en
Cuba](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=196665060359517&index=1)” and
page, “[por el levantamiento popular en
Cuba](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Por-el-levantamiento-popular-en-
Cuba/173839132658920?v=wall)” (for popular uprisings in Cuba), for which group
membership has jumped from 600 to nearly 2200 people in five days. Granted,
the Facebook pages were created by Cuban exiles in Spain, but the hope is that
they will ignite protest both abroad and on the island in response to the
upcoming one-year anniversary of [the death of hunger striker Orlando Zapato
Tamayo](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/25/cuban-hunger-striker-dies-
in-havana-prison/).
