This school year, the Philippine government is implementing a United Nations-
backed sex education program in public schools for children and teenagers. The
sex education program is being piloted in selected schools around the country
and will include topics such as reproductive health, HIV/AIDS prevention, and
family planning.

The Catholic Church has expressed strong opposition to the program. Bloggers
comment on the issue.

Tom Martin asks if sex education should be done [“in the classroom or behind a
tree?”](http://360yahoocomtmartin3333.blogspot.com/2010/06/sex-education-in-
classroom-or-behind.html)

> No parent is going to have absolute control over the places their children
> are going to learn about sex and it seems to me that a wise parent would at
> least want his or her children to be exposed to proper sex education by
> trained teachers in a controlled school setting rather than learning about
> sex from a peer behind a tree.

_The Pinoy Catholic_ [echoes
](http://thepinoycatholic.blogspot.com/2010/06/education-department-stops-sex-
ed.html)the official stand of the local clergy and adamantly suggests that sex
education should be left to the parents.

_A Filipina Mom Blogger_ [points
out](http://aboutmyrecovery.com/2006/07/21/sex-education-in-the-philippines/)
that not all parents may know how to discuss sex with their children:

> “We can’t assume parents know how to discuss sex openly. Some might be
> uneducated to understand the anatomy of reproduction and thus fail to grasp
> natural birth control methods.”

_The Catacomb_ [recommends ](http://myprisonmyheaven.blogspot.com/2010/06/sex-
education-for-elementary-school-in.html)that sex education should be given to
the parents instead.

> Why not leave these children alone for now.. Or maybe government should try
> to impose a law of proper parenting, where in parents are given some
> constant trainings or symposiums that will equip them with proper knowledge
> in giving their children the right guidance as they grow up. This will
> prevent not only the exposure of children to the sensitivity of sex but it
> will also give the parents a better chance to bond with their kids, spending
> quality time, giving the necessary attention, love and care…

_The x-piles_ [believes ](http://icebreaker13.blogspot.com/2010/06/sex-
education-in-philippines.html)that those against the sex education program
should go after the mass media instead.

> The church could have overlooked the real culprit for the alleged generation
> of sexual perverts – the mass media. Violence and sex are prevalent on many
> T.V. shows and movies and these are all absorbed by the youth and children
> as well. All of these have the capacity to change the moral perception of
> the youth’s developing minds, bringing them to confusion on what is right or
> wrong.

Meanwhile, _Quod Dixit Dixit_ [questions
](http://sapientiaaedificat.blogspot.com/2010/06/sex-and-children.html)the
government's motives for implementing the program.

> It is not clear to me whether the government’s move sprung from its idea
> that overpopulation is one of the root causes of grinding poverty in the
> Philippines and hence, it must be put into a lower gear. (N.B.: I always
> assume perhaps with precision that the main roots of poverty in the country
> are graft and corruption and the unabated abuse and destruction of the
> environment and natural resources.)

The women's group _Gabriela_ see the program as [a step in the right
direction](http://www.pinoypress.net/2010/07/02/the-need-for-sex-education-in-
children/).

> The Department of Education (DepEd)’s Memorandum No. 26, allowing the use of
> teaching modules on sex education, could be a positive step, granting that
> DepEd will conduct an intensive process of consultation with different
> stakeholders before full implementation. This will ensure that the program
> is not implemented mechanically, and all arguments are heard. In our part,
> GABRIELA, Gabriela Women’s Party and SALINLAHI are willing to become part of
> the consultation process and share our extensive experience in gender and
> sexuality education with children and parents.

Ducky Paredes, however, believes that [the program is as good as
dead](http://www.duckyparedes.com/blogs/2010/06/29/the-uninvited/) with the
appointment of Brother Armin Luistro FSC to the post of Secretary of Education
by the new Aquino administration.

> Is this the end of the UN-funded program for sex education for lour public
> schools? Probably. One cannot see how a Christian brother can support sex
> education for elementary and high school students considering that many in
> the Catholic Church believe that exposing students to learning about sex and
> sexuality will surely lead to unwanted pregnancies.
