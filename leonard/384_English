News is emerging on Twitter that Libyan leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi has sent in
the army against protestors, with deaths reported in Benghazi and other parts
of the country. Gaddafi is one of the longest serving dictators in the world,
now entering his 42nd year as President.

Libyans have been inspired by pro-democracy demonstrations in neighbouring
[Tunisia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/) and
[Egypt](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-protests-2011/)
that have toppled their respective rulers.

But their protests appear to have been met with stiff resistance, as Gaddafi
shows no hesitation in deploying violence to suppress anti-regime protests.
