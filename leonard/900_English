In less than 24 hours Sri Lankan voters will start to vote to decide who will
be their 6th president. The intense campaign of the candidates on the roads
have also pumped the adrenaline of the netizens as many are rallying behind
their choice of candidates and providing useful information to the voters as
well as taking up the task of online election reporting.
