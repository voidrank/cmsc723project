The recent conviction of [“rape by deceit”
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/07/21/israel-conviction-of-rape-by-
deceit/)of an Arab posing as a Jew to seduce a Jewish woman to engage in
sexual intercourse has sparked conversations across the Hebrew blogosphere
about the dire inequality between Jews and Arabs living in Israel. Many
contemplate the meaning of Israeli democracy under racially biased laws.
Others remind that it is still illegal for a Jew to marry any non-Jew within
the State of Israel. And many add hateful comments, showing support for the
conviction. In this post, I will highlight some of the meaningful comments and
posts written in the past couple of days.

First, some context:  
According to media reports, Saber Kushour introduced himself to a Jewish woman
as a Jewish bachelor seeking a serious relationship. The couple then went to a
nearby building and had consensual sexual intercourse, after which Kushour
left the building. When the woman realised Kushour was an Arab, she filed a
complaint against him.  
Saber Kushour was sentenced to 18 months in prison under charges of rape by
deception.

Below is a comment written in response to an
[article](http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/2952/1713287) posted on the popular news
portal, [walla.co.il](http://news.walla.co.il/):

> Saber Kushour wanted to be a human being, just a person, like us all. But he
> wasn't so lucky and was born Palestinian. Happens. His chances to be

> he wanted to work in Jerusalem, his city, and maybe even have a little

> The court took a hard line with his punishment, not because he raped a

The majority of comments seen on the popular news site
[nrg](http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/134/635.html) were strongly opposing
the court's decision:  
1.

> I support the right wing, but I think that in this case, they should've
> sentenced her for racism.  
>  What if he would've told her that he was rich? He'd also get a year and a
> half because she had sex with him when she thought he was wealthy?
>
> The ruling in this case really lost proportion – he did not use force, and
> she was not subject to his authority in any way. There needs to be a clear
> separation between lies and rape!

2.

> And if he had pretended to be Mormon or Buddhist or an atheist? Would he

3.

> Before she sleeps with someone in a building's stairwell… she should check

5\. Raffi added a snarky comment:

On the other hand, an anonymous post supported the case:

> She wanted a romantic connection only with Jews, and had intercourse with a
> non Jew by deception.  
>  She has all the rights to choose with whom she can have a connection and a
> relationship, just like a Muslim woman can choose to have a relationship

>  This is certainly rape – because she knew exactly what she wanted, and also
> knew exactly what she didn't want.  
>  To lie callously in order to take advantage of a woman and receive personal
> pleasure is an incredibly despicable act.

In a blog post referencing a news article from [ynet](http://ynet.co.il), a
blogger added the following image,

Translation: Arab! Don't even dare to think about a Jewish woman!

and [sparked an extremely active and hateful
discussion](http://kar0va.blogspot.com/2010/07/blog-post_5161.html) in the
comments section. The following post came against the hateful messages
proceeding it:

> Its not right what he did, but why do you all think you're better than the
> Arabs? All this racism is ruining the country. He is just a man with a bad

> NO!  
>  There's no right to curse Arabs, because this is precisely what leads them

>  We're all human beings.

Orit Kamir writes about Saber Kushour, Rape by Deception:[“the Arab who
Pretended to be a Man”](http://2nd-ops.com/orit/?p=65632):
