The election waiting game is over in Australia. Julia Gillard has formed a
minority Labor government:

The Prime Minister is a controversial figure: left leaning, never married, no
children, de facto relationship, non-believer. Graham Young of editor of
[Online Opinion](http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/) shared some research on the
impact of religion at his polls website _WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT_ :

> Research by John Black confirms that Labor lost the Christian voters it
> gained last election, but did better with atheists and agnostics. But the
> Christians were more potent, living in key electorates. Non-believers were
> highly likely to be Greens voters.

_Grog’s Gamut_ gained a national reputation as an astute political blogger
during the campaign, particularly for his criticisms of media coverage. He has
now turned his focus to the future:

> But what now for the ALP?
>
> My advice – don’t be timid. Yes it is “fragile” but the biggest fault they
> could do is to not do anything for fear of upsetting someone.
>
> The number one lesson of the Rudd Government is that people want decisions
> taken. Don’t worry if it is unpopular, worry about whether or not it is a
> good decision. And if it is a good policy, then argue its case – be an
> advocate for it, not a salesperson.

John Styles, editor of _Australian Conservative_ and contributor to _The
Spectator Australia_ views events from a very different point:

> By supporting the Labor Left-Greens alliance, the so-called Independents
> have shown contempt for their conservative constituencies…

He attacks both independents, who are former members of the conservative
National Party, but saves his strongest condemnation for the independent Rob
Oakeshoot :

> Here was Oakeshott admitting that he was giving crucial support to a party
> he didn’t believe in. He described his decision as ‘unnatural’. How about
> bizarre, weird, crazy? How about calling it just plain nuts?  
>  [Aren’t elected representatives supposed to serve the

Jane writes at _Sanity * Sustainability_ , a blog ‘about sustainable
community, the transition from cannibal consumerism to peaceful well-being and
personal spiritual discovery’. She sniffs some fresh potential that minority
government may bring to a stale parliamentary system:

> The most curious thing about this whole episode is that in spite of a
> dreadfully boring campaign, even more dreadful reporting by the media of the
> boring campaign and a system designed specifically to serve the interests of
> two major parties who serve big business at the expense of the community,
> the electorate of Australia has managed to make itself heard.

My favourite post comes from Cristy, a 38-week-pregnant feminist and political
tragic from Canberra, Australia’s Capital. I found her _In a garden….
somewhere_ :

> Now, of course, we have a new government (and thank goodness it is a
> Gillard-led minority government – I have a hopeful feeling that I am going
> to like her far more in governing-mode than I did in campaigning-mode) and
> it is time to move on with life. But given that I am now over 38 weeks
> pregnant this is no simple matter. Life in these last weeks of pregnancy
> kind of resembles life under a shifting minority government – you really
> have no idea from one day to the next what will happen. Even worse, unlike
> the situation we just went through as a nation, no one else is really
> interested in endlessly speculating about what might happen when and there
> is even less concrete information available on which to base such
> speculations.

‘Chief Blogger’ at _Right Pulse_ sees the deal by the independents in clear
combative terms. It is “ the Great Betrayal”. He/she advocates adversarial
politics as usual by the Opposition parties:

> One can think of many issues to attack the government’s credibility on.
> Carbon taxation, energy prices, budget deficit, mining tax, etc… then add in
> some of the more extreme Greens policies and you have fertile ground to hunt
> down the government.  
>  [The smell of blood – Gillard’s – It’s not over yet II
> UPDATE](http://www.rightpulse.com/archives/2463)

Right Pulse is not alone in these sentiments. The new _Australian Tea Party_
uses sexual imagery in its attacks, claiming that “people power” has stopped
independent Oakeshott from taking a position in the government as Regional
Affairs Minister:

> No two ways about it, if Oakeshott had not been email bombed with over 5000
> hostile responses to his treachery and intimations he was going to grab a
> ministry from Labor to seal his whoredom, he would today have announced
> himself as the new Minister for Regional Affairs.

The Possum at _Pollytics_ is best known as a psephologist for his statistical
analyses of opinion polls and elections. Whilst he may use an alias, he does
not hide his progressive politics in this assessment of the road ahead:

> With so many having invested so much in the defeat of the Labor government…
> to be denied victory by political inches, leaving a fragile incumbent
> holding the most delicate of majorities and being reliant on a handful of
> cross-benchers representing ideologically discordant electorates, creates a
> result that will not be respected.

Possum expects a rough time ahead from both the opposition parties and the
conservative media:

> What we will witness over the next 18 months or more is a Great Unhinging
> –an orgy of hysterics that will far surpass the duplicity, dishonesty – let
> alone the complete arsehattery – that substituted for public debate on
> matters of government during the previous 12 months.  
>  [Let the Great Unhinging
> begin](http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollytics/2010/09/08/let-the-great-
> unhinging-
> begin/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CrikeyBlogs%2Fpollytics+%28Pollytics%29)

So, it’s game over and game on! Australian politics have not been so
unpredictable since the days of Gough Whitlam’s Labor government of the early
1970s.

As I write, it has been announced that deposed Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will
be the Foreign Minister in the Gillard government.

(Personal disclosure: I have been a member of the Australian Labor Party since
1972.)
