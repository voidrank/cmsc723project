The free flow of information between Armenia and Azerbaijan since independence
is obviously problematic given the still unresolved conflict over [Nagorno
Karabakh](http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/nagorny-karabakh/contents.php),
but can new media move in to fill the gap? With the mood in both countries as
uncompromising as ever, and perhaps even worse, the task at hand is not going
to be easy for those involved in peace-building initiatives, but there is
potential.

This is especially true given the level of propaganda and misinformation often
evident in the media of both countries, leaving alternative methods of
delivering information and news sorely needed. One example of this comes in
the form of a joint[ _Internews-Conciliation Resources_
project](http://www.c-r.org/our-work/caucasus/dialogue_through_film.php) aimed
at encouraging dialogue through short films produced by young journalists in
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno Karabakh.

Technically speaking, the project itself is not one that embraces new or
social media, but with national television stations in Armenia and Azerbaijan
unwilling to show reports from the other side, the only medium through which
to distribute the materials is the Internet besides occasionally scheduled
screenings to small audiences. Nevertheless, even if all the films are not
available online, [many now
are](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=+Conciliation+Resources+armenia&aq=f).

In _Swept Away by Life_ , for example, _Internews Armenia_ looks at life in
Lachin, once inhabited by at least 20,000 ethnic Azeris and Kurds, but now
renamed Berdzor by Armenians who took it in 1992 to create a strategic land
link between Karabakh and Armenia proper. The town is now [mainly inhabited by
a few thousand socially vulnerable families from
Armenia](http://oneworld.blogsome.com/?s=lachin%20socially%20vulnerable) who
relocated with the promise of financial assistance, land and livestock.

The documentary paints a very frank and bleak picture of life in the disputed
town even though Armenia considers it vital for communication with Karabakh in
the event of any peace deal. In a touching intro, however, it starts (and also
ends) with a refugee from Baku reading aloud a letter from her former
neighbors in the Azerbaijani capital.
