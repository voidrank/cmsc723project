Train disruptions marred the operations of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transport
[(SMRT)](http://www.smrt.com.sg/main/index.asp) this month which
inconvenienced thousands of passengers and generated a heated discussion about
the quality and efficiency of the country’s [transportation
system](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/26/should-singapore-
nationalize-its-transport-system/). Initial investigation revealed 61 faults
in the rails and 13 trains were found to be defective.

Unbranded BreadnButter notes the
[decline](http://www.facebook.com/notes/unbranded-breadnbutter/smrt-on-the-
wrong-track/137499739696391) of the SMRT which was once the world’s first
listed metropolitan rail company

> When it was first listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange in 2000, it prided
> itself as the world’s first listed metropolitan rail company that was
> publicly listed. More than a decade down the road, with epic disruptions
> during the peak shopping period, cracks are appearing on this grand
> experiment once lauded as a world class public transport system.

Ravi Philemon compares the rise and fall of SMRT to [Singapore
society](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/12/the-story-of-smrt-is-the-story-
of-singapore/)

> Why do I say that the story of the SMRT is the story of Singapore? Because
> the early leaders of the country put in place various rigorous systems for
> governing the nation, and the leaders who came after them assumed that these
> systems are fool-proof; that you only need to put in place trusted aides to
> maintain these systems and everything will be fine.
>
> From 2010, there have been over 40 disruptions in train services. Vandals
> had broken into SMRT train depot to vandalise the trains on two occasions,
> raising concerns of security. SMRT has never taken responsibility for any of
> these failures. In fact, SMRT has tried to shift the blame to the security
> company when they were questioned for the security lapse in their depot.

To appease public anger, the government immediately created a committee to
probe the disruptions in train service. Political Writings suggests some
[questions](http://politicalwritings.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/survivor-mrt-
island/) for the committee

> The Committee of Inquiry is to establish the cause of the incident, ie who
> created the physical conditions that led to the incident. Who did not follow
> procedure, who did not perform the necessary maintenance, was the
> maintenance regime adequate and in line with manufacturers’ recommendations
> to begin with, were we running the system beyond it’s design load and/or
> design frequency, etc.

Reinventing the Rice Bowl thinks
[competition](http://sonofadud.com/2011/12/21/thoughts-on-the-smrt-fiasco/)
will be good for SMRT

> While it may be impractical to have two MRT operators on the same line we
> can certainly have independent bus operators who compete with the train
> operators and are not part of the same monopoly. Hopefully they would then
> be able to respond much faster to the current shortfall in service on the
> MRT network. More competition would also be likely to lead to greater
> investment and a better travel experience for commuters.

[Desparatebeep](http://desparatebeep.blogspot.com/2011/12/who-gives-shit-at-
christmas-about-plebs.html) questions the financial priorities of the train
company

> Well, I'm not going to go into the financial statements of the transport
> opperators but what's clear is that the money which seemed to flow to the
> senior management and majority shareholders didn't flow into simple routine
> checks that could have saved people a lot of agravation and trauma.

My Singapore News is worried that [fare
hikes](http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.com/2011/12/train-breakdown-is-going-
to-be-costly.html) will be proposed soon to improve the quality of train
service

> The second point is equipment failure and more maintenance. More maintenance
> and servicing, more frequent change of equipment means more cost. You just
> cannot have more servicing and maintenance without having more technicians.
>
> Whatever the outcome, commuter pockets gonna be burnt a big hole. It is
> going to be costly to the commuters as the profits must still go up and up.

The Blue Sweater believes that the [profit-
driven](http://thebluesweater.blogspot.com/2011/12/system-off-rails.html) SMRT
is not compatible with its public-oriented mission

> While the profit-motive is arguably a contributing factor in the crisis, as
> necessary expenses (such as personnel and maintenance) are driven down with
> consequences, another reason could be that the profit-driven ethos of the
> corporation is at odds with the public-oriented mission it is supposed to
> serve.
>
> I’m not calling for the re-nationalisation of our public transport, but it
> does raise questions about the promises of privatisation and
> corporatisation, and forces us to re-think the balance between private
> management and government regulation.

Encountering Urbanization hopes the debates will foster more
[dialogue](http://encounteringurbanization.wordpress.com/2011/12/17/singapore-
efficient-vs-resilient-city/) between government and the people

> Additionally while these disruptions are certainly inconvenient I must admit
> it is also refreshing to see so much discussion among friends, colleagues
> and across the Internet about the role of public servants and public
> agencies in a place that has been dubbed a “nanny state” for taking care of
> its citizens. Perhaps these disruptions and people’s anger can help shape
> the evolving dialogue in Singapore between the government and the people.
> After all a more resilient city needs not just resilient infrastructure but
> also resilient and engaged citizens that help create innovative solutions to
> benefit their city.

Singapore Recalcitrant criticizes the SMRT
[management](http://singaporerecalcitrant.blogspot.com/2011/12/smrt-
debacle.html)

> The frequency in the number of breakdowns in services does not convey
> confidence in the commuting public nor does it reflect well on the
> efficiency or the lack of it in the management. One or two breakdowns should
> have forewarned the management of possible flaws in the system and that
> efforts should have been made to detect these defects and rectify them.
> Complacency seems to be the order of the day and nothing seems to have
> changed the frequency of disruptions.
