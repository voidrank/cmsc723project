December 10th is Human Rights Day, and this year's topic is Non Discrimination
and today we bring you a small selection of some of the videos people have
made and uploaded to sustain this Human Right.

In the [words of Secretary General Ban Ki-
moon:](http://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/2009/)

> Discrimination targets individuals and groups that are vulnerable to attack:
> the disabled, women and girls, the poor, migrants, minorities, and all those
> who are perceived as different.
>
> … But these victims of discrimination are not alone. The United Nations is
> standing with them, committed to defending the rights of all, and
> particularly the most vulnerable. That is our identity and our mission.”

From Venezuela, some College students [made a short
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16xyjtIW8As) to raise awareness of the
topic and promote non-discrimination for kids between 12 and 18 years of age:

From Mexico, with the support of different organizations, [a spot was made
against discrimination](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H04ABKs9_JM) based on
ethnicity:

In Argentina, a group of teens [made a claymation
short](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v836oPe_poE) discussing discrimination
against different urban “tribes” with which teens identify such as “Floggers”
(foto bloggers), emos/goths and “cumbieros” (who listen to cumbia).

And from the US a couple decided to take the opportunity during Human Rights
Day to make others aware [through a
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTTBQvvflMw) about another type of
discrimination taking place in Uganda, where a proposed bill would allegedly
make it possible for someone to be convicted and given the death penalty just
for being homosexual, and it could impose fines and other penalties to their
families or landlords:
