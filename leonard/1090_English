Many organisations working to preserve global cultural heritage – both
tangible and intangible – have been using online media to support their
efforts.

On October 6, the World Monument Fund (WMF) [published the 2010 world monument
watch list](http://www.wmf.org/watch/project-map) plotting the dozens of
villages, buildings, bridges and monuments at risk of destruction on an
interactive Google map. The WMF in New York is one of many organizations, like
[Global Heritage Fund](http://www.globalheritagefund.org/home.html), [World
Heritage Center](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list) (part of UNESCO), financing
projects to preserve world cultural heritage sites.

**Becoming a heritage site  
**

While a nomination for cultural heritage site or monument can be a useful step
on the way to acquiring funds for preservation, an additional benefit can be a
general rise in tourism to the sites in question. Moreover, the nomination
often stimulates national or local pride.

Singaporean university lecturer _Tan Wee Cheng_ created [a Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=44978823543), asking for
Singapore sites to be included on the World Heritage list:

> As at the end of Dec 08, there are 878 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 145
> countries but none in Singapore. Are there really no sites in Singapore
> worthy of such an honour? I have visited a few hundred WHS round the world
> and am convinced that certain sites in Singapore deserve to be listed, for
> they do posses what UNESCO calls sites with “outstanding universal value”.

Conflicts can also help influence decisions. After the violent clashes between
ethnic Uighurs (Uyghurs) and Chinese Hans in Kashgar, the ancient [Silk
Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road) city, [a petition had been
submitted online](http://www.petitiononline.com/kashgar/petition.html) to
claim World Heritage Status for the city, threatened to be demolished.

**Man is a threat**

Humans themselves are almost always the source of the dangers, as [this
article](http://www.teachingexpertise.com/articles/world-heritage-examining-
the-threats-1776) written by _Dr. Anjana Khatwa_ , education coordinator for
the [Jurassic Coast World Heritage](http://www.jurassiccoast.com/), points
out:

> Threats to World Heritage Sites come in many forms: armed conflict and war,
> wanton destruction, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, unplanned
> construction and uncontrolled tourism.

This idea is shared by WMF President _Bonnie Burnham_ in her address for the
launch of the [2008 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered
Sites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_World_Monuments_Watch_List_of_Most_Endangered_Sites):

> On this list, man is indeed the real ennemy. But, just as we caused the
> damage in the first place, we have the power to repair it, by taking our
> responsibility as caretakers of the world’s cultural heritage seriously. So
> today we are sounding the alarm, using the World Monuments Watch List to
> demonstrate, through the vivid examples of beloved places around the world,
> the importance of working together to meet these challenges and join forces
> to protect our world’s shared architectural heritage.

**Innovating answers**

Since 2003, UNESCO has also been working to [safeguard Intangible Cultural
Heritage](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&pg=home) like
languages, dances, and handcraft techniques. New technologies and the Internet
could be a necessary breakthrough in preventing some cultural and intangible
heritage from vanishing.

[CyArk](http://archive.cyark.org/about), a non-profit entity, is working on
the “500 Challenge”. This project intends to make a digital model of cultural
heritage sites by laser scanning, to create an open archive of the data.

The [World Intellectual Property Organization](http://www.wipo.int/about-
wipo/en/what_is_wipo.html) (WIPO) also has a project to preserve and protect
oral and intangible heritage, [Creative Heritage Project: IP Guidelines for
Documenting, Recording and Digitizing Intangible Cultural
Heritage](http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/folklore/culturalheritage/):

> New technologies provide communities with fresh opportunities to document
> and digitize expressions of their traditional cultures, meeting the strong
> desire of communities to preserve, promote and pass on their cultural
> heritage to succeeding generations.

This is a credo shared by Malian blogger _Boukary Konate_ , [in talking about
African folk tales](http://fasokan.maneno.org/bam/articles/vdd1247776495/) [in
Bambara] on his personal blog, _Fasokan_ :

> Bi bi in na, an bɛɛ bɛ k’a kɔlɔsi sisan k’o ko ninnu bɛ ka ban dɔɔni dɔɔni.
> N kɛlen kɔ ka n yɛrɛ ɲininkan, ye jaabi min sɔrɔ, o de ye ka u sɛbɛen an ka

We all observe their disappearance, and after thinking about it a lot, i found
the solution: to write them down in our language, to translate them in another
languages, then keep them on the Internet. It will prevent them from
disappearing and allow other people to learn about them.
