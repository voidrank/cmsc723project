in Singapore and south Malaysia! They blame it on the burning of trees in
Sumatra, Indonesia where farmers are preparing for the crop planting season.
The Singapore government describes it as a “transboundary haze situation
arising from the land and forest fires in Sumatra.”

Hundreds of [Malaysian schools](http://indosnesos.blogspot.com/2010/10/haze-
pollution-from-indonesia-forces.html) were ordered closed because of the haze.
Health authorities are reporting a spike in respiratory illnesses. Below is
the October 21 update and [advisory from
Singapore](http://app2.nea.gov.sg/news_detail_2010.aspx?news_sid=20101022475142591106)

> The smoke haze situation has worsened since yesterday
>
> The latest satellite pass today detected 6 hotspots in southern Sumatra.
> Hazy conditions are expected to persist as the prevailing winds will
> continue to bring smoke haze from Sumatra to Singapore.
>
> In view of the current haze situation, persons who feel unwell are advised
> to consult their doctors. Those with existing heart or respiratory ailments
> are also advised to reduce physical exertion and outdoor activities.

Since it is a regional problem in Southeast Asia, the _[ASEAN Haze
Online](http://haze.asean.org/index.php)_ was established to monitor the
situation. A Facebook page, _[Haze-Free
Singapore](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Haze-Free-Singapore/150713998305853)_
, was created encouraging netizens to post pictures and reports.

_Singapore-Lighthouse_ wonders about the [funding](http://singapore-
lighthouse.blogspot.com/2010/10/haze-and-politics-between-singapore-and.html)
given by the Singapore government to assist Indonesia in helping prevent the
spread of forest fires

> As I was typing this blog, I was coughing like hell and was in a bad shape.

> So how much money was given to Indonesia to keep their forest or really how
> much ended up in the pocket of the Indonesian officials? Can we really buy

website-down/comment-page-1/#comment-165243) doubts the effectiveness of
ministerial meetings to stop the haze

> Every year for many years already, we have the haze. All these Asean

>
> Inspite of the health hazard and economic impact due to the haze, there has
> been little or no improvement to the situation.

> Asean countries are just too ‘polite’ and lack the will power to resolve the
> issue.

> You could almost SMELL it.

> Besides the reduced visibility which greets you as you step out of your air-

[Noel Boyd](http://www.noelboyd.com/2010/10/god-damn-
haze.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) describes the haze
situation in Singapore

> Seriously what's up with the haze? I was in Orchard Road yesterday for most
> part of the day and the haze was really bad! Singapore just looked so gloomy
> and it sure smelt like Singapore was on fire. And at night, we could hardly
> see the moon!
>
> If you aren't from Singapore, I would like to assure you that this country
> isn't on fire. The haze is from the forest fires in the Riau Province of
> Sumatra, Indonesia. That's 894 kilometers away from Singapore!
