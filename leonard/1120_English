This has been a very difficult week in [Puerto
Rico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico): governor Luis Fortuño [layed-
off nearly
17,000](http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/internacional/20090926/anuncian-
despido-de-16470-trabajadores_38091_63642.html) government employees. In total
this year, the recently elected government has laid off around 25,000 public
employees. After the announcement, [people immediately
mobilized](http://www.claridadpuertorico.com/content.html?news=0C7D716E304856266F987C1B8828E149).
Workers, women, [students,
professors](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dialogodigital/sets/72157622365524855/show/),
and members of the civil society in general, have organized press conferences
and demonstrations in order to protest the decision that leaves thousands of
families in a desperate situation. In an act of [civil
disobedience](http://www.claridadpuertorico.com/content.html?news=0C7D716E304856266F987C1B8828E149)
a group of people chained themselves and blocked the main entrance to the
Governor's Mansion, La Fortaleza, in Old San Juan. They set up what they
called “The Camp of Dignity”, but were soon removed by a special police force.
Trade unions have announced a national strike for October 15.

There have also been acts of utter frustration. While leading a [press
conference](http://www.wapa.tv/noticias/primeraplana/%C2%A1-lanzan-huevo-al-
gobernador--/20090929113315) in the eastern zone of the Island, the Governor
was [egged ](http://www.wapa.tv/noticias/locales/¡-lanzan-huevo-al-
gobernador--/20090929113315)by a man called Roberto García. The Governor
dodged the egg. García was charged on attempted assault and was set free on
bail. He later said that even though he had voted for the Governor, he was
extremely disappointed by his decision to lay off thousands of government
employees. Women's organizations have
[denounced](http://mujeresenpr.blogspot.com/2009/10/piden-fortuno-que-
reconsidere-casos-de.html) the lay-offs, saying that they disproportionately
affect women, especially single mothers who are the only bread-winners of
their families.

Comments and analysis on the precarious political, social and economic
situation that Puerto Rico is enduring have flooded the blogosphere. Sergio
Marxuach, Policy Director of the [Center for the New
Economy](http://grupocne.org/), a nonprofit think-tank dedicated to
progressive economic solutions based in Puerto Rico, analyzed the situation in
the organization's new [blog](http://cneblog.grupocne.org/) [ES]:

Todos los economistas están de acuerdo que el resultado de despedir 20,000
empleados públicos en una recesión va a tener los siguientes efectos: 1.
Aumentar la tasa de desempleo a mas de 18%;  
2\. Agudizar la recesión, ya que habrá 20,000 empleados menos, lo que reduce
el consumo agregado;  
3\. Aumentar la demanda por servicios públicos, por ejemplo, educación y
salud;  
4\. Desempleo prolongado ya que el sector privado no va a reclutar masivamente
en medio de una recesión; y  
5\. En el caso específico de Puerto Rico, empeorar la situación los bancos, ya
que 46% de los empleados públicos tienen hipoteca.

El partido de gobierno está de plácemes, no tiene oposición y los medios de
comunicación son de manufactura conservadora, lo que le ayuda enormemente ya
que los inversionistas de los medios son parientes de los ejecutivos de
empresas que se beneficiarán del mantengo corporativo de la ley de Alianzas
Público Privadas, mediante la cual le transferirán no solo la responsabilidad
de los servicios públicos que hagan falta ofrecer ante la eliminación de las
agencias de gobierno sino la administración de fondos públicos que antes
correspondían a esas dependencias gubernamentales.

In her blog [Poder, espacio y ambiente](http://poderyambiente.blogspot.com/)
[ES], lawyer Erika Fontánez questioned the reasons the Government offered in
order to justify the lay-offs. Government officials said the cuts would
ultimately benefit the population.

Necesitamos saber, por ejemplo, si variables como el género y los puestos que
tradicionalmente responden a un género particular fueron tomadas en cuenta.
¿Sabemos cuantas de esas 17,000 son mujeres? ¿Cuántas madres solteras? ¿A
cuanto asciende el % de mujeres desempleadas? ¿De qué sectores son? ¿Cuál es
el costo de que más personas se queden eventualmente sin plan médico que cubra
los servicios de salud? ¿Cuál es el número de los costos vs. los beneficios en
atender más problemas de salud mental, del aumento en suicidios, de seguridad,
de personas que se vean en el riesgo de perder sus viviendas y tengan que
acudir a solicitar vivienda pública, lo que también está en el colapso?
Números, sí, queremos números.

also offered his insights in [(Trans)actions:

> Part of the measures to cut back on government spending have included:

> suspension of previously negotiated collective bargaining agreements, and
