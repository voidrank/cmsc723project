On December 18, 2008, millions of Thai mobile phone subscribers got this text
message from the newly installed Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva:

> “ผมนายกรัฐมนตรีคนใหม่ ขอเชิญท่านร่วมนำประเทศไทยออกจากวิกฤติ
> สนใจได้รับการติดต่อจากผมกรุณาส่งรหัสไปรษณีย์ 5 หลักของท่านมาที่เบอร์ 9191 (3
> บ.)”

“I, the new Prime Minister, invites you to bring Thailand out of the crisis.
Interested to get contact from me, please send your 5-digits postcode to the
number 9191 (3 Baht)”

If a subscriber replies, a sound clip of PM Abhisit will be delivered to
subscriber's phone,
[saying](http://th.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081217221358AANnYBd):

> “I, Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Prime Minister, realized that you fellow citizens
> are suffering, and are under stress. Therefore, I'll concentrate in exerting
> all my knowledge and ability to help the country. But I can't succeed if
> Thai people are not together in harmony. So I beg you all a chance.”

sms from the PM

According to Democrat Party officer, [the text messaging was an idea of
Abhisit himself,](http://hilight.kapook.com/view/32095) and was coordinated by
Korn Chatikavanij, the country's Finance Minister. Korn allegedly called
Thailand's three major mobile phone operators, AIS, DTAC, and True, for a
cooperation to send out the message to their subscribers. The meeting for
cooperation was held in December 16, one day before Abhisit Vejjajiva got
officially appointed to be the Prime Minister. And the reason for requesting
for 5-digits postcode is to evaluate the demographic of those who replied. The
subscribers will then be listed in a database.

Sending a text message to a person without the person's consent is considered
a violation of a consumer's privacy rights, [said consumer rights advocate
Saree Ongsomwang.](http://news.sanook.com/politic/politic_330795.php) She said
Abhisit should opt to keep contacts with the people via television and other
public communication outlets [in order to avoid infringing on the consumer's
rights.](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30091357)

Saree, who is also part of the committee of the Telecommunication Consumer
Protection Institute, added that under Thai telecommunication law, mobile
phone operators are not allowed to release the list of subscribers without
their consent. When the three mobile operators sent the controversial text
message to their subscribers, free of charge, in behalf of the Prime Minister
or the Democrat Party, it brought some legal and political complications.

Under the [1999 Anti-Corruption Law](http://bit.ly/a0gP90) (amended 2007),
state officers, including cabinet members, [cannot receive any gift or benefit
that is worth more than 3,000 Baht.](http://bit.ly/c4fTK6) It is estimated
that the sending of the Prime Minister's text message cost more than 10
million Baht. Abhisit could be charged in the courts, as argued by Pheu Thai
Party spokesman Prompong Nopparit, [urging the National Anti-Corruption
Commission (NACC) to investigate the
case.](http://tnews.teenee.com/politic/45297.html)

If Abhisit and Korn are found guilty, they will be impeached and suspended
from holding any political position in accordance with the Constitution.

Comments in the Internet were quite mixed at that time. In general, many
agreed that this may be a violation of privacy and personal data, and the
Prime Minister doing too much PR on media. But at the same time they feel that
if it's a good intention, it should be ok, and he should have a chance to work
for the country.

On July 16, 2010, [NACC has again postponed its ruling on the
case,](http://www.mcot.net/cfcustom/cache_page/79107.html) and did not yet set
a date for the handing down of the final decision.
