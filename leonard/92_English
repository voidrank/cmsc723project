An hour long documentary shows the traditional lives of indigenous people in
the Amazon, and how their subsistence lifestyle is threatened by petroleum
exploitation and monoculture of renewable energy sources like palm oil.

In [_Amazonia , masato o petroleo_](http://vimeo.com/24410764) (Amazon, masato
or oil) [es] we get a glimpse of the lives that Jairo, his wife Irma and their
four children lead. Waking up early to drink masato, a traditional yuca drink
that is their lifeline even when other food is scarce they set out to do their
daily work: fishing, tending their small farm and hunting.

**Threat of development**

The river and the jungle are their means of survival and now what the
government calls “development” is threatening their lives. The forest is being
cut down to build roads, mountains razed to get gravel to pave such roads that
only serve to lead to the petroleum towers and the “bio-diesel” plantations.

The indigenous communities are then left to fend for themselves as the creeks
full of fish dry up and as oil and petroleum leech out from the pumps and into
the rivers, making watering their crops, cooking food, drinking and eating
fish out of the question.

Petroleum, as much as it should look as a sign of wealth, is rather a sign of
social and cultural destructuring, contamination, sickness and death. And if
we speak about petroleum, lets also discuss bio-diesel and the thousands and
thousands of acres that are being destined to incorporate the growing of palm
oil to produce the misnamed renewable fuel.

“Amazonia, masato or petroleum” wants to show how the political and economical
powers look down on the jungle and its inhabitants, because they practice a
subsistence economy and aren't productive. It wishes to denounce the
governments politics against the indigenous people and farmers of the jungle,
considered second class citizens who are invaded, deceived and displaced from
their communities in order to hand over the resources to the great national
companies and multinationals with the main intention of satisfying the Free
Trade Agreement with the United States of America.

The documentary also shows specialists, scientists and community leaders
explaining the ways in which the indigenous community has tried to make their
rights be known and respected, and also the history of health problems in the
indigenous communities due to petroleum exploitation in the past.

The film was produced by the Catalan organisation _Lliga dels drets dels
pobles_ and more information about the film can be found [on their movie

rights is available on their site [“Indigenous, When the Land
