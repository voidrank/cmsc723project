The beautiful [Kashmir Region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir) is marred
with [territorial conflicts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict)
between India, Pakistan and China since the British colonial rulers left India
in 1947. Amidst a few wars all these countries have made claims to different
parts of Kashmir, based on historical developments and religious affiliations
of the Kashmiri people.

The [Jammu and Kashmir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir) region
is administered by India but enjoys special autonomy under Article 370 of the
Constitution of India. It is also the only Indian state that has its own flag.
Since the late 1980s a violent uprising backed by Pakistan has caused a
prolonged, bloody conflict between militants and the Indian security forces in
this region. The Indian Army in Jammu and Kashmir has been given special
powers via [Armed Forces
Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_\(Special_Powers\)_Act,_1958),
which has been widely criticized.

Kashmir is boiling over tension and rage since early June when it was revealed
that Indian security forces allegedly killed three innocent boys and claimed
they were militants. Violent protests ensued which brought part of the region
in standstill and hundreds of Kashmiri youths [were
arrested](http://www.kashmirglobal.com/content/700-kashmiri-youth-arrested-
many-detained-under-psa). _Jason Oberdorf_ at _Global Post_
[explains](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/india/100708/kashmir-india-
violence) the recent volatile situation in Jammu and Kashmir:

> Late Tuesday (July 6, 2010) night, New Delhi deployed the army to quell
> protests in Kashmir for the first time since 1990, after police bullets
> allegedly killed three more civilians, bringing the total for the month to
> 15. [..]
>
> Facebook and other social networking sites are brimming with outpourings of
> rage, bordering on hatred for India's security forces, from Kashmiri youth.

Reading reports about Kashmir may get tricky depending on the source. While a
Pakistani media would interpret the stone pelting protests with headlines such
as “[Kashmir shuts down protesting Indian occupation: Want freedom,
Pakistan](http://rupeenews.com/2010/06/13/kashmir-shuts-down-protesting-
indian-occupation-want-freedom-pakistan/)“, an Indian media would label the
stone pelting as [provocations by anti-national
elements](http://news.rediff.com/column/2010/jul/14/kashmir-protests-are-fine-
not-motivated-ones.htm). There are reports that the Indian media may be
allegedly [fabricating blames](http://www.countercurrents.org/lies090710.htm).

Apart from tackling the stone throwing protesters the Indian military now
faces a new form of insurgency. Protesters are increasingly using social media
tools like Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, hi5, Orkut and [Kashmir
Friend](http://www.kashmirfriend.com/), which is a social network dedicated to
the people of Kashmir. _Simantik Dowerah_ at _Live Mint_
[reports](http://www.livemint.com/2010/07/07184209/Fling-it-on-
Facebook.html?h=A1) that “there are actually groups of Kashmiri stone throwers
who have registered themselves on Facebook.” _The Kashmir_
[reports](http://thekashmir.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/hidden-facebook-
instigators-they-dont-want-a-peaceful-valley/) with screenshots how the youths
are being instigated by sharing Jihadi videos.

As the violence escalated, the Jammu and Kashmir Government [banned the SMS
service](http://www.thehindu.com/news/article492195.ece) across the valley in
an attempt to stop the flow of information and rumors. But the Kashmiris could
breathe free, stay connected and share information via Facebook as Hindustan
Times [reported](http://www.hindustantimes.com/rssfeed/srinagar/Stifled-
Kashmir-breathes-free-on-Facebook/Article1-571831.aspx). Many news websites
like _Kashmir Dispatch_ and _Kashmir_ are using Facebook to reach netizens.

Amidst all this there are reports that Facebook users [are being
screened](http://www.risingkashmir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24924&Itemid=1)
by Police. _The Daily Rising Kashmir_
[reports](http://www.risingkashmir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24924&Itemid=1)
that the authorities have now started scrutinizing Facebook users in South
Kashmir's [Anantnag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anantnag_District)
(previously Islamabad) district who they claim are ‘instigating’ people
against the state.

_Sagar_ From Srinagar [writes in
protest](http://tragedyoferrorsmykashmir.blogspot.com/2010/07/i-protest.html)
in his blog “Tragedy Of Errors: My Kashmir”, which sums up the pain of the
Kashmiris:

> I protest for the incompetency of the people handling my future, I protest
> for the lack of humanity in our (in)security forces, I Protest for the
> repeated insults, I protest for media using my pain for their TRPs, I
> protest for the short sightedness of all our leaders, I protest for none of
> them coming out submissively and asking for forgiveness, I protest for being
> ordered to be locked up in my house for no fault of mine, I protest for
> anyone, but never a Kashmiri, getting his 5 minutes of fame on tv, I protest
> for the unnecessary and insensitive comments made about my place, I protest
> for journalists telling the world just one side of the story…

_Being Cynical_ at _Desicritics_
[blames](http://desicritics.org/2010/07/08/070716.php) the policies and
politics as a reason for the protests:

> Traditionally Kashmiris feel alienated- thanks to our policies and our
> politician's attitude to keep the Kashmir topic alive for their own gain. If
> you look at the video footage, it is really disturbing to see teenagers
> barely in their twenties are hurling stones at the security forces. On a
> micro analysis you would realize that these are the same guys who would have
> born when Kashmir was at peak of it's boiling point and their whole life
> till now has gone through violence, atrocities, negligence, no governance
> and of course the terrorists. [..]
>
> I am sure the majority of these teenagers who are seen protesting violently
> might not be knowing for what they are protesting or on whom they are
> pelting stones.

Some [analysts are labeling](http://sify.com/news/is-kashmir-stone-pelting-
the-new-intifada-news-national-khomucgjhjj.html) these protests as the ‘new
Intifada’. _Arjimand Hussain Talib_ at _Dateline Srinagar_
[opines](http://arjimandtalib.blogspot.com/2010/07/kashmirs-new-enemy-
powerpoint.html) about the protests of Kashmiri youths:

> Their movement will not die down because this generation is dynamic –
> stretches across the globe. It has technology at its hand – Internet,
> mobiles phones, digital cameras, You Tube, Facebook, etc. They are archiving
> Kashmir’s current happenings for the next generation. And are disseminating
> that to the world beyond to catch attention.

There are
[reports](http://www.ifex.org/india/kashmir/2010/07/14/lockdown_slain/) that
the local government is trying to control the flow of information by shutting
down publications and confiscating newspapers prior to distribution.
Journalists are being barred from reporting on demonstrations. The world will
rely on Facebook and Twitter users for first hand reports from the region. But
after the SMS ban will the Jammu and Kashmir government crack down on Social
networks too?
