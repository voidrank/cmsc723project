Last week, a strange construction appeared at [Blaha Lujza
Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaha_Lujza_t%C3%A9r_\(Budapest_Metro\))
in Budapest. The work of _Téreltérítés Munkacsoport_ (‘Deviant Space Working
Group’) was connected to the capital's public space and art festival, called
[Placcc](http://en.placcc.hu/). The construction – “[Downtown Smog Reducing
Station](http://en.placcc.hu/red_menu/events.html)” – was created following
the plans of [Richard Buckminster
Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller), and united several
ideas about urban environment.

András Földes of _Képgyár_
[blog](http://kepgyar.blog.hu/2009/10/10/a_blaha_lujza_teri_algak_erdemlik_a_nobel_bekedijat)
(‘Image Factory’, HUN) reported:

> It could be known about the luminous igloo mounted at Blaha Lujza Square
> that it was the work of young artists and architects, and it cleans the
> smoggy air by biological means. Which is a noble goal, polluted air is bad
> after all, clean air is very healthy on the other hand. But still, the
> euphoria around the futuristic construction was surprising at first. […]

According to the
[website](http://en.placcc.hu/red_menu/events/terelterites.html) of Placcc
festival:

> Although the group includes future architects, they felt it was important to
> approach space from other aspects, not only and exclusively an architectural
> point of view, therefore they explore the relationship of man and space
> through art in public space. The starting point of the work they are making
> for PLACCC Festival is the belief that we are not mere observers of (public)
> space, but can actively shape it and participate in its transformation.

András Földes asked the leader of _Téreltérítés Munkacsoport_ about the
functioning of the so-called ‘smog reducer':

> […] The leader of the project and [university] professor, _Antal Lakner_ ,
> explained ardently the functioning principles of the algae filtration bio-
> catalyzer, adding after each of his sentence that this thing really worked,
> that it wasn't just an object of art.
>
> “Here an artist, an architect, a biologist and a technician worked together
> to resolve an existing problem,” said Lakner, a Hungarian Algae working
> helmet on his head. “A detecting car came here, and demonstrated that the
> plantation produced a significant amount of oxygen,” he said as he looked
> lovingly over the glass bubble occupied with silent oxygen production.
