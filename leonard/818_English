Late last year a group of U.K. citizens launched a simple campaign to end the
detention of children and babies by immigration authorities. The campaign,
called [End Child Detention Now](http://www.ecdn.org) (ECDN), has since been
backed by some high-profile British figures and the group has quickly gathered
names for its [petition](http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/NoChildDetention/)
to the U.K. government, nearly 4,600 at the time of writing. In February, I
joined the group to help with online campaigning.

The U.K. is the only European country to detain children of asylum seekers
without a time limit: around 2000 each year, some for months at a time. Other
countries have already taken action — Australia, for example, has pledged
never to put another child in a detention center.

The ECDN volunteer-led campaign is also raising awareness of cases where
children are treated like adults when they are actually under 18. This month,
a 14-year-old boy from Afghanistan, ‘M’ (name protected for legal reasons),
was mistaken for an adult, arrested and was about to be deported from the
U.K., before a judge ordered his release, pending a full judicial review
hearing [pictured above, with his elder brother].

Writing [on the Web site
OpenDemocracy](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/clare-sambrook/take-
one-traumatised-child-classify-as-adult-arrest-lock-up-and-bundle-ont)
campaign co-coordinator Clare Sambrook shares M's story, as well as that of
17-year-old Rima, who fled religious persecution in Eritrea. Expanding on
Rima's story she says:

> Rima fled, moved from house to house, lived rough until twelve months ago
> when Alison and Robert took her in as their natural daughter. In May last
> year Rima was seized and locked up in Dungavel, a former prison.
>
> When Rima’s solicitor lodged an application for judicial review, the Border
> Agency swept her out of its range, taking her 356 miles south by caged van
> to Yarl’s Wood, Serco’s notorious Bedfordshire detention centre. Another
> application for review, deportation averted. After seven days in Yarl’s Wood
> Rima was home again.
>
> And then, last month, the day after Valentine’s Day, the government told
> Rima she would be forcibly deported to Italy within weeks. The family
> campaigns vigorously for clemency, fearing that each new dawn will bring the
> Border Agency’s arrest squad to their door.

Sambrook goes on to say:

> “M’s fate and Rima’s hang in the balance — here, in Britain, a country where
> asking for sanctuary is a right, not a crime, and where, according to the
> government, every child matters.”

Other projects are also trying to put pressure on the government to address
the problems surrounding the detention of children.

NCADC (the National Coalition of Anti-Deportion Campaigns), for example, also
raised the case of ‘M’, [with ideas for further
action](http://www.ncadc.org.uk/NCADC-Campaigns/MashalJabari.html).

The organisation [Medical Justice](http://www.medicaljustice.org.uk/index.php)
is calling upon doctors to raise their concerns about the issue. In its
[petition for doctors](http://www.gopetition.co.uk/petitions/stop-the-
administrative-detention-of-children-and-families.html), it says:

> “The administrative detention of children is damaging to them, cannot be
> made otherwise, and is unacceptable in a civilised society. We call for the
> immediate cessation of this practice which is demonstrably and permanently
> harmful to children’s health, both in the short and long term.”

Other related groups include the [Bail for Immigration
Detainees](http://www.biduk.org/ "Bail for Immigration Detainees") and
[Citizens for Sanctuary](http://www.citizensforsanctuary.org.uk/ " A CITIZEN
Organising Foundation campaign to secure justice for people fleeing
persecution and rebuild public support for sanctuary.").

So far, there has been a lot of [mainstream press attention to the
issue](http://delicious.com/tag/ecdn2010), following the publication of a
recent report. ECDN hopes that bloggers and social media users will
increasingly engage with the issue too. The campaign can be followed on
[@stop_child_det](http://twitter.com/stop_child_det) on Twitter and has a
[Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=139016764791).
