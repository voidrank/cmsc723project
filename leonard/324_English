Tweeps, reporters and netizens are investigating the possibility that Yemen's
security forces may have used nerve gas when they attacked protesters on
Tuesday, March 8. The
[attack](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/09/yemen-saleh-declares-war-
on-yemen-videos/), which government later said was to prohibit Yemeni
tribesman from bringing weapons to the student sit-in protesters who have
gathered near Sanaa University calling for the resignation of long-serving
leader Ali Abdullah Saleh.

One protester [reportedly](http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=92157)
died in that attack, and up to 70 were injured. Protesters
[say](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-
east/110309/yemen-violence-protests-sanaa-nerve-gas) that security forces also
used what they thought was tear gas to disperse the crowd. However, a few
doctors treating the injured
[said](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/anti-government-protesters-
may-have-been-hit-with-nerve-gas-doctors-say/story-e6frg6so-1226018936417)
they had never seen these
[symptoms](http://www.yementimes.com/defaultdet.aspx?SUB_ID=35731) with people
affected by tear gas, including convulsions, loosing muscular control and even
paralysis.

Here's a tweet from local reporter Jeb Boone:

And from reporter Iona Craig, who was present at the hospital with injured
protesters.

The Chemical Weapons Convention
[outlaws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention#Key_organizations_of_member_states)
the production, stockpoling and use of various chemical weapons, including
nerve agents. Presently, 165 countries have signed the United Nation's
convention including Yemen, which
[ratified](http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-3&chapter=26&lang=en)
it in 2000.

Oliver Holmes, a freelance reporter based in Yemen, provided a video of a
grenade found at the scene:

He asked via Twitter:

Holmes then reported:

Here's a video of more of the ammunition found after the March 8 attacks.

A Tweep responds:

This is not the first time Yemen's government has been accused of using nerve
gas. In 2005, reporter Jane Novak [
published](http://www.middleeasttransparent.com/old/texts/jane_novak_chemical_weapons_drug_smuggling_in_yemen.htm)
claims from people on the ground that the country's military may have used
nerve gas to quash the [Houthis rebellion in
Sahdaa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%27dah_insurgency).

> Highly respected religious scholar Mohamed Almansour wrote a letter to
> President Saleh in March 2005 which stated, “We condemn all things that
> happened in the previous months such as excessive use of force by the
> Government forces and the use of internationally prohibited weapons.” In
> May, Alquds Alarabia reported that rebel leader Abdelmalik al-Houthi said,
> “The government attacked us with internationally prohibited weapons like
> chlorine gas that caused an inability to breathe.” He also referred to
> “colored gas.” An article in the opposition newspaper al-Shoura in June
> listed the names of imprisoned children, including Bader Aldeen Abdula
> Moslih who was described as “12 years old, very ill from nervous system and
> skin damage as a result of chlorine gas used by the army in the first war
> last year.” In an internet interview the same month, a Houthi partisan and
> purported eye witness described “some special missile which turns into many
> particles, yellow and then red. The cloud goes up slowly. When it explodes
> it is yellow, when the particles come down they are red.” The cloud caused
> an inability to breathe, he reported.

> Yahya al-Houthi, former Member of Parliament in the ruling party and brother
> of slain rebel leader Hussain al-Houthi, wrote in an email: “Most of the
> injured persons have died especially those who were hiding in Suleiman Cave.
> They were exposed to chemical gasâ€¦The area surrounding Suleiman Cave is

In lengthy reports on the conflict, neither the [International Crisis
Group](http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/iran-
gulf/yemen/086-yemen-defusing-the-saada-time-bomb.aspx) or
[IRIN](http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=79410) mentioned these
assertions.

Some Tweeps continue the claim of government use of some gas agent on Tuesday
night.

Other Tweeps find it difficult to sort out the facts.
