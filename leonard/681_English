have a good chance to move on to the second round.

Despite the punctual allegations of fraud, the overall sentiment is that of
relief and satisfaction that the polls were done without any turmoil so far
and[ a remarkable voters turnout

presidentielle-cour-supremela-proclamation-des-resultats-de-la-presidentielle-
prevue-ce-mardi.html)[fr]. There was also an important increase in online
media conversation related to the elections. Bloggers have addressed several
topics from the fraud allegations that have surfaced, the peaceful proceedings
and the concern that ethnicity might have driven most of the voters’ choice.

The authorities also revealed yesterday that theyhave uncovered a plot to
destabilize the second round of voting (source: [VOA
News](http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Guinea-Authorities-Uncover-
Plot-to-Disturb-Presidential-Election-98750929.html) and [BBC
Afrique](http://www.bbc.co.uk/french/news/story/2010/07/100718_guinee_troubles.shtml)
[fr] ).

Fraud was discussed at length within the Guinean blogosphere, even prior to
the first round poll. _Guinee58_ posts a [sample of the
ballot](http://www.guinee58.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1916:exemple-

___Laura Hirahara at_ Impunity watch provides [a context about the fraud
allegations](http://impunitywatch.com/?p=12947) and the confirmed ones:

> The first round of voting on July 27th, in which 77 percent of registered
> Guinea voters took part, occurred without violence. However, since the
> results were announced by Guinea’s Supreme Court, many of the 24 candidates
> that did not make the run-off have made official complaints of voter fraud.
> The electoral commission charged with investigating voting irregularities
> has confirmed “many cases of fraud,” in addition to the claims being made.

Details of frauds in a few cities in North Guinea were reported online. In
Faranah et de Siguiri, the [following
allegations](http://www.guinee58.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1994:fraude-
electorale-a-faranah-et-a-siguiri&catid=45:analyses&Itemid=81) were made [fr]:

> A Faranah, le chef du quartier a été surpris en train de voter au Bureau N°
> 346, avec 75 (Soixante quinze) cartes d’électeurs subtilisées. Ensuite, dans

> des résultats sont arrivés dans la salle, sans enveloppes sécurisées.

In Faranah, the head of the community was found to have voted with 75 stolen
electoral registrations in the bureau N 346. Then, in the urban borough of
Siguiri, the administrative commission of ballot collection could only count 2
out of 71 offices. The rest of the results arrived in the counting room
without sealed envelopes.

charges of registration card
fabrication](http://www.actuguinee.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=632&Itemid=83)
[fr]:

A merchant named Diallo Sadakadji and his son were arrested on June 30 2010 at
their home in Kaporo on the borough of Ratoma under the charge of printing and
distributing about one million false voter registration cards.

Les _Electeurs Testeurs_ would like to go beyond the allegations of fraud and
wonder what [the second round means for the future of Guinea as they going
forward ](http://guinee50.blogs.france24.com/article/2010/07/07/au-dela-des-
fraudes-quelles-seraient-les-raisons-profondes-des-agissem-0)[fr]:

For the rest now, it seems the voting according to ethnic identity will not
work anymore. One will have to make alliances. Therefore, only objectivity can
guide the choice of the other ethnicities, especially the young ones as they
will select between one of the two candidates left for the second round of the
presidential elections.

Les _Electeurs Testeurs_ discuss further ethnocentrism as a factor in the
electoral vote and argues that it was overblown in the media and that
[Guineans were able to look past ethnic considerations

Contrary to the image portrayed in the media in which a reconciliation in
Guinea was an utopia, we saw a different Guinea as these campaigns came to an
end. Guineans surprised the candidates and put ethnic cleavage behind them.
There was one unfortunate incident that troubled the peaceful scene yesterday.
I was an isolate incident and the national interest prevailed. Guinea is and
will always be one big family.

The non-violent atmosphere was a welcome sight everywhere given the incident
of the years passed. Journalists agree this was an important step. Journalist
_Souleymane Diallo_ [opines via the blog _Guinea
Oye_](http://guineaoye.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/guinea-counts-votes-with-
relief-after-peaceful-poll/):

Every Guineans hope that patience and reason will prevail as the results of
the first round are posted. One electoral observer offers the [following take
on the election proceedings so
far](http://guineaoye.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/carter-center-election-
