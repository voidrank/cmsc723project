In the last weeks the Argentinean media made an extensive coverage about the
disappearance of the Pomar family. On November 14, Fernando Pomar, his wife
Gabriela Viagrán, and their two children Candelaria and Pilar were travelling
by car to the city of Pergamino, located 220 Km. away from Buenos Aires, and
went missing after passing a toll.

Both police and media made various hypothesis about the missing family, many
of which accused the father, Fernando Pomar, as the responsible and possible
murder.

On December 8 the car was found near Pergamino city, flipped over at the side
of a road. All family members were found dead, reported [newspaper _El Clarín_
[es]](http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/12/09/sociedad/s-02058152.htm). Police
stated the cause was a car accident: the car flipped when it could not make a
curve. The high pastures alongside the road might have avoided finding it
sooner.

After the finding of the police, two main topics were mainly discussed by the
Argentinean community. The first one was the inefficiency of the police. On
Twitter, under the hashtag [“#pomar”
[es]](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23pomar), one can find many opinions
about the lack of capability of the Buenos Aires province Police to solve
cases.

the impotence i feel from knowing that the institution that gives us
“security” is so corrupted and incompetent #policía #pomar

To blogger [JSK-SDE [es]](http://jsk-sde.blogspot.com/2009/12/sobre-el-asunto-
pomar.html) it is hard to believe that it took 24 days to find the car:

> Se sabe que el lugar es transitado, hay numerosos establecimientos cerca,
> que ¿nadie vio o sintió nada?. Me es muy difícil creerlo, 24 días son muchos
> días para que nadie vea ni sienta nada.

[The road to Pergamino] It is known that it is a busy place, there are
numerous establishments near by, nobody saw nor felt anything? It is difficult
to believe, 24 days is too much time for nobody to see or feel anything.

Blogs [_Soy Más de lo Mismo_
[es]](http://soymasdelomismo.blogspot.com/2009/12/nos-hicimos-pomar-ola.html)
and [_Visualmente_ [es]](http://visualmente.blogspot.com/2009/12/nadie-
salvara-estos-diarios-o-perdon-sr.html) also joined the discussion on
insecurity.

The other main topic discussed was the performance of the media. Both TV shows
and newspapers exposed all sorts of theories about the family. On [_Magia
Crítica_ [es]](http://criticadigital.com/magiacritica/?p=4182), Alejandro
Agostinelli talks about the media who featured “psychics” to discuss the case:

> Parapsicólogos y videntes dijeron que estaban vivos. Ufólogos hablaron de
> teleportaciones. Expertos en casos policiales se ensañaron con el padre. O
> con el padre del padre. Ahora sabemos que la familia Pomar murió en un
> accidente de tránsito.

Parapsychologists and clairvoyant said they were alive. Ufologists talked
about teletransportation. Experts on crime cases held a grudge against the
father. Or against the father of the father. Now we know that the Pomar family
died in a car accident.

On Twitter, user [Daniel Molina

> El caso Pomar es el índice de seriedad del periodismo argentino: todo lo que
> dijeron era mentira, sin atenuantes

The Pomar case is the index of seriousness of the Argentinean journalism:
everything they said was a lie, with no mitigating circumstances.

More about the coverage of the media can be found on blogs [_La Puta Pituca_
[es]](http://laputapituca.blogspot.com/2009/12/pomar.html) and [_Los
Lanzallamas_ [es]](http://textosincendiarios.blogspot.com/2009/12/el-caso-
pomar-y-el-triste-papel-de-los.html).

On [_Seguridad Vial_ [es]](http://www.cosasdeautos.com.ar/2009/12/seguridad-
vial-caso-pomar-%C2%BFun-accidente-evitable/), they prefer to draw attention
to another topic: the case will hopefully help to improve the safety policy of
the roads.

> Ojalá que estas muertes no hayan sido en vano y que ahora que el caso se

Hopefully these deaths will not be in vain and now that the case has been
solved -with a tragic end, although one that doesn't “sell”- it will not be
forgotten. Let's hope the press colleagues that wrote so much and spoke in
vain, will now fill up spaces demanding more security in the roads, something
that is never a waste of time to say.
