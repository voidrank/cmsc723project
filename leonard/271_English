In Syria, the faces of President Bashar al-Assad and his father, former
President Hafez al-Assad, are regularly seen on billboards, buildings, and in
the form of statues. Visitors to the country are often surprised by the
prevalence of such images, while Syrians have grown used to them as a daily
feature of life. Yesterday, a number of videos surfaced in which protesters
tear down the symbols of the regime: posters and statues of the ruling Assad
family.

This image of Bashar al-Assad, which I took on a visit to Tartous in 2009,
shows the years of future presidential referendum.

This video, from user [42Maher](http://www.youtube.com/user/42maher), comes
from Daraa and shows protesters demolishing a statue of Hafez al-Assad:

This video, also from Daraa, comes from
[42Maher](http://www.youtube.com/user/42maher) as well and shows a single man
tearing down a large poster of current President Bashar al-Assad, while
onlookers cheer him on:

The protests have now spread far beyond Daraa to other parts of the country.
In Homs, protesters tear down a poster of former President Hafez al-Assad

And in Arihah, close to the middle of the country, protesters chant: “Down
with Bashar al-Assad” (video from
