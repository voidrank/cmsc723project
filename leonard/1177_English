![aman and bassam](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/amanbassam.png)Two young men in New York City, Aman
Ali and Bassam Tariq, are nearing the end of their journey to document visits
to [“30 mosques in 30 days”](http://30mosques.tumblr.com/) on their blog of
the same name.

The personal project to visit and photograph the insides of mosques throughout
the holy month of [Ramadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan) (during
which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset) has even attracted the attention of
[local New York television](http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/105691/two-
men-try-for-30-mosques-in-30-days/Default.aspx).

Their [first blog entry
](http://30mosques.tumblr.com/post/171085403/day-1-the-journey-begins)on
August 22 began:

> [**Day 1: The Journey
> Begins**](http://30mosques.tumblr.com/post/171085403/day-1-the-journey-
> begins)
>
> Tonight my friend Bassam Tariq and I came up with an insanely random idea:
> What if we prayed at a different mosque every single day for the month of
> Ramadan? Hence, this Web site was born…

According to [a study at Columbia
University](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/04/09/muslims.html) there are
approximately 600,000 Muslims ~~NY1 local television, there are nearly 1
million Muslims~~ in New York City of many different cultural and ethnic
backgrounds.

It is not common for people to go to visit mosques belonging to other groups,
but Aman and Bassam (both of South Asian origin) say they have been met with
smiles and warm welcomes everywhere.

Aqsa](http://30mosques.tumblr.com/post/175990961/day-9-masjid-aqsa) **(West
African mosque in Manhattan)

> Today, I decided to stay in my neighborhood and visit Masjid Aqsa. The

> Douglas. The community is predominantly West African. It is said that this

Transcending cultural divides is not always easy.

Bassam very candidly describes his thoughts [on Day
12](http://30mosques.tumblr.com/post/178461908/day-12-masjid-tawhid-inc) when
he was presented with two mosques only blocks away from each other in
Brooklyn: a Bangladeshi mosque, and a West African one.

Being South Asian, the Bangladeshi mosque would have been the easier option,
but with the added encouragement of a friend, he decided on the greater
personal challenge.

> … Things didn’t seem that awkward in the beginning. In fact, it was only
> when I started to wonder how the rest of the congregation perceived me that
> I began to feel uneasy. I felt like a freeloader coming in — barely eating
> the food offered to me — and then leaving abruptly afterwards . A bad
> exhibitionist, if you will. Though no one in the masjid might have felt that
> way, I wonder if anyone asked themselves, “Why didn’t he just go to the
> Bangladeshi mosque?” Maybe it’s my own insecurities that raise the question.

Ramadan ends on September 19.
