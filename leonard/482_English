Become a Cyber Scout Volunteer

The government of Thailand is recruiting young people and other internet
literate citizens to join its [‘cyber scout’ program](http://www.justice-
cyberscout.org/General/home.aspx) which will monitor the internet of “online
behavior that is deemed a threat to national security and the royal
institution.’ Although it was announced a few months ago, the first training
took place last December 20-21 at Kasetsart University.

[Saksith Saiyasombut](http://saiyasombut.wordpress.com/2010/12/18/become-a-
cyber-scout-clean-up-thailands-internet/) translates the objectives of the
project:

> 1\. To create a Cyber Scout volunteer network […] that observes […] [online]
> behavior that is deemed a threat to national security and to defend and
> protect the royal institution.
>
> 4\. To promote the moral and ethics with the help of the volunteers, to
> ensure the correct behavior, build reconciliation and awareness towards the
> use of information with regard to morality and safety of individuals in
> society.
>
> 5\. To promote and support to various sectors of society to careful and
> responsible usage of information technology.

The blogger warns that the program could worsen internet censorship in
Thailand. Today, more than [100,000
websites](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/11/08/thailand-now-
blocking-256110-websites/) are blocked by Thai authorities.

> … it is quite clear that a general trend of over-emphasizing the loyalty by
> all means and the sudden urge to protect the royal institution against a
> perceived, invisible threat. And since the internet is a quite anonymous
> place, it’s an even more frightening threat. Thus these mental and cultural
> barricades are built with the recruited man-power and the social dogma of
> loyalty – both off- and online.

> … in order to build a knowledge-based society, which the government
> eventually wants to have, you have to allow the freedom to collect the
> knowledge by yourself and not being shoved into the throat.

[Leosia](http://saiyasombut.wordpress.com/2010/12/18/become-a-cyber-scout-

> This whole process is disgusting. You start with immature and naive
> youngsters and then give them a moral superiority imperative to hunt down
> and expose anyone with an opinion.

Patrick Henry comments that it is a [high tech
version](http://www.prachatai3.info/english/node/2194?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+prachataienglish+\(Prachatai+in+English\))
of the Village Scouts which was formed to hunt down communist members in the
1970s

> Hmmm… a high tech version of the Village Scouts? You'd think this regime

> Genius mixed with Fascist tendencies, vigilantes and the “ethics” of

When the program was unveiled a few months ago, [Nicholas
Farrelly](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2010/07/02/from-village-
scouts-to-cyber-scouts/) wrote about the impact of the program on the
credibility of Thailand’s political institutions

> …it also serves to convince some people that when the time comes the Thai
> authorities will be capable of controlling the potentially huge surges of
> critical, satirical and confronting commentary that lurk over the horizon. I
> remain unpersuaded that these efforts will actually prove fit for purpose
> and may, once all is said and done, actually further undermine the
> credibility of some of Thailand’s key institutions.
