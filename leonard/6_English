International boundaries are often blurred by the processes of globalization,
but in South America some maritime borders remain contested. For instance,
Chile and Peru, neighbors that have enjoyed sustained economic development
over the past few years, remain at odds over approximately 38,000 square
kilometers of sea located along their maritime border.

Bilateral negotiations between the two countries were first held in 1980 but
no agreement was reached. In 2008, Peru took the [case to the International
Court of Justice](http://www.icj-
cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=pc&case=137&k=88)(ICJ) which, in turn,
considered the issue at a public hearing in December 2012. The ICJ is expected
to make a ruling on the dispute in mid-2013.

In the meantime, Peru continues to argue that the maritime border has not yet
been defined by any agreement, with documents signed in the 1950s only
relating to access to fishing grounds. Lima also claims that maritime limits
should run diagonally south-west from the land border.

Meanwhile, Chile argues that the maritime limits were agreed upon after the
signing of treaties in 1952 and 1954. These infer that the maritime border
should run parallel to the Equator line, an arrangement that Santiago claims
Peru has respected for the past 60 years.

Supporting the Chilean position, netizen Juan Vargas commented on [Peru this
Week](http://www.peruthisweek.com/):

> The 1952 and 1954 agreements clearly indicate and establish a Maritime
> Boundary [between Chile and Peru]. They can be found translated into English
> at: <http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/58820.pdf>”

Oscar Maúrtua de Romaña, a former Peruvian Minister of Foreign Affairs
describes the arguments of both sides in a [blog post on El
Mirador](http://elmirador.lamula.pe/2012/12/22/proceso-de-delimitacion-
maritima-entre-el-peru-y-chile/encisopress), and concludes:

> El Perú y Chile, pese a las diferencias históricas, comparten un destino
> común. Un fallo equitativo por parte del tribunal permitirá poner fin al
> “único asunto” fronterizo que genera una sombra en nuestras relaciones
> bilaterales. Resulta tranquilizador el hecho de que el presidente Humala y
> el presidente Piñera, 72 horas antes de iniciarse la fase oral hayan hecho

**Landlocked Bolivia Awaits Decision**

The dispute between Chile and Peru also has direct implications for others
states around the region. In particular, Bolivia is closely watching legal
proceedings, and [has previously
stated](http://en.rian.ru/world/20111216/170295791.html)[en] that it plans to
make a case at the ICJ for Chile to provide coastal access to the Pacific that
was lost during the 1879-1881 between the two countries. The final outcome at
the ICJ case may add further impetus to Bolivia’s attempts to seek a
diplomatic solution to this longstanding issue.

Regardless of the ICJ resolution, the democratic and diplomatic statements
made by all parties have significantly reduced the risk of [armed
conflict](http://peruhistoriaygrandeza.blogspot.com/2012/12/confirmado-peru-
se-arma-ante-posible.html)between the parties.

This has, in turn provided the foundations for the development of more
creative solutions aimed at ending the crises. These include “A Maritime Zone
of Bilateral Participation” [proposed
by](http://malcolmallison.lamula.pe/2012/12/04/zona-maritima-de-participacion-
bilateral-solucion-a-la-controversia-peruchile/malcolmallison) Jilmar Moisés
Córdova: “A Maritime Zone of Bilateral Participation”. This argues:

> La controversia marítima de Perú y Chile, puede llegar a una posible
> solución instaurándose […] la Zona Marítima de Participación Bilateral la
> cual dividiría los mares de ambos Estados y que sería destinada a la pesca,
> […] es decir, la explotación de los recursos vivos por embarcaciones de
> hasta cierto tonelaje de los pueblos del Perú y Chile. Por ejemplo Argentina
> y Uruguay mantienen un tratado parecido a esta forma que delimita sus mares
> soberanos.

> The maritime dispute between Peru and Chile, can reach a possible solution
> by a so-called Maritime Zone Bilateral Involvement or Participation, which
> divide the seas of the two states and would be intended for fishing, […] the
> exploitation of resources by boats of a certain tonnage from both Peru and
> Chile. For instance, Argentina and Uruguay hold a treaty like this so that
> delimits their sovereign seas.

Córdova also considers that such an alternative could give both countries the
chance of exploring and benefiting from mineral, oil and other resources. He
is also confident that the Maritime Zone Bilateral Involvement could provide
alternative options for Bolivia’s coastal aspirations.
