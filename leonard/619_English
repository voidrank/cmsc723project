Mexico is currently living one of the worst natural disasters to hit the
country in years. Mexican [newspaper _Milenio [es]_
](http://www.milenio.com/node/523119)confirmed that in two states affected by
flooding, [Veracruz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz) and
[Tabasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabasco), more than 25 thousand people
had to evacuate their homes, as the “Temazcal” and “Cerro de Oro” dams could
soon overflow because of expected heavy rainfalls.

Twitter users have commented on the cruel situation their homeland is
experiencing, like Marisol Montúfar (@hereismarisol), [who wrote

Feeling conflicted, I love the rain but what is happening in #Tlacotalpan is a
pity

When [the earthquake] in Haiti happened, trucks and trucks full of help came,
and now that we need it there is nothing

According to the News Agency _[Prensa Latina [es]](http://www.prensa-
latina.cu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=217533&Itemid=1)_ , the
economic losses are worst than expected: “Mexican authorities report
millionaire losses caused by rain floods, 25 municipalities in the State of
Veracruz will need at least 131 million dollars in order to repair their
damaged infrastructure.”

Last week, to show solidarity and under the pressure of a spontaneous and
insistent crowd, President Felipe Calderón walked through [Tlacotalpan,
Veracruz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlacotalpan,_Veracruz), touring about
one kilometer across the water and the flooded streets. According to _[El
Universal [es]](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/705465.html)_ , in the
streets the water level reached between 1 to 1.5 meters.

On Twitter, Caderon's visit caused a discussion as well. Manuel (@mdgo80[)

They say that the water in #Veracruz does not go higher than 30 cms, they
measured it with #Calderon ‘s knees

Some users are skeptical, as they believe Calderón was posing for the press
rather than showing solidarity by walking through the flooded streets. Mario

Why did Felipe Calderon go to Veracruz? Answer = to take a picture

But Pachicle (@Pachicle) [has a different perspective

Calderon is straightening his course, [he caught “The
Barbie”](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38924291/ns/world_news-americas/) and he
goes into the flooded streets in Veracruz. He does not want to lose the
presidency
