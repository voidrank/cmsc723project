2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/).**_

Debates over the risks and benefits of nuclear power plants have sparked
worldwide, since an [8.9-magnitude
earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/11/largest-earthquake-in-
recorded-history-in-japan/) struck Japan on Friday, 11 March causing
widespread fear that the nuclear reactors of at least two power plants near
Fukushima may be at risk of melt down. Thousands of citizens in areas at risk
of radiation in the North East region are being evacuated in case the very
worst should happen. There was [an
explosion](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/12/japan-fear-in-fukushima/)
at one plant in Fukushima on Saturday, 12 March.

Throughout the day, Japanese citizens shared their concerns on Twitter. Some
urging against alarmist tweeting that could cause panic, and many more venting
frustrations over safety risks.

> 原発では被爆しながら作業してくれている人がいる。そのことに感謝し場違いな原発批判は控えましょう。

@himanainu_kawai: There are people working in the nuclear power plant that are
facing exposure to radiation. Let’s be thankful and refrain from nuclear power
criticism now.

Others have questioned the wisdom of developing nuclear energy in such an
earthquake-prone country as Japan:

> [@saltfish_nsk](http://twitter.com/saltfish_nsk/status/46502502065119232):
> 電力会社は、地震が原発にとって最悪の事態を引き起こす事は百も承知。そもそも日本は地震国。何故それが必要なのか、事故は原爆と同じ事。お上は過去から何を学んできたのか。

@saltfish_nsk: Electric companies know well enough that earthquakes could
cause the worst to happen to a nuclear power plant. First and foremost, Japan
is an earthquake country. Why do we need nuclear power? Any accident is the
same as the A-bomb. It makes one wonder what have the government has learned
from the past.

A [blogger](http://lovedeath7.blog60.fc2.com/) who describes himself as a
pacifist and former officer of Japanese self-defence forces (@BND7) leaves
little room for debate:

> [@BND7](http://twitter.com/BND7/status/46503655150587904): 日本に原発は必要です

@BND7: Japan needs nuclear power plants.

A [magazine](http://ameblo.jp/gocci-mode/) editor and spare time musician
says:

> [@gocci0515](http://twitter.com/gocci0515/status/46518658914189312):
> 普段使いたい放題電気使ってるクセに、こういう事態になると「原発原発」ってよく知りもせずに毛嫌いする。じゃあ他のエネルギー源を教えてくれ。自分たちの存在自体が必要悪だって言いながら、事故に遭ってる関係者の気持ちを考えろ！原子力に代わるものがあればいいのにと一番願ってるのは彼らだ。

@gocci0515: People use as much electricity as they like on any given day, and
then start spouting dislike for nuclear power when something like this
happens, even though most people just don’t understand it that well. Then give
us an alternative energy source! If you’re going to say that your existence is
a necessary evil, think about how the personnel onsite must feel. They are the
ones that most wish for an alternative to nuclear power.

**Who is to blame?**

Some critics have placed the blame for the catastrophic situation on the
energy demands of large cities such as capital Tokyo.

> [@mokko0307](http://twitter.com/mokko0307/status/46503581674778624):
> 福島とか新潟に原発があるのは東京とかの人のためなんだよね。無駄な電気使わなければ原発必要なかったし今こんなことにもならなかったのに・・・って思うと(´；ω；｀)
> ほんとに電気の無駄遣いとかまじめに考えるべきですね・・・

@mokko0307: The reason we have nuclear power plants in Fukushima and Niigata
Prefectures [regions] is for people in Tokyo and other big cities. If people
didn’t waste electricity, there wouldn't be a need for these facilities and
things like this wouldn’t have had to happen….. We should seriously tackle the
issue of electricity waste.

Anger has been directed by some at a perceived last of interest or concern in
the disaster and affected people, particularly in Tokyo. This tweet is from
Saturday:

> [@cobayasu](http://twitter.com/cobayasu/status/46516156290441216):
> こと渋谷に関して言えば、オーロラビジョンもいつも通り流れていたし、TSUTAYAも開
> いていた。パチンコ屋は土曜日ということもあって混んでいた。福島の原発や、被災者の方々の現実とは無関係のように、渋谷は日常を取り戻そうとしている。
> 街にTwitter上の一体感や危機感は見えない…

@cobayasu: In regards to Shibuya [area in central Tokyo], the big screen
display Aurora Vision is alight as usual, as are the shops. Pachinko parlours
[amusement gambling arcades] are open, and it’s crowded like on a usual
Saturday. Shibuya is working to regain its day-to-day life as if it has no
connection to the reality of Fukushima’s nuclear plant and afflicted people.
The feeling of unity and crisis on Twitter can't be felt throughout town.

Referring to how few companies had switched off their electric signs on the
night of 12 March, @MasaKawaKAKA tweeted:

@MasaKawaKAKA: Glico is the only one company that understands the situation!

**What to do?**

As new problems with the emergency cooling systems of nuclear power plants
[continue to surface](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/12/us-japan-
quake-nuclear-cooling-idUSTRE72B3GI20110312), there are many fearful tweets:

> [@WindyxLady](http://twitter.com/WindyxLady/status/46510958453067776):
> あの映像、原発やばいでしょ。風向きは被災地側。最悪の状況か？ 海外に原子力に精通する作業のエキスパートの支援が必要なのでは。
> 国民にも話せないほど深刻な問題なのだろうか？

@WindyxLady: That clip of the nuclear power plant is freaking scary! The wind
is blowing toward the stricken area. Could this be the worst situation? We
might need some expert advice from overseas that are familiar with the
workings of nuclear power. Is this something so serious that the government
can’t tell its people?

A web programmer in Fukuoka Prefecture takes a fatalist stance:

> [@sino1945](http://twitter.com/sino1945/status/46503021143789568):
> まぁ…遠くにいる私が福島原発の詳細を知る必要は、ない。知ったところで、ね。現場の健闘と無事を祈るのみ。

@sino1945: Well… as someone far away from Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, I
need not know the details. Can’t do anything even if I had information, right?
I can only pray for the safety and efforts of the staff on the ground.
