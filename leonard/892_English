In the wake of the [12 January
earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/haiti-
earthquake-2010/) that devastated southern Haiti, Global Voices assembled a
small team of editors and authors to provide [detailed
coverage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/haiti-
earthquake-2010/) of rescue, relief, and recovery efforts. One of our
challenges is the relatively small scale of Haitian citizen media. Very few
Haitians currently use online tools to publicly share news or opinions. In the
past two weeks, Global Voices has leaned heavily on the social media streams
of a handful of regular tweeters and bloggers with access to electricity and
Internet connections. We've supplemented this coverage with information from
the blogs and Twitter streams of foreign aid workers and NGOs on the ground.

We at Global Voices believe there is an urgent need to amplify Haitian
perspectives on relief and reconstruction efforts. One crucial way is to
increase citizen media activity locally in Haiti, thereby making available
more news and commentary that may positively affect awareness, interest,
conversations, and decisions in the coming months.

To this end, Global Voices has sent a two-person team to Port-au-Prince, to
help support citizen media coverage. GV's managing director [Georgia
Popplewell](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/georgia-popplewell/) and
former Francophonia editor [Alice
Backer](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/alice-backer/) have spent the
past six days assessing the situation on the ground, making contact with
Haitians using citizen media tools, and identifying others with the potential
to participate in and enrich the online conversation, given the right
resources.

Both have been issuing regular reports via their personal blogs and Twitter
accounts: Georgia at [_Caribbean Free
Radio_](http://www.caribbeanfreeradio.com/blog/) and
[_@georgiap_](http://twitter.com/georgiap), Alice at
[_Kiskeácity_](http://www.kiskeyacity.blogspot.com/) and
[_@kiskeacity_](http://twitter.com/kiskeacity). Georgia is also posting photos
at [her Flickr
account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/georgiap/sets/72157623158282173/). And
we will be using their firsthand reporting to complement Global Voices’
coverage of the ongoing online conversation.

Writing at her blog [a few days before leaving for
Haiti](http://www.caribbeanfreeradio.com/blog/2010/01/20/haiti-bound/),
Georgia explained:

> I suspect that given the magnitude of the damage—and the magnitude of US
> involvement in the relief and reconstruction efforts—the Haiti earthquake
> isn’t going to disappear from the pages of the major media in the way that
> other stories have. But it’s going to be a different kind of coverage, and
> one that won’t necessarily highlight local stories.
>
> Another of our key goals, therefore, is to highlight the need for local
> voices in the mix and increase the opportunities for communities affected by
> the earthquake to be heard and understood by those working and reporting on
> the recovery—a group that includes Haitian institutions and media as well as
> international agencies. We don’t expect it will be easy: Haiti is a complex
> place and the damage to the country has been severe.
