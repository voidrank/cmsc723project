With three unresolved conflicts and a local media that often self-censors,
blogs comment on an [online project hoping to break
stereotypes](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/30/overcoming-negative-
stereotypes-in-the-south-caucasus/) by reporting on examples of ethnic groups
otherwise in conflict in the South Caucasus co-existing peacefully together.
The project was undertaken by _Global Voices Online's_ Caucasus editor
alongside bloggers and journalists from Azerbaijan and Georgia.

Since then, and a [series of posts](http://cau.blogs.tol.org/) for
_Transitions Online's Steady State_ , a number of other bloggers have
commented on the initiative. In an extended post, _Ianyan_ , a blog-based
Armenian online magazine, says that the outcome of the project is [reason for
hope in a region fractured by ethnic divides and historical
differences](http://www.ianyanmag.com/?p=1835).

> In Tsopi, a Georgian village close to the Armenian border, a group of 80
> pupils study together at a dilapidated school with no running water or
> electricity. Although this scenario might not seem uncommon in parts of the
> world, the students, who are ethnic Azeri and Armenians might surprise you.
> Armenians know the Azerbaijani language and Azeris know Armenian. After
> countless years of war and animosity, co-existence seems like a Utopian
> fantasy for these two groups.
>
> […]

> The fact that there is still some corner in the world where two ethnic
> groups with loaded histories can interact and live together in peace leaves
> room for hope, a notion that is evident by the comments left on posts as
> Transitions Online.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijani regional analyst and blogger Arzu Geybullayeva also
[comments on its latest
phase](http://flyingcarpetsandbrokenpipelines.blogspot.com/2010/01/building-
dialogue-in-caucasus-road-to.html).

> This could be a real push in building dialog between the two countries and
> their people not to mention perhaps a beginning of strong ties. These trips
> show that coexistence is possible and its only a matter of effort and will
> to make such collaboration and coexistence happen. Maybe it is time stop
> using NK conflict as a bargaining chip and stall growing enmity between the
> two people, replacing it with more initiatives as such.

New media trainer, veteran journalist, and former online editor and consultant
for the _BBC_ , _CNN_ and _Al Jazeera_ , David Brewer, says the project is an
example of [the role](http://www.mediahelpingmedia.org/content/view/534/1/)
that online alternative voices could [play in the
region](http://www.mediahelpingmedia.org/content/view/551/198/).

> An online project, bringing together new and social media, is aiming to
> enhance understanding between the ethnic groups across the South Caucasus.
>
> […]
>
> Some in mainstream media welcome the perspectives offered by such
> initiatives. Richard Sambrook, the Director BBC Global News, says bloggers
> play a valuable role.

> “Social media provides increasingly important opportunities for an
> independent perspective on society or politics. Citizens can determine for
> themselves how their lives are seen and portrayed – independently of any
> political or commercial agenda.”

Over the coming days and weeks there will be more such examples using new
media and social networking tools and stories, photos, and video as a
continuation of the brief [cross-border
exercise](http://oneworld.am/diversity/) undertaken in September. Follow it on
