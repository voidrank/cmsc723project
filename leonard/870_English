On February 5, 2010, [two suicidal blasts struck the metropolitan city of
Karachi](http://bit.ly/cs57Ns) killing 15 people and leaving 70 wounded. The
first attack mainly targeted the Shia mourners traveling to join the Muharram
processions. The second blast took place outside the emergency department of
Jinnah Hospital, where the injured were being shifted. The attacks came 40
days after the [Ashura bombing](http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-
world/suicide-bomber-kills-20-at-pakistan-ashura-parade-20091229-lhhg.html)
that killed over 40 people. Unfortunately, Karachi has had a history of
violences of both ethnic and sectarian nature.

On my own blog I [recalled and
condemned](http://sanasaleem.com/2009/12/30/terror-strikes-home-again/) the
return of violence in Karachi:

> The aftermath of Monday’s suicide bombing – the widespread rioting and
> burning – are characteristic of the kind of reaction and vandalism that
> follow sectarian attacks. Soon after the blast, riots broke out in various
> parts of the city. It appears that there was absolutely no damage control by
> security forces at that point. As a result, hundreds of shops were set
> ablaze, and at some point on late Monday night, it seemed as if the entire
> business district was at risk. Attacks of such nature have almost always
> been accompanied by widespread tensions. As riots continue, more questions
> are being raised on the role of the security personnel and their absence as
> widespread vandalism continues. It is evident that the attack doesn’t only
> target a specific sect. It is an attack to terrorise the people of Karachi
> and embroil them in conflict, thereby damaging the country’s economic hub.

_Kalsoom Lakhani_ at [CHUP – Changing Up
Pakistan](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/stay-safe-
karachi/) condemned the series of attacks on Shia Muslims, and questioned the
law and order situation in the country:

> We may not be entirely certain who was responsible for today’s attacks, but
> it is nevertheless horrific that they could happen at all. If all three
> cities were placed on red alert yesterday, was there not more that could be
> done to prevent today’s death? The targeting of Shia pilgrims as well as a
> _hospital_ is not only tragic, but frankly also sickening. Is nowhere in
> Pakistan safe or untouched anymore?

In one comprehensive [post
](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/violence-in-karachi-101/)
earlier on the blog, _Kalsoom_ gave an insight on the history of violence in
Karachi. According to [Dawn](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/11-violence-explodes-across-north-
karachi--10) over 34 people lost their lives in ethnic violence in various
part of the city in April last year. The public at large is appalled by the
widespread violence and the authorities inability to establish control.

Another blogger _Farheen Ali_ , shares her concern over the worsening
situation of the city and inaction by the authorities in a post titled
[‘Unabated wave of target-killing at
Karachi’](http://farheenali.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/unabated-wave-of-target-
killing-at-karachi/).

> Following the violence, government has imposed section 144 across the Orangi
> Town. And after imposing the sections Government feels liberated from all
> the accountability and blame.

_Adil Najam_ at [All Things
Pakistan](http://pakistaniat.com/2010/01/14/weapon-liscences-prohibited/)
demands that Karachi should be made a weapon free zone:

> Even as violence of all forms spirals all over the country and even as, in
> the wake of the recent violence in there, politicians from all parties call
> for Karachi to be declared a “weapons free” zone (rightly!), it turns out
> that politicians and parliamentarians from all parties are busy distributing
> licenses for all forms of prohibited weapons as if these were kids candy.

Considering the recent unrest in Karachi, the government needs to take
immediate action in order to put an end to the violence. However, as the
[news](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/03-mqm-walks-out-of-sindh-assembly-after-
heated-debate-ss-03) suggests the authorities are busy settling internal
conflicts rather than addressing vital issues.
