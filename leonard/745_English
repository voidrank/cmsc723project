On 9 April, 2010, Prime Minister [Patrick
Manning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Manning) surprised many citizens
of Trinidad and Tobago by requesting the [dissolution of
Parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_parliament) and
triggering a snap [general
election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_general_election,_2010),
barely halfway through his government's current term in office. (Under the
country's [Westminster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system)-based
constitutional system, each Parliament has a maximum term of five years, but
the prime minister may call elections at any time.)

Manning's party, the [People's National
Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_National_Movement) (PNM),
won a comfortable majority in the [previous general election in
2007](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2007/11/06/trinidad-and-tobago-election-
results/), after the opposition vote was split between the [United National
Congress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_National_Congress) (UNC) and the
[Congress of the People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_People)
(COP). But in the past two years, the Manning administration faced growing
public anger about its spending on mega-construction projects, alleged
corruption by senior state officials, a rising crime rate, the government's
apparent deafness to public opinion, and the prime minister's own reputation
for arrogance.

With pressure from the media, the Opposition, and the general public mounting
earlier this year, Manning's announcement of the early election was seen by
some as an attempt to win a fresh mandate for the PNM government, and by
others as a play to head off a [motion of no
confidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence) in
Parliament. Manning may have been counting on another split in opposition
votes. But the main opposition party, the UNC, under its newly elected
political leader [Kamla Persad-
Bissessar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamla_Persad-Bissessar), instead
negotiated with the COP and other parties to form the [People's
Partnership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Partnership) coalition.
On election day, 24 May, when the votes were counted, the People's Partnership
won a total of 29 seats in the 41-member House of Representatives, with the
PNM reduced to 12 seats. Trinidad and Tobago found itself with a new
government.

During the campaign and on election night, as vote tallies were announced,
some of the most outspoken commentary on the two political parties appeared
semi-publicly on Facebook, with bloggers and tweeters also sharing their
opinions. For some, the big story was the election of the country's first
female prime minister. [“Woman is boss in Trinidad &
Tobago”](http://islandista.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/breaking-news-kamla-
persad-bissessar-first-female-pm-of-trinidad-tobago/) wrote _Islandista_ ,
quoting a popular 1988 calypso. _Mauvais Langue_ [posted a
link](http://1mauvaislangue.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/we-ask-for-change-and-we-
got-change/) to Persad-Bissessar's victory speech, commenting: “We ask for
Change and we got Change!”

Others were more cautious, looking ahead to the challenges facing the new
government and the nation, or trying to analyse the new political landscape.
On Twitter, Kevon Foderingham ([@kevon82](http://twitter.com/kevon82/))
wondered, [“Is it just me or did Manning want to lose the election? Something
is fishy with the PNM.”](http://twitter.com/kevon82/status/14665611176) __

__Blogger _Jumbie's Watch_ [expressed major
reservations](http://www.jumbieswatch.com/2010/05/when-yuh-win-yuh-lorse.html)
about two People's Partnership MPs rumoured to be in line for Cabinet posts.
_Now Is Wow Too_ , on the other hand, [offered this
advice](http://nowiswowtoo.blogspot.com/2010/05/congratulations.html):

> Let us all be patient and understanding as the new order takes over. There's

_Guanaguanare_ [urged](http://guanaguanaresingsat.blogspot.com/2010/05/things-
that-nation-needs.html) continued civic involvement:

> Our work has not ended. Be vigilant, be vocal, participate.

_gspottt_ , the blog of the sexual orientation rights group CAISO, [expressed
similar sentiments](http://gspottt.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/get-ready/),
asking readers to “Get ready to work with your new Government and Parliament
to move our issues forward.” And Twitter user Anthony
([@anthonycbis](http://twitter.com/anthonycbis)) remarked: [“I hope that the
press will continue to do its job and remain critical of the sitting
government at all times.”](http://twitter.com/anthonycbis/status/14669901812)

Many online commentators reacted to the defeat of Manning and the PNM with
humour and sarcasm. “I suppose Manning and accomplices must be wondering what
to do with all the victory food and drinks they ordered for the victory
party,” [wrote](http://akalol.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/trinidad-and-tobago-
elections-2010-a-review/) _This Beach Called Life_. On Twitter, David Wears
([@De_real_dwears](http://twitter.com/De_real_dwears)) announced:

> [30 ppl waiting outside PM @meetmanning residence, waiting to ‘assist’ him
> in MOVING OUT!!!](http://twitter.com/De_real_dwears/status/14693713409)

And _Fake Patrick Manning_
([@patrickmanning](http://twitter.com/patrickmanning)), who remained
relatively quiet during the campaign, issued a stream of satirical comments:

> [Setting up a wiki to crowdsource the text of my concession speech. Link
> coming soon!](http://twitter.com/patrickmanning/status/14663303994)

> [Realised I don't know how to set up wiki to crowdsource concession speech.

Jamaica](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/24/jamaica-state-of-
