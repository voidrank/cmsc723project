Protests in Yemen against [President Ali Abdullah
Saleh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh) entered into an eighth
day on Saturday with more demonstrations throughout much of the country.
Clashes between protesters and the military [seem to be
worsening](http://twitter.com/#!/Dima_Khatib/status/38965343200346112) by the
day since the demonstrations began on February 11.

At least [six protesters have
died](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/02/18/yemen-end-deadly-attacks-
protesters) in Yemen since February 16, and [one more protester was reportedly
killed](http://www1.albawaba.com/main-headlines/protester-killed-yemeni-
capital) on Saturday, on the outskirts of
[Sanaa](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sana%27a), Yemen's
capital, according to AFP. Al Jazeera
[reported](http://english.aljazeera.net//news/middleeast/2011/02/2011219142955892386.html)
that a group of roughly 1,000 anti-regime protesters clashed with a group of
300-400 pro-Saleh protesters. Some people said they heard gunshots amidst the
crowds. The Yemen Post
[reported](http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&SubID=3160&MainCat=3)
that four people were arrested in Saana.

Saleh has been in power for more than three decades, and protesters complain
his regime is corrupt and incited to violence. As protesters in Egypt clamored
for Honsi Mubarek to step down earlier this month, Saleh hoped to head-off
domestic criticism by [promising](http://www.independent.ie/world-news/middle-
east/yemens-32year-president-abandons-plans-for-dynasty-2523158.html) not to
seek re-election when his term ends in 2013. Saleh
[claims](http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&SubID=3157&MainCat=3)
foreign sources have influenced opposition protesters, who may destabilize the
country.

Here is a video of street protests and gunshots near Saana University.

an overview of Saturday's events:

> The day started off bad in Sanaa when students managed to beat [ruling party
> General People's Congress]-paid thugs* to the area outside of Sanaa
> University. ([Michelle Shephard details the
> day](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/941890--student-shot-on-day-
> nine-of-yemen-protests) in an excellent report for the Toronto star.) After
> that things got worse. In addition to the usual stick-wielding thugs, some
> of the men, reported to be tribesmen, opened fire on the students, wounding
> several…
>
> But the escalation is a worrying sign, even more so in the light of the fact
> that many reporters on the ground (local Yemeni reporters) said that they
> recognized security officials among the plain clothes GPC-thugs. There were
> also unconfirmed reports that the government has trucked in tribesmen from
> outside Sanaa to attempt to put down the students’ protests.
>
> Things were relatively peaceful today in Taizz after yesterday's grenade
> attack…
>
> Aden was more violent, although some of this was tempered today by security
> forces moving out of certain areas. Last night protesters in Aden burned a
> police station and several government vehicles.

Here are a few Tweets from later in the day:
