Fiji Water may not leave Fiji after all.

Less than 24 hours after closing its bottling plant because of a new
government tax it called “discriminatory,” Fiji Water decided to
[reopen](http://www.fijiwater.com/blog/2010/11/30/fiji-water-reopen-plant/)
for business in Western Viti Levu. In perhaps a conciliatory gesture,
representatives of the US-based premium water company also met with Fiji’s
Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum and leader Frank Bainimarama, who came to
power in a 2006 coup.

The decision was [hailed](http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=161047) by
Bainimarama, not least because Fiji Water’s 400 employees will keep their jobs
but the additional tax revenue could [add
another](http://www.fijivillage.com/?mod=story&id=01121073a94f65aa2ed49bfb00750b)
$11.7 million US to government coffers. Fiji Water said it would comply with
the country’s Water Resources Tax that charges $15 cents (8 US cents) per
liter if it extracts more than 3.5 million liters per month. The company
presently pays .18 US cents per liter of water it extracts. Fiji Water
complained the tax was unfair because it set the 3.5 million liter threshold
because no other bottler on the islands extracts that much. The bottlers
falling under the threshold will continue to pay .11 cents (.06 US cents) per
liter.

 **About face?** This reversal caps a very public fight between the country’s
largest exporter and Fiji’s government, which began November 18 when the
government deported Fiji Water's local representative for allegedly
interfering in the country’s internal affairs. One week later, the government
announced the new tax on water bottlers during its 2011 budget statement. A
few days later, the company said it was shutting the doors to its bottling
plant, canceling all contracts and halting several development projects.

Bainimarama then [hit back](http://crosbiew.blogspot.com/2010/11/tale-of-two-
statements-fiji-water-and.html#more) with stinging criticism claiming the
company makes millions in the US and other countries, but pays less than
$530,000 US in corporate taxes per year. He also claimed Fiji Water under-
prices its exports from Fiji by selling the water to a sister-company based in
the US.

The company did not respond, but has long
[stated](http://www.fijiwater.com/blog/2010/11/29/discriminatory-tax-forces-
shutdown-of-fiji-water-factory/) it is a good corporate neighbor, contributing
$70 US million in export revenue to Fiji and provides the country with
millions of dollars in development and education projects, along with
supporting an estimated 4,000 people.

**On to leases**  
Now Fiji Water’s tax status has been cleared up, Bainimarama
[said](http://www.radiofiji.com.fj/fullstory.php?id=32631) the government will
begin reviewing lease payments of multinational companies making large profits
using Fiji land. He used Fiji Water as an example, claiming the company pays
$11,000 (about $5,500 US) to lease the land for its bottling plant, up from
$5,000 in 1995. The country is home to a number of international resorts, all
of whom make deals with local landowners for renting the land their buildings
sit on. In most cases, non-indigenous Fijians cannot own land, unless in
designated areas, which make up less than 10 percent of the country’s
territory.

This revenue will come in handy in an economy the International Monetary Fund
recently [said]( http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2010/pr10430.htm)
contracted three percent in 2009 and will move up to zero-percent growth this
year with one-percent growth estimated for 2011. On top of that, Fiji
[must](http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=21031/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-
full.tpl?PHPSESSID=df05b1cc2c6446acae96a4f01a077386) repay $300 US loan to the
IMF in September 2011.

**Square-bottle blues**  
In the blogs, there was not much sympathy for the US-based bottled water
company.

**Kiwi Water?**  
Talk in Fiji has shifted to ways Fiji Water could get around paying the taxes.
One rumor is Stewart and Lynda Resnick, the millionaire American couple who
own Fiji Water,
[purchased](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10691120)
in 2008 Spring Fresh brand of bottled water, based outside of Christchurch,
New Zealand.  
The purchase of the company in 2008, months after the Fiji’s government first
proposed a levy on water bottlers, has not gone unnoticed by some
[bloggers](http://fijitoday.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/fiji-water-to-bottle-
fiji-brand-water-in-new-zealand/) and forum posters.
