Reports of [protests](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12295864) in
Yemen are being received with delight across the Arab world, where netizens
are showing a lot of support for their Yemeni brothers and sisters.

According to the BBC, thousands of Yemenis are demonstrating in the capital
Sanaa, calling on president Ali Abdulla Saleh, who has been in power for more
than 30 years, to step down. The timing of the Yemeni protests coincides with
[widespread
demonstrations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-
protests-2011/) across Egypt, calling for an end of Hosni Mubarak's 30-year
rule, and follow the [Tunisian people's
uprising,](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/) which saw strongman Zein Al Abidine Ben Ali and his family
flee Tunisia, after ruling it with an iron first for 23 years.

On Twitter, the mood was jubilant, as netizens from around the world wished
Yemen would go the Tunisian way, and oust Saleh.
