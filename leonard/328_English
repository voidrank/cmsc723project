Symbol of the World Day Against Cyber Censorship, Reporters Without Borders

Yesterday, 12 March was the World Day Against Cyber-Censorship. Launched by
[_Reporters Without Borders_](http://en.rsf.org/  "Reporters Without Borders")
in 2008, the initiative is intended to promote the idea of Internet without
restrictions and accessible to everyone.

Recently _Reporters Without Borders_ have published a list of countries, that
are considered to be [The Enemies of the
Internet](http://march12.rsf.org/en/#ccenemies "The Enemies of the Internet
"). The list includes 10 countries: Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The Internet
censorship and persecution of bloggers is usual in these countries. There is
also a [list ](http://march12.rsf.org/en/#ccenemies "list")of Countries (16)
Under Surveillance where freedom of expression online is under risk and there
are some attempts of the governments to control the Internet.

Thus, the World Day Against Cyber-Censorship initiative is an attempt to
attract attention of civil society to limitation of the freedom of speech in
online media.

RSF [reports](http://march12.rsf.org/en/ "reports"):

> The year 2010 firmly established the role of social networks and the
> Internet as mobilisation and news transmission tools, especially during the
> Arab spring. New and traditional media have proven to be increasingly
> complementary. Meanwhile, repressive regimes have intensified censorship,
> propaganda and repression, keeping 119 netizens in jail. Issues such as
> national security – linked to the WikiLeaks publications – and intellectual
> property – are challenging democratic countries’ support to online free
> speech.

For instance, in Uzbekistan – one of the countries mentioned by RSF as an
Enemy of the Internet, all opposition websites and sites that report on real
conditions in the country are banned. Among them are not only websites of
local and Russian news agencies, such as _ferghana.ru,_ _Neweurasia.net,
Uzmetronom.com, Eurasianet.org,_ but also international ones like _BBC.com_
and _Aljazeera.net._

This is what Uzbekistan-based users see when trying to access _neweurasia.net_
’s URL directly:

On March 11, 2011 RSF published an [article ](http://en.rsf.org/ouzbekistan-
uzbekistan-11-03-2011,39765.html "article")on Internet access and online
journalism in Uzbekistan. The RSF researchers came to the
[conclusion](http://en.rsf.org/ouzbekistan-uzbekistan-11-03-2011,39765.html
"conclusion"):

> As long as Uzbek authorities continue to demonstrate a growing interest in

> prospects look dark for freedom of expression in Uzbekistan’s cyberspace

Cyber censorship in Uzbekistan includes not only news outlets but also social
networks, blogging platforms, mail services, etc. For this reason many Uzbek
users find tools (proxy-servers) that enable them to securely circumvent this
censorship. Many understand that the simplest way to circumvent cyber-
censorship is to use a browser proxy. Many are free of charge and allow access
to most of the blocked Internet resources through a browser.

The most popular and user-friendly browser proxies are _[Your
Freedom](http://your-freedom.net/)_ , _[Tor](http://www.torproject.org/)_ ,
[HotSpotShield](http://hotspotshield.com/), [Psiphon](https://granizza.info/).

More detailed information about circumvention tools, including those mentioned
in this message, can be found at [sesawe.net](http://sesawe.net/) .

Video lessons on the configuration and use of proxy-servers with subtitles in
different languages are available
