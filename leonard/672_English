More than 70 Iranian university graduates and academics are
[calling](http://freehamedsaber.blogspot.com/2010/07/blog-post.html) [fa] for
the release of Hamed Saber, an Iranian photo-blogger and computer scientist
who was arrested for unknown reasons on 21 June 2010 in Tehran. A friend has
informed us that it was the first time Hamed was arrested. The same source
said several of [Hamed's photos
](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hamed/sets/72157619809375336/) of the Iranian
protest movement have been published in foreign magazines without his
knowledge.

Hamed is also the developer of “[Access Flickr](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-
US/firefox/addon/4286/)“, a Firefox internet browser extension that bypasses
filters on the photo-sharing website Flickr in Iran, United Arab Emirates,
Saudi Arabia, China and other locations where it is banned. One of Hamed's
friends [posted
](http://www.flickr.com/groups/iranian/discuss/72157624500332314)a letter in a
discussion forum on Flickr seeking support for Hamed:

> As some of you might already know, it has been nearly a month since Hamed
> Saber our dear friend and artist and the founder of Iranian group on Flickr
> has been arrested for no apparent reason.
>
> There has been no news of him except for two telephone calls from an
> anonymous place.
>
> A group of his old friends, university class mates and professors from well-
> known universities around the world have issued a letter requesting Hamed’s
> release.
>
> All of us know him for quite a long time, since our first days of membership
> in this group or maybe in trips we went together with him.  
>  Many of us started photography in Flickr and specifically this group and

>
> Today he is imprisoned for no clear reason and this is an opportunity to

> I thought we could write a letter or statement and defend his position as an

> I am not that good at writing, any comment or idea or any suggestions for a

The statement calls on Iranian leaders to give Saber a fair trial.
