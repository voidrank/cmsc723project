After being adrift at sea for more than 30 hours, 40 Rohingya refugees were
rescued by a Vietnamese ship, MV Nosco Victory, on December 5, 2012. A few
days after, the ship reached Singapore but the government refused entry to the
Rohingya survivors. Singapore netizens and human rights groups reacted
strongly to the decision of authorities to send away the refugees.

the right decision was to give temporary shelter to the Rohingya:

Where Bears Roam Free accuses the government of being
[‘heartless’](http://wherebearsroamfree.blogspot.sg/2012/12/rohingya-refugees-
and-shameless.html):

Limpeh debunks the [government
arguments](http://limpehft.blogspot.sg/2012/12/singapores-benevolent-egg.html)
for rejecting the Rohingya:

> …when you are fleeing genocide or war, you just run and go wherever you can

> shelter whilst waiting for transit to a third country willing to take
> refugees, that means simply offering them shelter for a few weeks or months
> – is that too much to ask?

There is a long and heated [exchange of
opinion](https://www.facebook.com/theonlinecitizen/posts/478963365475923) on

Desparatebeep is [disappointed](http://desparatebeep.blogspot.sg/2012/12/who-
gives-shit-theyre-just-human.html) with the politicians who sent away the
refugees:

A Singapore twitter user is also saddened by the decision of the government:

Rohingya is an ethnic group which is struggling for recognition in Myanmar.
But the government of Myanmar continues to refuse to grant citizenship rights
to [Rohingya
residents](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/rohingya-myanmar-
burma/). Local conflicts erupted this year involving Rakhine and Rohingya
villagers in Western Myanmar. The government has denied that the Rohingyas are
victims of genocide and religious persecution.

Fortunately, Malaysia
[agreed](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/12/20/nation/12483254&sec=nation)
to give shelter to the 40 Rohingya refugees.
