The [5th International conference on Gross National Happiness
(GNH)](http://www.felicidadeinternabruta.org.br/en.html)
[ended](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=14068)
on 24th November, 2009. It was held in Iguacu, Brazil and was attended by
about a thousand participants from several countries of the world represented
by all cross sections of societies.

According to the [Center for Bhutan
Studies](http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/main/gnhfive.php), the aim of the
fifth GNH conference was to bring together policy makers, civil society,
intellectuals and academics and explore issues pertaining to development.

Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the 4th King of Bhutan first coined the concept of
Gross National Happiness [(GNH) __](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNH)when he
was barely in his 20’s. As King of a small and poor country, he sought the
unconventional path to development by focusing on the quality and happiness of
his people rather than GDP/GNP as the ultimate goal.

The first conference was held in [Bhutan in
2004](http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/ArticlesonGNH/gnh1.aspx), the
second one in [Nova Scotia, Canada in
2005](http://www.gpiatlantic.org/conference/), the third in [Thailand in
2007](http://www.gnh-movement.org/), and the [fourth was in Bhutan in
2008](http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/).

The [4 pillars of
GNH](http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/gnhIndex/intruductionGNH.aspx)
include socio-economic development, preservation of cultural values,
conservation of the natural environment and establishment of good governance.
And these include many indicators like psychological well being, health,
education, living standards etc.

The premise of such a philosophy is more or less embedded in E. F Schumacher’s
1973 revolutionary book, “[Small is Beautiful; Economics as if People
Mattered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful),” and something he
called “Buddhist Economics.”

But as the world tries to grasp onto the idea of whether GNH can work or
whether it is just a fuzzy notion, Bhutan – the country where the concept
first originated – has been asking whether GNH has run ahead of itself.

The debate started when the Bhutanese Prime Minister returned from the
conference last week and [said
that](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=14096)
GNH has spread so fast that it is being taken more seriously in places other
than Bhutan, its country of origin, and that the country is falling behind.

The leader of the opposition in Bhutanese parliament, _Tshering Tobgay_ ,
avidly retorted on [his
blog](http://www.tsheringtobgay.com/government/2009/bringing-gnh-home.html):

> “Very good. Our government now understands what the common man has long
> known: namely that, to increase happiness levels, we need is less talk and
> more action.”

_Invisible_ , a reader, commented on his post:

> “I strongly disagree with our Lyonchhen and say that, “Bhutan is not lagging
> behind in GNH.” Bhutanese Society is GNH Society. GNH is in our “values” and
> in our “thinking.”

And _Tangba_ , another reader, commented:

> “The fact is GNH was there since long time back and all the civilized
> nations had been implementing it for centuries. The only difference is that
> they didn’t call it GNH as we do. They called it by other collective names:
> quality education, good health care, clean environment, nature and wildlife
> conservation, preservation of culture and traditions, strong economy,
> freedom of speech, corruption free administration, human rights and so on.
> Then why are we making a big fuss about it?”

Meanwhile _Rubiks_ at _Kuzu-Bhutan Weblog_ [begged to
differ](http://www.kuzuzangpo.com/index.php?misc=search&subaction=showfull&id=1232497793&archive=1250305228&cnshow=news&ucat=&start_from):

> Some people may ask, “why all this fuss against GNH now?” Well! I say this –
> it has become incredibly difficult to have a meaningful debate about
> anything without someone dragging the term “GNH” into it…I am tired of this
> cliché.
>
> …I know I am living in a real world and not some fairy tale world. In order
> to measure happiness, we need to have a very clear understanding about
> happiness. Happiness is a state of mind, which is not constant. Philosophers
> have been trying to define “mind” for centuries, yet they are still left
> with the same fundamental question – what is mind? Happiness is a subjective
> entity hence to measure it objectively is just a fallacy.

_Awakened fellow_ , a commenter on the above post, countered:

> “Nobody says that Bhutan has achieved GNH. We all accept that there is much
> to strive for even to reach near GNH. But that doesn't mean that GNH is
> crap.
>
> GNH is a broad idea. It is a guide and inspiration – not a rule, solution or
> a prescription. Yes, we have many problems and we are far from GNH. But,
> even just having GNH as our guide, and striving for it is a big thing.”

But _Unagi_
[agreed](http://www.kuzuzangpo.com/index.php?misc=search&subaction=showfull&id=1234760153&archive=1250305228&cnshow=news&ucat=&start_from=&)
in another post on _Kuzu-Bhutan Weblog_ :

> “GNH does not mean having a Land Cruiser and living in a comfortable Duplex
> and getting a degree from the U.S. BUT what is GNH is the fact that every
> one is happy because they have the basic NEEDS.
>
> GNH is a mutual benefit philosophy and you should share the unhappiness of
> those fellow citizens who are apparently NOT happy because their children
> are walking for hours to get to school, because they don't have enough food
> to survive and they definitely cannot worry about a Land Cruiser, believe
> me.  
>  GNH is beautiful, I accept that but what I'm saying is…for GNH money is
> essential and for GNH to be ACHIEVED, resources need to be SHARED equally
> among everyone. Not some owning Land Cruisers and other not even being able
> to afford taxis. That is when MONEY comes into play for happiness.”

Some bloggers like _Sonam Tshering_ [argued](http://sonamtshering-
sonam.blogspot.com/2009/11/concept-of-gnh-is-growing-more-complex.html) that
giving GNH a formal platform had, instead, made it worse for the commoner:

> “In 2004, the Centre for Bhutan Studies for the first time organized an
> international conference on Operationalizing of Gross National Happiness.
> Subsequently, the centre organized similar international conferences in
> Canada, Thailand and this year is Brazil. Since then, the concept of GNH has
> grown beyond the comprehension of the common people.
>
> Now the question that remains is how it can be applied in the ground
> realities of the common people. The concept has grown too high, most common
> people today feel that GNH is only for the experts and high level
> officials.”

The Bhutanese Prime Minister [put the onus on the
individuals](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122722856525546347.html) to make
it happen:

> “It [a government] must try to create the right conditions, but the
> individual himself and herself must pursue happiness.”

As the debate rages on, it seems – at least – that they inadvertently agreed
one thing: that Bhutan needed to work on GNH at home, rather than letting
international academics seek definition and run away with the idea. So far,
however, Bhutan has been pretty successful in selling it. This summer the
President of France Nicolas Sarkozy also wanted to measure his country’s
economic progress through GNH (the proposal was [later
rejected](http://www.bhutannewsservice.com/main-news/france-rejects-gnh/)).
Now the challenge remains to bring the concept home to roost.
