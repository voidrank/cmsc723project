Bangladesh's 3,492 kilometers of national highways and 4,268 kilometers of
regional highways have become a death trap for many travelers for a variety of
reasons. Statistics [show that](http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-
details.php?nid=198551) every year nearly 4,000 people die in around 20,000
road crashes across the country.

The nation was shocked to learn about the death of two of its favourite sons,
award-winning film director [Tareque
Masud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tareque_Masud) and internationally
renowned cameraman/television journalist [Ashfaque Munier
Mishuk](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=724).
They died in a tragic road accident on 13 August, 2011, while returning to
capital Dhaka from Manikganj on the Dhaka-Aricha highway when an oncoming
passenger bus collided head-on with their minibus and tore it apart killing
five instantly, and injuring several people. Tareque's United States-born wife
Catherine Masud was also injured seriously in the accident.

Netizens have been mourning the death of the two ever since. _Sahidul Alam_
[breaks the news](http://www.shahidulnews.com/2011/08/drik-mourns/) [The post
contains some pictures of the wreckage and people mourning]:

Tareque Masud's first full-length feature film [Matir
Moina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matir_Moina) (The Clay Bird) won the
International Critic's Award at the Cannes film Festival in 2002. It was one
of the first Bangladeshi films to widely circulated around the world.

Ashfaque (Mishuk) Munier, the CEO of [ATN
News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATN_News), stated his career as a teacher
of Journalism at Dhaka University and previously worked for international
media such as BBC World, Discovery Channel, National Geographic and [the Real
News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_News). He was also an eminent
cinematographer and worked in many of Tareque Masud's films.

[portrays](http://dhakadweller.blogspot.com/2011/08/highway-to-death.html) the
sorry state of Bangladeshi highways:

> Of the things that bother me about Bangladesh, lack of safety on roads is
> near the top of the list. Poor road conditions, old vehicles, inept drivers
> and reckless driving make our roads deathtraps – both city roads and
> highways. Not a day goes by that we don't hear of a road accident claiming
> multiple lives. And it gets worse in the monsoon season, when heavy rains
> aggravate the problem.

She goes on:

> Our political leaders dutifully express shock at the accidents, pray for the
> salvation of the departed souls and express sympathy for the bereaved
> families. Empty promises are made to punish the guilty (bus and truck
> drivers somehow always manage to escape and evade the law enforcement
> agencies). Enquiry committees are sometimes formed to investigate the
> accident. The public never hears the committee reports, and I doubt the
> government pays any heed to their recommendations – if indeed, any are made.

_Asif Anwar_ [thinks](http://ideas-4-brighter-
bangladesh.blogspot.com/2011/08/why-most-accidents-happen-in.html) that
roadside trees blocking the visibility of the vehicles in curvy roads may be a
cause of the increasing number of accidents in Bangladesh.

However, a recent article in the Daily Star [reveals
that](http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=198551)
breaking rules is the rule of the highways. And the perpetrators do not stop
because of the clemency – a driver can only be punished up to 5 years in jail
for killing someone on the road.

_Faruk Wasif_ [shows his anger](http://unmochon.com/node/719) [bn] over the
lack of road safety in the country and the negligence of the authorities:

> সড়কগুলো অপঘাতের জন্য সদাপ্রস্তুত। যানবাহন দুর্ঘটনামুখী, চালকেরা কেয়ারলেস।
> দেখার কেউ নাই, ব্যবস্থা নাই, শাস্তি নাই। [..] মানুষ মরছে, কিন্তু কোনো
> জবাবদিহি নাই। জাতি নামক গাভী দোহনে ব্যস্ত শাসকেরা। কিছুতেই তাদের কিছু এসে
> যায় না।

The highways are inviting accidents. The vehicles are accident-prone, the
drivers are careless. There is nobody to bother, no measures to prevent, no
justice. [..] People are dying, but there is no accountability. The rulers are
busy milking the nation. They don't bother at all.

He hits the nail in the coffin:

> এই পোড়ার দেশে কিছুই তাই দাঁড়ায় না। কম মানুষই যাত্রা শেষ করতে পারে। তার
> আগেই মৃত্যু এসে নিয়ে যায়। বিকাশের ধারা অজস্র যতিতে ছারখার। নৈরাজ্য, অপঘাত,
> আত্মঘাত আর অবসাদে শেষ হয়ে যাচ্ছি আমরা। আমাদের আত্মবিশ্বাস বারবার তলানিতে
> চলে যায়। আশার সমাধিতে আমরা অপেক্ষা করি।

Nothing stands in this wretched country. Few people can end their journey
before death engulfs them. The path of development is hindered by a lot of
stops. We are being doomed by frustration, anarchy, accidents, suicidal
thoughts and tiredness. Our self belief is going down. We wait at the burial
of hope.
