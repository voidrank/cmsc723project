Confident, charismatic, and ever so dashing, Sakamoto Ryoma (坂本龍馬) has always
been one of Japan's favorite historical figures. Since NHK started to
broadcast the historical drama series _Ryomaden_ (龍馬伝: ‘The Legend of Ryoma’)
this January, a nation-wide Ryoma boom has exploded.

Official Website for Ryomaden

Called a “renaissance samurai” in [a biography](http://www.amazon.com/Ryoma-
Renaissance-Samurai-Romulus-Hillsborough/dp/0966740173) by researcher Romulus
Hillsborough, Ryoma was a key figure involved in overthrowing the Tokugawa
Shogunate. The movement, fueled by the mounting risk of Western colonization,
ended almost 300 years of feudal rule. Japan charged headfirst into becoming
an industrialized country under a modern government headed by the Emperor,
with doors open to foreign trade. The Psychology Masters blog offers a
[detailed description](http://www.psychologymasters.org/ryoma-sakamoto-
renaissance-samurai/) of Ryoma's life and historical significance.

_Ryomaden_ is simply the most recent in the long line of books, movies, and TV
shows based on the man. “Every year the television network produces one
gorgeous high-budget historical period drama called the Taiga Drama”,
[explains](http://www.peterpayne.net/2010/01/ryoma-sakamoto-renaissance-
samurai.html) Peter Payne. The Jdrama Weblog provides [a list and
comprehensive explanation of the main
characters](http://jdramas.wordpress.com/2009/12/22/ryomaden/). _Ryomaden_
will be shipped to other countries, too – Funn happily [reports](http://all-
about-masha.blogspot.com/2010/06/ryoma-den-airing-in-other-countries.html)
that the series will air in Taiwan with Chinese subtitles and possibly Korea,
Thailand and Vietnam.

The present day perception of Ryoma is said to be shaped mainly by Ryotaro
Shiba's historical novel _Ryoma ga Yuku_ (竜馬がゆく: “Ryoma moves ahead”). As
[pigrilm_reader](http://www.geocities.jp/pilgrim_reader/hero/tosa_1.html)
explains:

> 青春歴史小説である『竜馬がゆく』は、『坂の上の雲』と並んで紛れもなく司馬遼太郎の代表作である。
> この小説を人生の一冊として挙げる日本人は特に多く、また功成り名を遂げた政治家や経営者が後輩に薦める一冊としても、この作品が選ばれる場合が圧倒的に多い。戦後に生きた多くの日本人を魅了し、
> 心を励まし続けてきた、まさに国民的な歴史長編と言える。

Ryōtarō Shiba's masterpiece is, without a doubt, the historical novel _Ryoma
ga Yuku_ , alongside _Saka no Ue no Kumo_. There are many Japanese who will
name this book as their bible in life. It is also overwhelmingly the most
popular book recommended to the younger generation by politicians and business
leaders who have achieved fame and fortune. The book captivated and
wholeheartedly cheered on the spirit of people who lived in post war Japan.
This historical series is indeed a national novel.

One of the most famous spots to visit is [Katsurahama Park in Kochi
Prefecture](http://www.city.kochi.kochi.jp/soshiki/39/ryomazou.html) [ja],
which boasts a large bronze statue of Ryoma looking out to the sea. The
Citynet blog reports that there's [a temporary
tower](http://citynet.blog90.fc2.com/blog-entry-368.html) [ja] set up so
visitors can get closer to the statue.

> それにしても空前の龍馬ブームである。高知は以前から観光も龍馬頼みで、空港の名も高知龍馬空港。そして「龍馬伝」の経済効果は４０９億円で高知県の県内総生産の2%というから相当なものだ（自分の給料が2%増えたことを考えるとその効果の程がわかる）。私は、高知で11年暮らしたので坂本龍馬の高知での人気ぶりは知っている。しかしこの全国的な人気はどうだ。ブームに便乗して稼げる内に稼ごうという姿勢が丸見えの地域もあらわれている。自民党から共産党まで、保革を問わず政治家は龍馬を口に出していればまず安心である。

The country is going through an unprecedented Ryoma boom. Kochi has always
relied on Ryoma for tourism purposes. Even our airport is called [Kochi Ryoma
Airport](http://www.kochiap.co.jp/). Making up 2% of Kochi Prefecture's gross
production and 40.9 billion JPY nation-wide, the economic effect of the drama
_Ryomaden_ is huge. (The fact that my salary increased by 2% might give you an
idea of its effect!) Having lived in Kochi for 11 years, I'm familiar with his
popularity here but I'm not so sure about this national boom. Some places are
transparent in their intent to make money while it can by riding the wave.
From the Liberal Democratic Party to the Japanese Communist Party, politicians
on both sides of the spectrum seem to think they're safe as long as they
mention Ryoma.

Why does Ryoma command so much love and respect? Jon [digs into this
question](http://toshogu.blogspot.com/2010/04/sakamoto-ryoma-and-meiji-
restoration.html) in his review of _[Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji
Restoration](http://www.amazon.com/Sakamoto-Ryoma-Restoration-Marius-
Jansen/dp/0231101732)_ by Marius Jansen.

Here is another reason given at [a thread on Q&A site Yahoo!
Chiebukuro](http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1210421882).
The corporation refers to is the naval trading company
[Kaientai](http://everything2.com/title/Kaientai). Ryoma's associate [Iwasaki
Yataro](http://www.mitsubishi.com/e/history/series/yataro/index.html) would go
on to build the Mitsubishi empire.

> 龍馬が日本で初めて株式会社を設立したのは知っていますか。おそらく当時の日本で龍馬は突出した経済感覚を持っていた人物だったでしょう。つまり金儲けの才能がずば抜けていた。その才能を自分だけの利益のためでなく日本全体のために働かせようとしていたところが尊敬されるのでしょう。  
>  そういった意味で龍馬が若くして死んでしまったことは残念でなりません。

Did you know that Ryoma was the founder of the first modern corporation in
Japan? I'd say that he was ahead of his time in terms of business sense – his
moneymaking skills were outstanding. That Ryoma used his talent for the good
of the country, rather than for himself, is why he is so respected. You can't
help but wonder what could have been, had he hadn't died so young.

  

Preview of the second season of _Ryomaden_

One of the most publicly enthusiastic fans is [Masayoshi
Son](http://www.softbank.co.jp/en/info/profile/officer/member_01/), founder
and CEO of the telecom giant Softbank. Random fact: [Softbank's
logo](http://www.softbank.co.jp/en/info/history/identity/) is based on that of
Ryoma's trading company Kaientai (海援隊). Last year, @masason
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/masason/status/7028007775):

> 来年の大河ドラマは、坂本龍馬。私が最も尊敬する偉人です。 日本の夜明けのために命をかけた。立派なことだと思います。
> 事業を通じて少しでも龍馬さんの心境に近づけたらいいなあと思います。

Next year's NHK Taiga drama is about Sakamoto Ryoma, a man that I respect more
than anyone else in the world. He staked his life on the dawning of Japan's
tomorrow. This is such an admirable thing to do. Through my own enterprise, I
strive to reach closer to Ryoma-san's mindset.

In 1863, Ryoma wrote in a letter to his elder sister, “I want to cleanse Japan
once again.”

The letter was exhibited this spring at [Edo-Tokyo Museum](http://www.edo-
tokyo-museum.or.jp/kikaku/page/2010/0427/0427.html) [ja] this spring as part
of an exhibition to commemorate the NHK drama series. TJ Orosa reviewed the
exhibition [here](http://theoben.blogspot.com/2010/06/sakamoto-ryoma.html).

While the words have been over-quoted lately, especially in the [political
scene](http://ampontan.wordpress.com/2008/03/06/sentaku-getting-japan-to-
choose-a-cleaning/), the sentiment hits close to our hearts.
