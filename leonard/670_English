Metro Manila, the national capital region of the Philippines, is now
experiencing [a water shortage crisis with millions enduring water supply
rationing](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100720-282084/Water-
crisis-may-worsen). Desperate for a bath, disgruntled residents have taken to
[breaking a water pipe in Malabon
City](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20100721-282378/Waterless-
Malabon-residents-break-pipe-to-bathe). Filipino bloggers try to make sense of
the crisis.

_Blackshama's blog_ finds the fact [this rationing is done during the rainy
season](http://blackshama.blogspot.com/2010/07/manila-in-water-crisis-painter-
of.html) worrisome.

> August is historically the wettest month. Unless weather patterns change,
> next month may be the driest August. September is the last month of the wet
> season and then the dry begins. The only thing to be done is to lessen water
> use.

This shortage also came in the wake of the recent onslaught of the Typhoon
“Basyang” (international codename: Conson). _Window To my Soul_ is [“going
nuts”](http://idunnomyworld.blogspot.com/2010/07/water.html) over the lack of
water.

> Wait, we do have water, btw. However, water pressure is too weak that it
> doesn't go up. It does not reach my room. My washroom does not have water.
> The faucets in it have not released a single drop since the storm [Typhoon
> Basyang]. So that's roughly 6 days of being waterless. I have to fetch water
> all the way down from the basement.

_I am Hybrid Cha_ [shares her own water shortage
experience](http://charliehotelalpha.blogspot.com/2010/07/metro-manila-water-
crisis-to-worsen.html).

> This is really pain for me, for all of us and I absolutely am extending my
> patience the farthest I could because I do not have any choice (smile!).
> Plates, utensils, pans and glasses unwashed, left in the kitchen sink
> overnight; not having a good and indulgent bath (since water arrives
> (arrives???) at 6 AM and leaves (leaves??? visitor it is!) around 1 PM) for
> work; I wanted to take a short and comfy shower (when I feel like it) but
> since there is no water well what can I do but endure that sticky and messy
> feeling. There are things that I so want to do, things that are part of my
> routine that I could no longer do these past few days (since Thursday
> evening, July 15th to be exact!) because water just would not cooperate.

_Let's Go Pinoy_ also shares [a personal
experience](http://letsgopinoy.blogspot.com/2010/07/more-water-crisis.html)
which he thinks is connected to the water crisis.

> although our faucets continue to provide our much-needed water supply,
> yesterday the water that was coming out was a light brown color! I thought
> at first it was from the dirty pail and washed it both inside and out and
> then after several rinses, I realized that it was the water itself. It's
> still that way this morning but not as brown. Because of this I didn't want
> to take my bath yesterday. But the heat and my stickiness from sweating got
> the better of me and I used the water to bathe.

_Pinoy Buzz III_ [recommends
measures](http://pinoybiz.blogspot.com/2010/07/dealing-with-water-crisis.html)
that the government can take to solve the water shortage problem in the long-
run.

> 1\. All buildings should be retrofitted so that it will be able to recycle
> the water it uses for its sinks and toilet bowls.
>
> 2\. All buildings should start storing rainwater.
>
> 3\. All commercial establishments and private residences must have a waste
> water treatment facility. Smaller establishments can opt to have a communal
> waste water treatment facility, larger establishments may have their own.
>
> 4\. Ban the development of new golf courses and inland water resorts.
>
> 5\. Start the construction of desalination plants…
>
> 6\. Start the construction of water recovery facilities along the Pasig
> River and in Laguna de Bay.

According to the _Radical's Nut_ , [the water shortage
crisis](http://arnoldpadilla.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/water-shortage-in-metro-
is-beyond-el-nino/) goes beyond the El Niño phenomenon and would not have been
as bad “if not for structural issues related to the privatization of the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) almost 13 years ago.”

> Among the many promises made by the private water concessionaires and hyped
> by the then Ramos administration was upgrading the decrepit water system
> infrastructure. Such upgrade intends to substantially reduce non-revenue
> water (NRW, or water lost due to leaks and pilferage) and help achieve
> universal and 24/7 water supply for an increasing number of households. In
> their original concession agreement with MWSS, the private water firms
> promised to provide universal access by 2001.
>
> But until today, less than 60 percent of 790,000 households in Maynilad’s
> service area have 24-hour water service while only 74 percent receive water
> at 7-pound per square inch (PSI) or stronger pressure ([read
> here](http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508893&publicationSubCategoryId=66)).
> More than half (53 percent) of water allocated to Maynilad continues to get
> wasted because of leaks and pilferage ([read here](http://www.abs-
> cbnnews.com/business/06/23/10/maynilad-cuts-water-loss))…
>
> There is no available data that break down NRW into leaks and pilferage. But
> the continued pervasiveness of illegal connections may be explained by
> skyrocketing water bills due to full-cost recovery under water
> privatization. Since MWSS was privatized, Maynilad’s basic charge has
> already soared by 449 percent and Manila Water, by 845 percent. Put that in
> a situation of worsening job scarcity, stagnant wages and income, and rapid
> increases in the overall cost of living and you will get the picture.
