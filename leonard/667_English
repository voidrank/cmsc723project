The diaspora of the developing countries worldwide is often mentioned by
development experts as a potential driving factor for poverty reduction and
the francophone region is no exception. In fact, two conferences are taking
places in the upcoming months in
[Cameroon](http://www.afriqueavenir.org/2010/07/06/le-cameroun-abritera-en-
aout-le-premier-forum-economique-et-commercial-de-la-diaspora/) and
[Mali](http://www.farafinamag.fr/index.php?page=news&id=459) about the role of
diaspora in supporting development in their respective countries [fr]. Still,
the current suggested policies to promote more involvement from the diaspora
are not without controversies and require more channels to facilitate
collaborations between all development actors (local NGOs, private sector,
international agencies and government).  
_Farafina_ __ outlines the goal of the conference in Mali and how they foresee
the [diaspora contributing to
development](http://www.farafinamag.fr/index.php?page=news&id=459) in Mali
[fr]:

> Le _Forum Tremplin_ propose de rencontrer sur leurs stands des entreprises
> et cabinet de recrutements du Mali, d'Afrique et de France dans les domaines
> de l'informatique, la banque-assurance, les  
>  industries pour le compte d'entreprises (reconnues), en tout 200 emplois
> (seront disponibles)

The _Forum Tremplin_ offers a gathering place for companies and recruiting
agencies in Mali, Africa and France in the fields of information technology,
banking, insurance and other industries for renowned companies. In total, 200
positions (will be available)

In Cameroon, the conference that will take place in Yaounde from August
11-13th 2010, wants to [draw inspiration from diaspora
](http://www.afriqueavenir.org/2010/07/06/le-cameroun-abritera-en-aout-le-
premier-forum-economique-et-commercial-de-la-diaspora)from other African
nations [fr]:

> Sous le thème, “La diaspora camerounaise, un véritable acteur du
> développement”, il sera question pour les participants, de chercher les
> voies et moyens pour amener la diaspora camerounaise à s’impliquer davantage
> dans le processus de développe­ment économique du pays. Pour le MECAM, « à
> l’instar des pays comme le Mali ou le Sénégal, où l’on sent une réelle
> implication de la diaspora dans le développement économique, la diaspora
> ca­merounaise qui apporte déjà beaucoup, le fera davantage dans un cadre
> réglemen­taire »

The theme of the conference is “The Cameroonian diaspora, a true agent of
development”. The idea is for all participants to find ways and means to bring
the diaspora into committing further in the economic development of the
country. According to the MECAM (Ministry of Economy and Commerce): just like
in Mali or Senegal, where one can feel a true engagement by the diaspora in
the economic development, the Cameroonian diaspora is certainly already
bringing a lot to the table, but it would be able to do more within the
regulated structure.

In Senegal, _Ferdinand Mayega_ believes that for the Diaspora to effectively
help the country, a [focus on education ](http://www.leral.net/L-avenir-de-l-
Afrique-la-diaspora-intellectuelle-interpellee-de-Ferdinand-
Mayega_a9735.html?utm_source=Dame+DIENG&utm_medium=leral&utm_campaign=Groupe+leral&utm_term=S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal&utm_content=Dakar)and
intellectual exchange to augment the knowledge capital and reach the tipping
point towards development is key [fr]:

> Tout ce challenge doit se faire dans un environnement propice au progrès et
> aux débats d’idées en associant les universitaires et chercheurs vivant en
> Afrique. Il peut s’agir de créer des masses critiques, des regroupements ou
> des pôles d’excellence pour le décollage de l’Afrique.

The challenge is that all of this must happen in an environment that is
favorable to progress and to the exchange of ideas and engage scholars and
researchers who reside in Africa. It is about reaching a critical mass of
centers or hubs with top-notch quality of ideas for Africa to take off.

In a presentation on knowledge management in Morocco, _Othmane Bouhali_
stresses out that there are [specific know-hows on grid computing and supra-
conductivity](http://www.partager-le-
savoir.org/template/fs/Chania/conferences/bouhali.pdf) the Moroccan diaspora
have acquired that they should voluntarily offer to share with others back
home [fr]:

> faire appel aux différentes compétences de la diaspora marocaine, pour
> accomplirdes missions, sur place et /ou à distance, en appui ou dans le
> cadre des programmes de développement de leur pays d’origine, sur la base du
> volontariat et d’un engagement déontologique.

One must call onto the various expertises of the Moroccan diaspora to
accomplish missions, on site or remotely, to support or within the structure
of development program in their country of origin. This must be done on
voluntary basis driven by a commitment based on deontology.

The role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in development through which
most diaspora operate, have been intensely debated in Haiti, especially as the
country is embattled in the recovery process after the [recent catastrophic
earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/haiti-
earthquake-2010/). _Alice Backer_ reports on a recent conference, [Cardicis,
~~that offered a few policy suggestions~~ where folks debated the relationship
between the Haitian Gvt and international
NGOs](http://www.kiskeacity.com/2010/06/cardicis3-day-1-debate-about-role-
of.html) :

> They explained that the larger NGOs have no interest in involving the
> Haitian government which hurts Haiti and its people. And the kicker: someone
> suggested NGOs should be nationalized to make them part of a government led
> system. The government could then coordinate and oversee the reconstruction
> effort while regaining a central role.

Similar to Haiti, _Sipakv_ notes that the role of diaspora for Madagascar has
always been debated intensively, given its relatively important size. She also
remarks that, just like the proposal in Haiti, the African Union suggested
that [NGOs could be represented in some kind of governmental
capacity](http://www.haisoratra.org/gasycool/?p=312) [fr]:

> Il paraitrait que la diaspora a bien un role a jouer, l’Union Africaine le

It appears that the diaspora has a role to play in development, the African
Union says so in its Report of the conferences of the Diaspora and African
NGOs on the popularization of science and technology, available
[here](http://www.africa-
union.org/root/AU/Conferences/Past/2006/November/HRST/Science-
tec/EXT.AU.EXP.ST.6\(II\)%20-%20Report%20-%209th%20AfriCANDO%20Hemispherical%20Summit.doc):  
“Providing human and technical resources;  
Lobbying governments, institutions, and foundations to support the programs;  
Being represented in government structures; (aha !)  
Providing advice on policies and technical issues;  
and Participating in networks to benefit communities and nations in the
Diaspora”  
… It is a bit controversial for them to suggest that the diaspora should be
integrated in the governmental structures. I don't even want to think about
the practical implications of such initiatives.

There is some ideas to be explored further there says _Apolo Ndyabahika on a
post entitled “What Africa Needs” on Project Diaspora_. The only way diaspora
can effectively help with investment in projects back home is [if government
build the foundations of solid legislative
regulations](http://projectdiaspora.org/2010/05/25/what-africa-needs/) to
reassure the diaspora and other investors:

> our governments are starting to realize the importance of good legislation
> that protects local and foreign investments. As African countries work to
> lure investors to our lands we are challenged by investors to have strong
> property rights to protect their investments. Tanzania is in the process of
> working to use investment bonds to fund massive infrastructure project like
> a multi-billion dollar railway line to Rwanda. A limitation to this and
> other international investment is their weak legislation.

The controversial idea of NGOs getting more integrated with government work is
not as big of a controversy when compared to the reactions towards [economist
Romer's proposal for reducing global
poverty](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-politically-
incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty/8134/), recently published in _the Atlantic_
journal. The fragile legislative structure of some developing countries is
also at the core of Romer's argument that advocates for creating cities within
countries that would be under the administration of foreign entities in order
to give them more control over their investments. Romer proposed such projects
to be implemented in Madagascar with the [leasing of large amounts of farm
lands to foreign
entities](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/23/madagascar-south-korean-
land-deal-sparks-controversy/) and it may [have played a role
](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-politically-
incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty/8134/)in the [ensuing political
crisis](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/madagascar-power-
struggle-2009/):

> Romer made his pitch for a charter city, and Ravalomanana responded that he
> wasn’t sure one was enough; if Romer could identify two rich countries
> willing to play the role of government trustee, it might be better to launch
> two parallel experiments.[..] Barely a year after launching his venture,
> Romer was on the brink of a rare coup: a nation of 20 million people was
> about to embrace a neo-medieval, neo-colonial scheme untested in the modern
> history of development. But then a different sort of coup occurred—the kind
> of coup, unfortunately, that underscores the obstacles to Romer’s project.

_Teddy MS Ruge_ , founder of [Project Diaspora](http://projectdiaspora.org),
was not pleased with Romer's idea and the all-too-common assumption that
foreign groups would know better how to develop a country and overlook local
talents and the diaspora. He asks on [twitter about Romer's proposal and the
situation in Madagascar](http://twitter.com/tmsruge/status/17094552920):  
[![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/TMS-Ruge-
twitter-375x188.jpg)](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2010/07/TMS-Ruge-twitter.jpg)  
Ruge's question is certainly pertinent to the debate on strategy for poverty
reduction from all around the developing world and the empowerment of their
citizens. It also remains unclear why some regions have lagged behind others
when it comes to harnessing the potential of their respective diaspora to
stimulate development.
