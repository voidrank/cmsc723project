A new era of filmmakers are finding their feet in Cuba, according to an
[article published in The New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/movies/digital-technology-is-making-
its-mark-in-cuba.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&) [en]. The article tells the story
of Sebastián Miló, a Cuban director that “hardly had enough money to put
petrol in the old bus that took his team to film the series everyday, let
alone enough to pay the salaries of the actors.”

> But Mr. Miló, a 33-year-old Cuban filmmaker, had a Canon 5D digital  
>  camera and a story to tell. So, during one frenetic week in May 2011,  
>  he shot “Truckdriver,” a tense 25-minute film about bullying at one of  
>  the vaunted rural boarding schools where millions of Cubans used to  
>  spend part of their high school education

It seems that acclaimed filmmakers and new directors have started to take over
new technologies to keep down the costs of production of audiovisual effects
and to tell stories that would otherwise not have seen the light of day.

During the premier of the 2010 film “El Benny”, the director Jorge Luis
Sánchez, [said](http://www.juventudrebelde.cu/cultura/2010-09-18/nuevas-
tecnologias-benefician-al-joven-cine-cubano/) [es]:

The article in The New York Times also refers to Carlos Lechuga, a 29 year-old
filmmaker and director of the independent film “Melaza.” The film was [judged
by the Cuban critic Dean Luis
Reyes](http://www.ipscuba.net/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6099:de-la-
ausencia-como-estilo&Itemid=11) [es] to tell “a new story of typical survival
of national cinema.”

The project won various awards, including the Hubert Bals fund for script
development, the Cinergia fund for a debut production, and the Ibermedia
programme that allowed him to “somewhat face his financing issues”, [declared
](http://www.ipscuba.net/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=308:loco-por-el-
cine&Itemid=11)[es] Lechuga.

“The Cubans are making feature length films, shorts, documentaries and
animation films often with nothing more than a few friends and some budget
teams – and with little help from the state and the Cuban Institute for Film
and Film Industry,” concluded The New York Times.
