Unrest in Libya continues after over a week of protests defying ruler Colonel
Gaddafi and fierce [crackdowns on
protestors](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/17/libya-gaddafi-cracks-
down-on-anti-regime-protestors/) by the authorities.

A tweet from
[@LaraABCNews](http://twitter.com/#!/LaraABCNews/status/40807040523841536)
says it all:

> Depending on where you are in #Libya it's either calm or chaos – people in
> Benghazi say they're back to work, banks & supermarkets open.

CNN has [reported](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgP0Gro52c8) a huge rally in
second largest city Benghazi, and the first edition of the city's new
newspaper has [hit the
stands.](http://www.4shared.com/document/2CDWtEkD/-_-_.html)

The story is very different in the capital Tripoli, which is said to be the
last stronghold of the four-decade rule of [Muammar Al
Gaddafi](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Muammar_al-Gaddafi).

As forces began descending on Tripoli, Gaddafi spoke to the nation promising
to kill protesters and clean Libya “[house by
house](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/world/africa/23libya.html).” If these
are, in fact, the last hours of Gaddafi's regime, these are nervous hours.
Especially for those with roots in Libya.

On Thursday, February 24, 2011, large swaths of the country have reportedly
fallen to opposition protesters and defecting military units. People are
beginning to document human rights violations allegedly carried out by forces
loyal to Gaddafi.

Regardless of what you think about the effectiveness of social media in
organizing and keeping alive protests throughout the Middle East, these tools,
along with [some](http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/02/using-fax-
machines-to-route-ar.php) analog devices, have proved useful documenting some
human rights violations.

As one tweep explains to the outside world:

The documentation also takes the form of video.

This video, uploaded by
[ibntarabulus](http://www.youtube.com/user/ibntarabulus) and created by the
group [One Day on Earth](http://www.youtube.com/user/onedayonearthvideos#g/a),
shows a mass burial in Tripoli.

This [video](http://www.youtube.com/user/MeddiTV#p/a/u/2/qBtHZT36GfY)
(GRAPHIC), called “Derna Libya Soldiers Killed for Not Killing Their Own,” was
uploaded to Youtube by [MeddiTV](http://www.youtube.com/user/MeddiTV) on
Wednesday, February 23, 2011. The video shows perhaps as many as 30 soldiers
face-down, most of them with bound hands. All of them were shot, some multiple
times.

This [video](http://tinyurl.com/4fek7hn) (GRAPHIC), called “Executed Soldiers
– Sirt Libya (Refused to Kill their own People) جنود تم اعدامهم ,” shows the
same footage.
