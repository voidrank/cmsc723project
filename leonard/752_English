In the [Gulf of
California](http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/mexico/work/art8618.html),
a body of water that separates the Baja California Peninsula from the Mexican
mainland, there is a great example about how citizen journalism is able to
create environmental consciousness in a community and become a model of
reporting.

_[SuMar “Voces por la naturaleza”](http://www.sumar.org.mx/) _(Your Ocean:
Voices for Nature) is a local association that focuses on Gulf of California’s
conservation, motivating their own community by giving tools to people in
order to become leaders and take action. Citizen journalism is one important
subject, as they have hosted different conferences on writing with an
environmental and social focus. This is what they mention on their[ own
website:](http://www.sumar.org.mx/lineas.html)

> El periodismo comunitario, el arte como medio didáctico y las nuevas
> tecnologías de la comunicación son algunas de las tácticas utilizadas por
> SuMar. Porque una sociedad crítica y propositiva es una sociedad con poder,
> nuestras campañas de comunicación están orientadas a informar a la
> ciudadanía e invitándolos a participar en temas de interés común y con gran
> respaldo técnico y científico.

Community journalism, art as a didactic media and new communication
technologies are some tools used by SuMar. Because a critical and positive
society with power, our communication campaigns are oriented to inform
society, inviting them to participate about subjects with a common interest
for everybody, and with a scientific and technical support.

About 100 teachers and students have been able to become a part of the citizen
journalism project. By discussing these environmental issues, they were
trained how to use citizen media and being trained o act and react to it.
There have also been several conferences about citizen journalism related to
climate change, fishing, ecotourism, etc.

The participants not only focus on writing, but they have also created
[podcasts](http://www.sumar.org.mx/sala_pod.html), [photo
galleries](http://www.sumar.org.mx/sala_galeria.html) and different videos
about what is happening in their own region.

All the podcast episodes begin with this introduction:

> Sobrevivir en el Golfo de California: Promesas incumplidas de la modernidad,
> crisis ambiental y postales cercanas del progreso como ideologia. Una serie
> de reportajes producidos por el _staff_ de política y _rock'n'roll_.

Surviving in the Gulf of California: Broken promises, environmental crisis,
and postcards that bring progress closer, as an ideology. A series of articles
produced by the politics and rock'n'roll staff.

Some of the subjects they cover are local issues, such as [Puerto
Peñasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Pe%C3%B1asco)‘s history (from the
presence of the indigenous communities until the construction of touristic
infrastructure, and fragments from politicians’ speeches), education in the
main area, and migration within the region. However, one of the most important
aspects of these podcasts, is the freedom of the express themselves, as with
its informative perspective that gives a voice to the residents of the Gulf of
California region in order to complain and talk about the issues that are
affecting their own region.

This is a fragment of[ Podcast #8](http://www.sumar.org.mx/sala_pod.html):

> Con sus impresionantes campos de golf, su turismo de sol y playa, con los
> infaltables e innumerables casos de despojos ejidatarios, pescadores y
> pequeños propietarios; por parte de los potentados políticos en turno, el
> denominado Cancún Foxista, Peñasco o Rocky Point para los turistas
> americanos, es uno de los claros ejemplos de la corrupción desarrollista del
> Estado Mexicano.

With its impressive golf courses, sun and beach tourism, with the obligatory
and countless number of cooperatives, fishermen and small businesses; by
different politicians in office, the denominated Cancun Foxista, Peñasco or as
it is known by American tourists: Rocky Point, it is a very clear example of
development corruption inside Mexico.
