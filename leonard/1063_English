In September, Makoto Yuasa, Secretary-general of [Anti Poverty Network
](http://www.k5.dion.ne.jp/~hinky/index.html) (反貧困 Han Hinkon) [ja], had
already pointed to the problem explaining Japan's poverty issue [in this way
](http://www.k5.dion.ne.jp/~hinky/090904article.yuasa.html)[en]:

> Ever since the high economic growth of the 1960s, Japan has inhabited the

As many debate on their blogs, nowadays the income gap in Japan is far from
being new. When the economic Bubble burst in the early 90s it revealed the
weaknesses in the Japanese system and since then many experts say the country
has never completely recovered from recession.  
_Ysaki_ [suggests ](http://eiji.txt-nifty.com/diary/2009/10/post-730a.html
)how this problem has always existed but have been regarded by most Japanese
as a somebody else's problem.

When I read the news I felt that this problem is very similar to that of other
discriminated groups in Japan.  
Although there is certainly a problem and it is one very close to us we
pretend not to see it and in doing so, we have come to convince ourselves that
it is none of our business.

_Miyabi-tale_[considers ](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/miyabi-
tale/20091021/1256088117)that the issue has a long history and that
responsibility must be traced back to political inertia.

> 驚くべきは、この数字が今年ではなくて数年前のデータでさえすでに7人に1人いるという事実で、リーマンショック以降の世界恐慌の不景気のあとでは今現在では少なく見ても5人に1人はそれくらいの値になっていると考えられることである。自民政権下では、公式発表的に「日本に貧困はない」「一億総中流家庭」なんていうキャッチコピーもあったわけだが、現実はまったくそうでないということが改めて浮き彫りにされたわけである。

What's surprising is data from a couple of years ago showed that one person in
seven lived in poverty. There are some who consider it a positive that,
despite the deep recession which affected the whole world as a consequence of
the Lehman Brothers collapse, only one in five people nowadays is poor.  
Under the LPD government, slogans such as ‘In Japan there is no poverty’ or ‘A
total of one hundred million middle-class households’ used to be announced but
it has again become apparent that this was far from being the truth.

There are those though who prefer to consider the other side of the coin.  
_Ukkii_ [hopes](http://ameblo.jp/shiokawa-office/entry-10369752658.html) that
this black period in the Japanese social and economic history would bring a
return of the strength of spirit for which the Japanese people are renowned.

>  貧しかった戦後の日本国民は、みな必死で頑張ってここまでよくなってきています

B U T  
Is it all right for things to go on like this until the country's economy
recovers?  
When the Japanese people were poor after the war, they did their best with no
hesitation and managed to improve the situation as we now know.  
If only we again had the same HUNGRY SPIRIT of that time I am sure that even
if we can't immediately change the whole country, keeping our companies strong
and competitive is still possible.  
I am an employee but I try to see things from a CEO's point of view because if
we are far-sighted, there are many discoveries and improvements to be made,
which can be applied to a variety of things.  
The phrase ‘hungry spirit’ is perhaps forgotten nowadays but I'd like to put
it forward again.
