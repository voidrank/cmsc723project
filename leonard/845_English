[Coltan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coltan), columbo-tantalite, is a mineral
used to make resistors in our cellphones, video games, computers and home
electronics. Likened to [blood
diamonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_diamond), its mining has not only
caused[ ecological damage](http://www.cellular-news.com/coltan/), human rights
abuses, but some say is also[ fueling the conflict in the
Congo](http://www.sprword.com/videos/bloodcoltan/).

First, [ConflictVoice ](http://conflictvoice.org/)points towards __[_Blood
Coltan_ , a 52 minute long documentary by Patrick
Forestier](http://www.javafilms.fr/spip.php?article8). The 2007 film, shows
the ins and outs of the coltan trade, the militia situation and the how the
lives of everyday citizens are affected by this ore they mine sometimes as
their only source of income in impoverished villages isolated from other
settlements, and whose use they might even ignore.

Back in 2006, [we mentioned](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2006/10/13/congo-

Coltan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OWj1ZGn4uM), the [Pulitzer's Center on
Crisis Reporting](http://www.youtube.com/user/PulitzerCenter) documentary
piece on the mineral and the crisis in Congo:

[Global Post posted in late
2009](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/kenya/100118/congo-conflict-minerals-

Coltan miner, a story which might be every single miner's story:

Tristan McConnell, in his Global Post article [_Cell phone minerals fuel
deadly Congo conflict_
](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/kenya/100118/congo-conflict-minerals-
mining)points out why we should care about this issue:

Coltan isn't only produced in DRC, although they are a major source. [Gosier
gives some examples ](http://appfrica.net/blog/2009/12/08/conspicuous-
correlations-coltan-and-crisis-
reports/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=conspicuous-correlations-
coltan-and-crisis-reports)of actions some of the companies using coltan are
taking to ensure they aren't aiding the conflict:

> Many of the worlds leading technology companies use coltan in the consumer
> electronic products we use everyday (the Wii, Playstation, iPhone, Computers
> etc). Since the turn of the century most have implemented measures to ensure
> that most of their coltan is not coming from Congo. Who are some of them?
> Apple, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Sony, Nokia, Nintendo.

However, on the [Conflict Minerals blog](http://conflictminerals.org/coltan-
learning-the-basics/) they have quite a different story regarding the purchase
of coltan from the DRC:

> Once the coltan is processed and converted to capacitors, it is then sold to
> companies such as Nokia, Motorola, Compaq, Alcatel, Dell, Hewlett-Packard ,
> IBM, Lucent, Ericsson and Sony for use in a wide assortment of everyday
> products ranging from cell phones to computer chips and game consoles.

There are others who believe that although conflict and minerals are related,
the approach to seeing the minerals as the source of conflict in Congo and
addressing only that issue is flawed. Such is the case of the [following
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VDcWdI76-o) _Ask the African â€“ Kambale
Musavuli, Friends of the Congo_ :

So what CAN be done about coltan? It seems that at the moment, positive
actions are to pressure consumer product manufacturers to ensure that their
coltan sources are conflict-free and also to keep ourselves informed so
history is not repeated. This becomes quite interesting at this moment,
particularly since it seems that neighboring nations Colombia and Venezuela,
who have a history of conflict and animosity between their presidents, have
discovered coltan [in areas near the
border](http://revistaminera.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/colombia-la-guerra-por-
el-coltan/).
