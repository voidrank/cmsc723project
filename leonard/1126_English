The number of flood casualties continues to rise in the Philippines: Almost
300 dead bodies. More than half a million individuals living in evacuation
centers. And at least 2.5 million Filipinos affected by the flooding caused by
[Typhoon Ondoy](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/28/philippines-
flooding-documented-on-citizen-videos/) which hit Metro Manila and [nearby
provinces](http://www.gmanews.tv/story/173471/five-days-after-storm-many-
communities-are-still-flooded) last Saturday.

This video summarizes the deadly impact of Typhoon Ondoy in Metro Manila and
nearby provinces

Bloggers are sharing their stories on how they survived Typhoon Ondoy. From
_[SingleShutter.com](http://www.singleshutter.com/index44.htm)_ :

> What happened to our house was just unimaginable. It has never flooded in
> our subdivision, but today was a disaster. Started to flood in the street at
> 4pm. Soon water was coming out of the drains and the toilet! So the maid
> started moving the electronics to the 2nd floor. The computers, the camera
> equipment, the LCD TV, she caried them all by herself. The water continued
> to rise so she and our dog Yoshi went to the neighbor's house. They crossed
> the road while the water was chest deep. Yoshi was crying as they were
> crossing the street/river swimming.

_Marikina Travel Buddy_ writes that many city hall employees of Marikina City
were [trapped in the government
building](http://marikinacity.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/my-typhoon-ondoy-
ordeal-4/)

> I passed by Marikina City Hall and it wasn’t spared from nature’s wrath. I
> remembered my friend who works at the City Hall texted me earlier saying
> that they are trapped at the second floor. Flood waters have occupied half
> of the first floor. A lot of important documents were affected and even the
> computers and servers that the City Hall was using are now under water.

_Whiteboard_ mentions that [cars were dragged
away](http://chini.paglalakbay.biz/headline/my-ondoy-tale/) during the storm:

> So there I was, no tv, no computer, my phone’s battery low signal blinking
> every 2 seconds. I learned from people who live nearby that villages in
> Marikina and Cainta are already under several feet of water. People were
> already on their rooftops waiting to be rescued. A relative who lives in
> Greenland said that they just parked the car a few minutes as they fetched
> their children in their home, a few minutes later they realized that the car
> has been dragged by the heavy water current and they had no idea where it
> went.

[Anna was having lunch](http://daily.optimystique.net/2009/10/typhoon-ondoy/)
when floodwaters began to rise:

> In Parañaque, half our village was submerged in murky water. In only a few
> minutes, water was already waist deep outside our gate! The water rose
> faster than we had imagined that we had to abruptly stop in the middle of
> our lunch to start lifting furniture and other equipments to higher spots.
> Thankfully, both our houses were spared with the flood only reaching our
> garage and stopping a mere three inches below our front door.

This video shows that even a popular shopping mall was flooded last weekend:

Like many flood victims, _Pinoy Buzz_ is now focused on [removing the mud and
cleaning the house](http://pinoybiz.blogspot.com/2009/10/ondoy-is-climate-
change.html)

> Since Monday, my wife, her siblings, and a couple of friends have been
> hauling mud out of the house. Along with the mud, we had to haul out all of
> the books that had been turned into pulp, shoes that are now unuseable,
> electric gadgets filled with mud, and a host of other things which are now
> unrecognizable.

Dennis Villegas criticizes the [slow response of government
agencies](http://dennisvillegas.blogspot.com/2009/09/wrath-of-typhoon-
ondoy.html) to distress calls:

> Typhoon Ondoy is a disaster that exposed many hidden weaknesses in the
> government's preparedness for a calamity of this magnitude. Hundreds of
> people were trapped on the roofs of their homes as the flood heightened to
> drown them. They hoped in their heart of hearts that a rescue team will
> somehow emerge from the total darkness and bring them safely to a safe
> ground. But no one came. While people sent messages of help in their soaked
> and dying cellphones pleading for help, the Arroyo government went on
> closed-door meetings and media interviews, where a single second may have
> been significant in saving lives…In this kind of disaster, every second lost
> and may mean lost lives.
>
> Hundreds of people were trapped, but very few rubber boats arrived for
> rescue. Many died, and those who survived had to be sobered by the fact that
> a few more hours of rain would have certainly killed them, had not the rain
> somehow diminished in the night. They had to wait in the morning to be
> rescued, spending the night cold, wet, hungry—but alive.

[Reflection of a flood victim
survivor](http://ronaldredito.org/blog/327/ondoy-typhoon-experience/):

> Times like this, one may say that “I lost everything.” In our case, WE
> REGAINED SOMETHING.
>
> We regained the love and respect for and from each member of our family. We
> regained moments with each other, which we have frequently taken for
> granted…And because they are now living with us, we are now together as one
> family every single day, instead of twice or thrice a week. We’re even
> sharing wi-fi access at home and accessing FB all at the same time.
>
> My Ate says her biggest realization is that she didn’t possess anything.
> Except for some valuables, she’s almost ready to get rid of everything in
> their house
