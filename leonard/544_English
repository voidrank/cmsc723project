[Dar Sketches]( http://darsketches.wordpress.com) is a blog of drawings and
creative writing inspired by ‘street level” Dar es Salaam. The blog will
ultimately be turned into a book.

[The Project background](http://darsketches.wordpress.com/about/):

The project started with an interest in the older buildings of Dar es Salaam
city centre, and a desire to capture some of their essence before they are all
too rapidly demolished. As an artist and illustrator, I believe drawings can
capture a different and sometimes more vibrant image than photographs. While
the architecture creates the context, the vibrancy of Dar street life is a
wonderful, rich and quirky realm all to itself. So the drawings have developed
to include whole street scenes as well as portraits of street vendors,
daladala’s, overloaded bicycles, sign art and much more.

‘Street level’ would like to be a forum for creative writing about Dar es
Salaam. Short stories, poems, musings, even two line thoughts and interesting
facts would be very gratefully received for consideration. Pieces could be
inspired by the artwork or vice versa.

In Praise of Street Vendors by Sarah Markes

> Some grumble about the space taken up by assorted vendors on Dar’s crumbling
> pavements or the apparent disarray of the city’s myriad street stalls, but
> how can you not be grateful for all the goods and services that are at your
> fingertips in every part of the city? Whether it’s an icy cold bottle of
> water thrust through your window in traffic, that Arsenal sticker you have
> always wanted or your bicycle tyre repaired in minutes, Dar’s thriving
> street trade can provide.

> The sweet, sticky heat makes my clothes stick to my skin. I am damp to the
> touch, dripping with the unavoidable refuse of my art. Yes, I am an artist
> my friend, although you may not think so. How else can you explain what I
> do? I walk the town like a vagabond of the vanguard, a viscous fluid in the
> arteries of Bongo streets, providing for your every need.
>
> All it takes is a single look, you know the one, while you inch along in the
> snaking foleni [queue] hoping for some form of respite, and you pleadingly
> glance out your half-rolled down window, I see the yearning in your eyes.
> Before you even know what it is that you desire, I will be there, with
> karanga na maji [groundnuts and water] and perhaps a cigarette or two. I
> will provide. You take what I offer with subtle contempt, annoyed that I
> know you better than yourself, but alas, what is an artist to do?

Light Corner by Sarah Markes

> “Dar’s street scenes tell a story of the city’s history, its people and
> their livelihoods – of the original inhabitants of Mzizima, the Sultans from
> Oman, the Germans, the British, the Indians, waves of immigrants from rural
> Tanzania and its surrounds.

Green Oranges by Sarah Markes

> Juice dribbles slowly down his chin as he grins at me. Otherwise motionless,
> he carefully sucks every last piece of the fruit without breaking his
> smiling gaze. Sparkly eyes above a sun faded yellow football shirt. The dark
> ‘Fly Emirates’ slogan yells silently from his chest.
>
> Casting the skin aside he finally turns and rearranges the baskets on his
> bicycle, crammed full with sweet green oranges to sell in town.
>
> ‘Fly Emirates’ is emblazoned across his back as well. This sinew limbed
> cyclist farmer, advertising one of the richest airlines in the world. His
> shirt has already travelled thousands of miles more than he ever will. I
> doubt he even has a passport, let alone anything more tangible than distant
> dreams of flight.
