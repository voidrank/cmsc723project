Several people were
[injured](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/19/algeria.demonstration/index.html)
as police and pro-government gangs in Algeria confronted protesters while
trying to break up a demonstration organized by human rights organizations and
other civil society groups in Algiers on Saturday, February 19.

There are conflicting reports on the number of protesters who came to May 1
Square for Saturday's demonstration. Al Jazeera English
[reported](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201121943659150329.html)
that hundreds of protesters turned out while a human rights groups
[placed](http://twitter.com/#!/hippodamos/statuses/39088729784205312) the
number at 5,000. Police used sheer numbers and occasionally clubs in an
attempt to keep downtown Algiers open to traffic. The relatively low numbers
of protesters — at least compared to last week's demonstration that brought an
estimated 10,000 protesters and 26,000 riot police — were blamed on the fact
the government has banned large demonstrations. The country's train service
was almost completely shut down.

Opposition parties did not officially attend the February 19 protest.

Protesters in Algeria are demonstrating against
[corruption](http://q.liberation.fr/photo/id/248500), high unemployment and an
a rise in basic goods prices, even though the country is the fourth largest
[exporter](http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Algeria/Background.html) of crude oil
in Africa and an important producer of natural gas. Protesters have also
called for the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has been in
power since 1999, and his supporters changed the constitution so he could run
for election for a third term, which he won in 2009. The government
[says](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/14/algeria.state.of.emergency/)
protesters make up a minority of Algeria's population.

As Loubna Aggoun
[argues](http://twitter.com/#!/laggoun/status/39053831442661376) that certain
aspects of Algerian politics will make a complete change difficult:

However, the country's Prime Minister said by the end of February it will lift
a state of emergency, which has been in place since 1992. The emergency laws
came into power during the early days of a decade-long civil war that began
after the government cancelled elections which would have been one by the
Islamic Salvation Front. This led to a government takeover by the country's
military — and a violent uprising that lasted until 2002. An estimated 200,000
people died during the conflict.

The country's recent history is a theme in some tweets:
