This whistle is being used by people to call attention for the hunger problem
in the 1 Billion Hungry campaign.

The _[1billionhungry](http://www.1billionhungry.org/ "Official website of
1billionhungry campaign")_ campaign was officially launched in Brazil on
Thursday, July 1st. The purpose of this initiative is to put pressure on
politicians to combat hunger. Sponsored by the Food and Agriculture
Organization,[ FAO](http://www.fao.org/ "UN's Food and Agriculture
Organization"), the global campaign is virtually catching the attention of
audiences everywhere with the help of social media and web tools. There is a
symbol to this campaign, a yellow whistle, which helps audiences to make
themselves noticed.

Blow the yellow whistle and bring the noise!

That's what Brazilian bloggers started doing: they reproduced the release
provided by FAO, as did _[alinemenezes](http://alinemenezes.com/hungry)_ ,
but, digging a little deeper, some elaborate thoughts emerged. Not all
comments are related to the _1billionhungry_ campaign but they are helpful to
see the big picture and try and capture what are the thoughts of bloggers
regarding the hunger debate.

[_Messias Martins_](http://messmartins.blogspot.com/2010/06/amor-e-anti-
amor.html) talked about statistics and posed a question [pt]:

> Para você ter uma idéia o Brasil é o 4º maior país em produção de alimentos
> no mundo. O Brasil é o 6º país no mundo em subnutrição. Para onde vai tanta
> comida?

So that you can have an idea, Brazil is the world's 4th major food producer.
At the same time, the country is the 6th in the undernourished ranking. Where
does all that food go?

[_Wilke Lima_](http://connectbrazil.blogspot.com/2010/05/fome-mundial-um-
marco-sombrio.html) cited [pt] Josette Sheeran, from the United Nations Food
Programme:

> Um mundo faminto é um mundo perigoso…. sem comida as pessoas tem apenas três
> opções: fazer protestos violentos, emigrar ou morrer. Nenhuma dessas opções
> é aceitável

A hungry world is a dangerous one… without food people have only three things
to do: violent protests, migrate or die. None of them is acceptable.

He argued that nations probably know what needs to be done to combat hunger
but [pt]:

> É mais cômodo e mais seguro responsabilizar o crescimento populacional, a
> preguiça do pobre ou ainda as adversidades do meio natural como causas da
> miséria e da fome.

It is more comfortable and safer to blame it on population growth rates, the
laziness of poor people or even environmental odds for the causes of misery
and famine.

_[Zelmar Guiotto](http://zelmar.blogspot.com/2010/07/seguranca-alimentar-e-o-
grande-desafio.html) _and _[Socialismo e
Democracia](http://fmdelacuadra.blogspot.com/2010/07/seguranca-alimentar-e-o-
grande-desafio.html) _have posted on their blogs a report by _Carta Maior_
magazine which presented an interview with french agricultural engineer Marcel
Mazoyer, who stated [pt]:

> A falta de alimentos para grande parte da população é fruto de um processo
> histórico de desenvolvimento agrícola desigual e não pode ser resolvida com
> o simples aumento da produção(…) a parcela da população global que tem menos
> acesso aos alimentos é justamente a dos camponeses.

The lack of food for a great part of the population stems from a historic
process of unequal agriculture development and it cannot be solved by simply
increasing production(…) the share of the global population that has less
access to food are peasants.

Mr. Mazoyer has a point of view on the effects of market practices on the
agricultural activity, as reported by the both bloggers [pt]:

> Atualmente, o mercado equilibra a oferta e demanda daqueles que podem pagar
> e não a oferta e a necessidade.

Currently, the market balances suplly and demand of those who can afford to
pay [for food] and not the balance between supply and necessity.

[Marcão Tilápia – O Pescador](http://marcaopescador.blogspot.com/2010/06/fome-
no-brasil-realidade-brasileira.html), a fisherman blog, discusses some data on
poverty and presents his opinion on the hunger matters in Brazil [pt]:

> (…) existe um conluio disfarçado de grande parte de nossa sociedade
> hipócrita, especialmente a de classe mais “abastada”,usando um simples
> exemplo: PREOCUPAÇÃO EM TRATAR BEM, ANIMAIS DE ESTIMAÇÃO, (não que eles não
> mereçam ) gastando seus recursos financeiros de forma exagerada,em
> detrimento aos seus semelhantes carentes de tudo, que poderiam simplesmente
> ajudar. Na defesa de seus interesses e de ponto de vista, preferem dizer que
> isto é tarefa do Estado ou dos políticos, afinal, para tal foram eleitos,
> considerando a carga tributária que lhes são impostas, cuja arrecadação, não
> recebe prioridade de aplicação em áreas sociais em geral.

(…) there is a hidden covenant by greater part of our hypocrite society,
especially the richer part, [which can be demonstrated ] by a simple example:
caring for pets (not that they don't deserve it), spending resources in an
exagerated fashion, letting behind the most needy peers whom these people
could help. Defending their interests and points of view, they prefer to say
that this is a duty of the State, or one of the politicians’ tasks, after all,
they were elected for that, especially considering the taxes imposed on
society, funds that are not prioritized for financing social areas in general.

_[Earthlingorgeous](http://www.earthlingorgeous.com/2010/06/5-20-less-hungry-
children.html)_ makes a clear statement: the problem goes beyond _not having
enough to eat:_

> Most people think of malnutrition as not having enough to eat. But for many
> of the world’s one billion hungry people, the problem is that they get too
> few of the minerals and vitamins that they need to thrive, physically and
> mentally.

_[Kale](http://povertynewsblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/1-billion-hungry-only-
tells-part-of.html) _puts it in another words:

> The 1.02 billion people only tells us how many are undernourished, it says
> nothing about the millions of people who are “malnourished”, those who do
> eat, but not have a full diet.

According to Jacques Diouf, FAO Director-General, _a hungry man is an angry
man_. The _1billionhungry_ campaign promotes intense video messages by actor
Jeremy Irons, who claims to be [_“mad as
hell_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il_1tEQMwqY "Jeremy Irons mad as hell
\(1billionhungry campaign\)")” because 1 billion people live in chronic
hunger. [Watch his
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FM1Xct7JA0&feature=related) to
understand why FAO's director is equally angry.

Society isn't always aware of how to act. Stop racism, stop war, stop hunger…
So many agendas, so many ways to work for the benefit of the community: by
blogging, volunteering, donating, and so on. Another way to contribute is by
taking part of online petitions, which have gained momentum with the adoption
of e-mails and other web tools. Complementing traditional door-to-door
requests, or even [_innovative
performances_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5CM8n-2mDg&feature=channel "1
Billion Hungry launch event in Italy") in public spaces, petitions now can
reach a global scale. One of the key aspects about _1billionhungry_ is how
easy it is to participate – as simple as filling in a form in the web.
Besides, the communication strategy counts on a website which is written in
multiple languages, in other words, that has global reach. Depending on the
results of this campaign, online communities might have new references for
civic engagement.
