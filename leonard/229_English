Indonesia's commitment to promote religious tolerance has been questioned
again after the Religious Affairs Ministry
[ordered](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/sumatra-buddha-statue-must-go-
ministry/433018) a large Buddhist statue in the Tri Ratna Buddhist monastery
in [Tanjungbalai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Tanjung_Balai), North
Sumatra, to be taken down after some ‘hardliners’ in the area complained
against its presence.

A few months ago, leaders and members from other churches were
[attacked](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/14/indonesia-attack-on-
religious-minorities/) by Muslim ‘fanatics’ which led many people to observe
that religious minorities are being harassed in Indonesia. Indonesia is the
most populated Muslim nation in the world.

The problem in North Sumatra started after a number of people calling
themselves GIB / Gerakan Islam Bersatu (United Islamic Movement) began to
consider the Buddha statue in Tri Ratna a threat to Islamic faith in the city.
They argued that the statue could upstage the city's historical symbol ‘Balai
di Ujung Tanduk’ located in front of it. GIB's letter demanding the removal of
the statue was published in a [Buddhism discussion forum
website](http://wihara.com/forum/topik-umum/9392-tentang-penurunan-patung-
buddha-di-tanjung-balai.html).

A discussion thread was also created to give support to the appeal of the
Buddhist monks to the local government:

> Mohon berikan tekanan kpd Walikota Tanjung Balai SUMUT agar mencabut Surat
> Keputusan ttg Penurunan Patung Budha di Vihara Tri Ratna Tanjung Balai,
> Sumut.

Please provide pressure to the Mayor of Tanjung Balai, North Sumatera, to
revoke the decree about lowering the Buddha statue in Tri Ratna monastery.

Various efforts have been made ​​by the monastery and other sympathetic
parties to prevent the statue from being removed but the Ministry, in the end,
it chose to issue an order against the appeal of the monks.

Veryanto Sitohang, Direktur Eksekutif Aliansi Sumut Bersatu (Executive
Director of The Alliance of North Sumatera United). First, the Alliance
complained to the Mayor, then they went to the local parliament, and then they
proceeded to the Ministry of Religious Affairs, until finally they lobbied in
the House of Representatives. But the group failed to get a satisfactory
answer. That is why many were surprised to learn that the Ministry eventually
decided that the statue should be taken down.

Here are some online reactions: [THE INDONESIAN ANTI DISCRIMINATION

patung-buddha-tanjung-balai-kekerasan-negara-terhadap-

“The state has no right to regulate, moreover unload existing fixtures in
worship places. Removing the Buddha statue in the monastery can be categorized
as a form of religious violence committed by the state. This is an
infringement against the constitution and human rights”, as affirmed by Wahyu
Effendy, General Chairman of Anti-Discrimination Struggle Movement.

Although Buddhism is considered as a minority religion, should the majority
religion oppress the minority? Is it just for Buddhist monks to get an
approval from the religious majority? Where is mutual respect among religions
in this country?

Blogger [_LAPAK INFO_](http://rockypanjaitan.blogspot.com/2010/12/pemkot-
tanjung-balai-memaksa-agar.html) notes that religious pluralism is now dead in
Indonesia:

> INI ADALAH PERUSAKAN TERHADAP KEBEBASAN BERAGAMA, PLURALISME DAN RUNTUHNYA
> BHINEKA TUNGGAL IKA

This is the destruction of religious freedom, pluralism and the collapse of
Unity in Diversity

‘Unity in Diversity’ is Indonesia's national motto.
