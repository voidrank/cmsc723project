Yesterday marked what many called Morocco's “[Day of
Dignity](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/17/morocco-movement-for-
dignity-planned-for-20-february-2011/).” Asking for constitutional reform and
an end to corruption, rather than an overthrow of the monarchy, protesters
were relatively well-received by the government and police which sought to
contain the protests. The protests took place in a number of cities [across
the country](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/20/morocco-across-the-
nation-demonstration/)–most notably Casablanca, Fes, Rabat, and Tangier–and
were largely peaceful, save for some [destruction of
property](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/20/morocco-in-marrakech-
destruction-amidst-peaceful-protest/) in Marrakech and Larache, two cities
with a strong sense of economic inequality.

Blogger Ibn Kafka, a Moroccan who lives abroad, explains why the protests are
taking place:

> What is moving the protesters? Well, it’s not as though Moroccans lack cause
> for protests against their ruler(s). While the UNDP’s human development
> index has improved slightly (Morocco ranks a lowly
> [114th](http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/), up though from 124th in
> [2005](http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR05_HDI1.pdf)) ,[Morocco’s
> achievements are still
> abysmal](http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/MAR.html). On the
> political front, the initial moves towards deepening liberalisation taken
> under King Mohammed VI’s first few years on the throne have now long
> stalled, and the régime is in full reverse gear. The Palace’s smothering
> control of the political and parliamentarian scene has made partisan
> politics irrelevant, while the cronyism of close associates to the King
> (Fouad Ali el Himma, de facto leader of upwardly mobile Parti authenticité
> et modernité ([PAM](http://www.pam.ma/pam/Accueil.aspx)) a.k.a. « [the
> King’s shadow](http://www.maroc-
> hebdo.press.ma/MHinternet/Archives_596/html_596/ombre.html)« , or Mounir
> Majidi, [in charge](http://www.bakchich.info/Les-intrigues-du-grand-
> argentier,03531.html) of the Palace’s ever increasing economic and financial
> interests) fuels cynicism, disillusion and anger. The absolute fraud that is
> Morocco’s judiciary merely compounds the twin problems of corruption and
> repression that have beset Morocco since independence.

Quoting NPR, The View From Fez [sums
up](http://riadzany.blogspot.com/2011/02/moroccan-protests-update.html) the
government's view toward the protests:

> There was no violence because “the government was well-prepared for these
> demonstrations. And what they did is, they tried to contain them rather than
> press them. I mean, they've been saying all along, look, we're accustomed to
> demonstrations in Morocco. We believe in the right to peaceful dissent. They
> went out of their way to maintain a very low police presence.

The blogger also notes:

> At the end of the day, the Moroccan people made a point and the government
> will certainly have taken notice. Analysts around the globe maintain that
> because of the advances made here, that “revolution” is not the agenda, but
> evolution. Many Moroccans would agree.

Twitter user @[mariammaslouhi](http://twitter.com/mariammaslouhi) [adds a
note](http://twitter.com/#!/mariammaslouhi/status/39694351714095104) about the
destruction of property:

> After the peacuful demonstration of the youth of 20th Feb #feb20
> Soccerhooligans attacked buildings in the city of Tanger.

Writer [Laila Lalami](http://lailalalami.com), blogging for _The Nation_ ,
[shares details](http://www.thenation.com/blog/158751/rocking-casbah-moroccos-
day-dignity) on the sentiment of the protests:

> Today, the peaceful protests that took place throughout the kingdom put the
> lie to all the accusations that the pro-government forces had been
> spreading. No one held signs demanding the ouster of the king or offering
> support to the Polisario Front or any other foreign entity. Instead,
> protesters denounced corruption and oppression, and demanded democracy and
> freedom: “Yes to a parliamentary democracy.” “In favor of a democratic
> constitution.” “Accountability for thieves / of money and dignity.” “The
> king reigns, but doesn’t govern.” My personal favorite was the multicolored
> banner that quoted the famed lines of the Algerian poet Tahar Djaout: “If
> you speak, you die. If you stay silent, you die. So speak, and die.” (You

Bill Day of the blog _the a la menthe_ used to live in Morocco and still
follows its politics from afar. He
[writes](http://www.williamsonday.com/morocco/archives/2011/02/is-there-a-
futu.html):

> For the present, news reports suggest that that the focus of the protests in
> Morocco is reform not revolution. So it appears that Mohammed VI is facing a
> Louis XVI moment. Confronted with popular demands for reform after the
> storming of the Bastille and the establishment of the National Assembly,
> Louis elected instead to attempt to flee France in search of Austrian
> support to reassert his absolute authority. From the moment he was captured
> and forced to return to Paris under a humiliating guard, the tide of history
> turned against him, leading to his ultimate execution.
>
> Mohammed VI may still have an opportunity to be Morocco's greatest monarch,
> the one who let his people go and guided them to a true democracy, even if
> in the guise of a constitutional monarchy. But to keep his position, he must
> give up his power. This would be a great gift to the Moroccan people. The
> only question is whether Mohammed VI is wiser than Louis XVI.
