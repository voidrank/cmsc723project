Being a road engineer in Russia must be a nightmare. The combination of harsh
climate, mud and marshlands, with annual frost and thaw, makes the upkeep of
many roads next to an impossible task. In spring, some roads simly float off.
Recently, Russian roads were ranked #125 out of 139 in the world by the World
Economic Forum's [2011-2012 Global Competitiveness
Report](http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-2011-2012/).

One might assume that most Russians would have resigned to the task, but,
whereas in a country like Canada, with similar conditions, few eyebrows are
raised, in Russia roads have become a stain on national pride, in man's
constant struggle to tame the forces of nature. Thus, last year, the then
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
[announced](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/30/vladimir-putin-road-
building-programme) a massive road construction programme, to double the rate
of building.

A screenshot of the Ura.ru campaign website “Make bureaucrats work” with
fitting quotation: “Road reconstruction is our main task”.

As with most overambitious plans, Russians exercise some sound skepticism to
its realization, and instead are beginning to take matters into their own
hands, as in the case of
[Yekaterinburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg) – Russia's fourth
largest city.

“Make the bureaucrat work!” is the slogan of [a local
campaign](http://ura.ru/roads/) [ru] run by the regional Internet news agency,
[Ura.ru](http://ura.ru). Their solution to the road problem is as simple as it
is elegant: They simply spray-paint the portraits of local dignitaries around
potholes, with quotes of their promises to fix the problem, and guess what –
problem solved!

What has taken local politicians years not to do, is now done overnight. The
embarrassment of having their portraits so concretely fixed to the potholes of
their power, has seemingly made authorities run about like mad to pave over
their portraits of impotence, filling the holes in streets and roads.

So, what have been the reactions in the Russian social media?

Twitter user @ekalmurzaeva [shouts

> Вот как заставляют работать чиновников! Портреты чиновников помогли

That's how to make bureaucrats work! Portraits of bureaucrats helped repair
the road.

LJ user salvatoreha underlines the efficiency of the campaign, but also
[points out](http://salvatoreha.livejournal.com/461475.html) [ru] that it was
not a one-hit overnight victory:

> Напомним, что художники нарисовали на дорогах городских чиновников, причем
> ямы и пробоины попадали им в рот. Акция оказалась не только эффектной, но и
> эффективной. Сначала коммунальные службы закрасили рисунки либо удалили слой

> чинить!» К утру коммунальщики полностью заделали все дыры.

Remember how artists painted city officials on the roads, with pits and holes
filling their mouths. The action proved not only effectful, but also
efficient. At first, municipal services either painted over the pictures or
removed a layer of asphalt. At night [campaign] initiators left additional
graffiti “To paint over isn't the same as fixing!” By morning, municipality
workers had fully patched all holes.

Yekaterinburg LJ user Ivan Dmitriyev
[adds](http://svetazaharova.visibli.com/share/3eOMA6) [ru] some local colour
and humour to the affaire:

> Десятки информагенств осветили данную акцию. Но в администрации города

Dozens of news agencies highlighted this action. But the city administration
reacted with humour to what had happened, and said that [Governor] Yevgeny
Kuyvashev was to take an evening stroll through the city, and that he was
curious to take a look at one of the caricatures. But some senior municipal
official still decided not to traumatize the psyche of his boss. Already by
next morning all the holes were patched up, asphalt laid, and the faces, with
screaming mouth holes, were consequently painted over.

The result was achieved – done deal, no holes. What a blessing to one's
hometown. Apparently, when bureaucrats close their eyes to city problems, it
is necessary to disclose them, because to their own “ranks”, as the
Yekaterinburg example shows, they remain in awe.

What is not said is often more interesting than what is actually said.
Critical voices to the “Make the bureaucrat work!” campaign are hard to find
in social media. As noted by one blogger, even the attacked politicians appear
to look positively on the action, making their bureaucracy get down to work.

As a matter of fact, the method seems so efficient that one wonders how long
it will take before the campaign is taken to a countrywide scale, possibly by
the lively Russian motorists’ movement. As Russia's legislators and police
clamp down on political rights these days, perhaps this campaign indicates the
growth of alternative popular action, a spontaneously evolving civil society,
aimed at solving actual problems in people's everyday lives.
