Many people live their lives without an opportunity to look at everyday things
from unusual perspective. Sometimes it takes traveling abroad to better
understand what you have or don't have at home. But sometimes it takes a
foreigner blogging about her experiences in a hospital to pinpoint the
“shocking truth” about your country.

Although “a foreigner” may not be the most accurate description of a blogger
[_dorinem_](http://dorinem.livejournal.com/profile)[RUS] who was born in
Ukraine and spent there 16 years before moving to Israel where she found a new
home in 1993. The young women speaks perfect Russian and knows her way around
the former Soviet Union. She recently traveled to Russia to visit her
relatives. But sudden bleeding changed her travel plans and she found herself
in a hospital in [Voronezh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronezh) [ENG], a
city in southwestern Russia.

_Dorinem_ described her adventures in the Russian hospital on LiveJournal.com,
the most popular blogging platform in the country. The blog posts became
popular within days. Her recollections and quotes ended up on the pages of
newspapers and magazines. Discussions that started on her blog grew into
nation-wide debates on the quality of health care in Russia. And although
everything that _dorinem_ described is nothing new for many citizens of
Russia, it took an outraged outsider to make people realize that getting used
to something horrible doesn't make it normal.

The woman got sick in Voronezh on Saturday when it turned out to be extremely
difficult to find any professional help. Here is how she described her first
experience in the hospital:

> Пока ждали, я смотрела по сторонам, и глаза мои лезли на лоб. Во-первых,
> люди, привезенные на «скорой», вылезали из «скорой» и ковыляли в регистрацию
> на своих двоих (кстати, совсем не маленькое расстояние). Иногда привезенные
> просто не могли этого сделать, и тогда по всему покою бегали санитары с
> криками «Нужна каталка!», а им отвечала тетка: «Каталок нет!!!», и так
> несколько раз по кругу. Те же счастливцы, которым каталка все же досталась,
> лежали на абсолютно голой незастеленной поверхности, причем раздевали для
> осмотра их иногда прямо в коридоре или в кабинете при открытой двери,
> поэтому за время ожидания мне пришлось лицезреть интимные органы нескольких
> людей, при том, что я совсем не собиралась этого делать. Кроме того, я
> видела, как везли кого-то на каталке, при этом постоянно нехило так врезаясь
> в углы, так что съехавшего человека постоянно приходилось поправлять, чтобы
> он окончательно не упал с каталки. В общем, мне показалось, что я попала в
> какое-то жуткое чистилище, которое было специально организовано так, чтобы
> еще живые люди в ужасе убегали из этого места.

While I was waiting [in line – GVO], I looked around and my eyes were wide
open in surprise. First of all, people who were brought to the hospital in
ambulances crawled out of the ambulances and walked to the reception window by
themselves (by the way, not a short distance). Sometimes the sick couldn't
walk by themselves and then nurses would run around the hospital yelling “We
need a cart!” and a woman would always answer “We don't have carts!” and it
would repeat several times. The ones lucky enough to get a cart were lying on
uncovered surface _[of the cart – GVO]_ and they were being undressed for
examination right in the corridor or in a room with open doors. That is why I
saw private parts of several people, although I wasn't planning on doing it,
while I waited in line. Aside from that, I saw how a cart with a man was being
wheeled and it would always hit corners with force and the man had to be put
back in the cart so he wouldn't fall down completely. In general, it seemed
that I happened to be in a creepy purgatory that was organized that way so
people who were still alive could run away from it with horror.

It took more than an hour for _dorinem_ to get registered at the reception
desk (and she was bleeding all this time). The hospital and doctors did not
cheer her up. The rooms were dirty, the doctors were unprofessional and rude
and the whole atmosphere seemed to work so even a healthy person felt sick
while being there. Here is the description of a medical exam:

> Там стоял тазик. И в тазике плавали какие-то кровяные сгустки. Извините, но
> из песни слов не выкинешь. Я в полном ступоре смотрела на это. Потом
> повернулась к врачу и сказала дрожащим голосом: «Там… Там, в тазике, это…».
> Она подошла, посмотрела и сказала: «А, ну не обращайте внимания. Просто не
> садитесь на тазик, а вот тут, повыше». Я настолько обалдела от всего
> происходящего, что не нашлась, что сказать и все же полезла на кресло.

There was a basin. And there were some blood clots in the basin. I am sorry
but that is how it was. I was looking at it in full shock. And then I turned
to the doctor and said in a trembling voice: “There… There, in the basin,
something…” She came and look at and then said: “Don't pay attention to it.
Just don't sit on the basin but a little higher.” I was so shocked I did not
know what to say and I crawled on the gynecological chair.”

Not able to determine what was wrong with the woman, the doctors put _dorinem_
in a hospital room with other people. The hospital did not have hot water and
the patients would use plastic bottles to heat the water in the sun. The
hospital also did not have towels and toilet paper. Doctors and even nurses
were impossible to find during the weekend. Nothing worked and nobody wanted
to do anything about it. One had to be lucky to get blood tests done and
ultrasound exam was done only one day after.

The description of shocking moments experienced by _dorinem_ in the hospital
took seven long blog posts full of depressing pictures ([part

2](http://dorinem.livejournal.com/94260.html#cutid1),[ part

6](http://dorinem.livejournal.com/95784.html) and [part
7](http://dorinem.livejournal.com/96177.html)).

But _dorinem_ ‘s story has a happy end. She managed to fly back to Israel
alive and in a good spirit. Her blog posts now end with a wish to all readers
“Don't get sick. Anywhere.”

The blogger _dorinem_ was not the only computer-versed person who ever got
sick in a Russian hospital. But she was the one who expressed her outrage in
her blog and, provided that those posts were written in Russian, received
enormous publicity among other bloggers and, later, with media.

[“Israeli citizen on Russian Hospitals: ‘It's Purgatory that People Run
From'”](http://vrn.kp.ru/daily/24545/723244/) [RUS] reads a headline in one of
the most popular Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. [“Voronezh
Authorities Check Information of Israeli Citizen About Violations in Health
Care”](http://www.regnum.ru/news/society/1319439.html) informs another
headline of Russian information agency REGNUM. [“Can Voronezh Health Care be
Healed?” ](http://vrn.kp.ru/daily/24547.4/725018/)follows up with an article
Komsomolskaya Pravda.

The attention of media and authorities toward that particular hospital and
toward the state of health care in Russia was sudden and motivated by the blog
post. The example showed the growing influence of the Russian blogosphere when
it became common for media – and sometimes for the authorities – to react to
the reports written by bloggers.

The story is far from being over. The hospital in question is being
investigated and evaluated by different government commissions. But one thing
is for sure, as hard as it was for _dorinem_ to be in the Russian hospital,
her decision to blog about her experiences made a difference in Voronezh and
motivated other people in Russia to look at their lives through the eyes of a
foreigner.
