A short documentary on the Macedonian graffiti scene in the context of the
state-sponsored art/construction boom, made by two female scientists and
bloggers–[Vasilka Dimitrovska](https://twitter.com/#!/arheoblog) and [Ilina
Jakimovska](https://twitter.com/#!/ilinajakimovska)–has been shown at the
renowned archeological conference [Buffalo TAG
2012](http://www.cas.buffalo.edu/tag2012/).

Entitled [“Lions, Warriors and Graffiti Artists: Counter-Culture in Times of
Revived Antiquity”](http://youtu.be/OaP4uslEiEo), the documentary
[juxtaposes](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juxtapose) (an important visual
arts theory word!) information about the vigorous efforts of the government to
impose new, polished classicist/baroque visual identity on the center of the
Macedonian capital through the [Skopje 2014
project](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/06/macedonia-online-rebellion-
against-skopje-2014-plan/) (which features [bronze
lions](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/08/macedonia-bronze-lions-
accountability-transparency/)), with interviews of people from the graffiti
scene.

A co-author, archeologist Dimitrovska, [wrote

artists-counter-culture-in-times-of-revived-antiquity/) [mk] on her blog,
injecting a disclaimer often heard by people who dare to speak in public in
Macedonia:

> We made this documentary… in order to document with love part of the
> graffiti which disappeared or are about to disappear due to the new urban
> concepts implemented in our country, primarily in Skopje. The project has no
> political dimension, nor did we intend it to have any political connotation.
> This small project on Macedonian graffiti was made with modest finances, and
> we intended to present–without any censorship or montage of statements–the
> voices and opinions of the graffiti artists who shaped or are still shaping
> the visual part of this subculture, which is punishable by the laws but is
> also used (not abused) by the political class in power.

In the film, the interviewed artists also feel the need to decline any
interest in political life. They talk about being torn between the threat of
punishment if caught “writing” on their own (EUR 50 at least), and becoming a
sell-out for commercial reasons or in local government projects, which
sometimes involve co-opting graffiti artists to legally adorn specified public
buildings. They also mention a quickly forming generation gap within the
subculture.

The other co-author, ethnologist Jakimovska [wrote
this](http://etno.blog.com.mk/node/114554) [mk] on her blog in 2007, in a post
referencing the [famous scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lru4dJ4J6g)
from the film [Life of
Brian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian):

> It might sound incredible, but the graffiti are – folklore! Regardless of
> whether they convey messages through drawing or text, the graffiti, for
> those who make them and those who read them on city walls, are a form of
> expression and communication. If you have something hidden deep inside you,
> something that aches and burns you, write it on the wall, and it will speak
> it… Some of my favorites from Skopje include “A woman is not a woman unless
> she's a woman,” “Thank God I'm an atheist”…

on the public internet, but sometimes publish photos of their work within
Facebook.
