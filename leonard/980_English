about the issue of Violence Against Women are taking place across the region.
Many of these efforts are attracting the interest and participation of

In Guatemala, the Multi-Annual Campaign (extended from 2008 to 2015) of the
Regional Chapter, “JOIN together to put an End to Violence against Women” was
recently launched, and _Radio Feminista_ is reporting on the event at the
collaborative space [Fin a la Violencia (End to
Violence).](http://www.finalaviolencia.radiofeminista.org/) In addition, the
organization Take Back the Tech is promoting [a 16-day blogathon
](http://www.takebackthetech.net/take-action/16days)by taking over the
blogosphere to discuss topics related to violence against women and ways to
prevent it through the use of technology. Anyone [can join the
network](http://www.takebackthetech.net/write/blog-with-us) and blog about the
subject, from any place, in any language.

**Honduras**

When a crisis arises across the world, it often leaves women more vulnerable
as a target for violence. For example, the blog [_Género con Clase
[es]_](http://generoconclase.blogspot.com/2009/11/honduras-mas-feminicidio-y-
violencia.html) from Honduras republishes an article written by Tacuazina
Morales, who writes that there was an increase of violence and brutality
against women just after the coup. This was due in part to the “state of non-
protection that victims found themselves and the weakening of the institutions
responsible for the protection of the human rights of the women.” According to
Feministas en Resistencia, [ there were approximately 400 cases of violence
against women ](http://generoconclase.blogspot.com/2009/11/honduras-mas-
feminicidio-y-violencia.html) during the demostrations against the coup,
including 23 sexual assaults, some of which had the involvement of state
security forces.

**Guatemala**

In neighboring Guatemala, impunity, which is the non-prosecution or punishment
of perpetrators, is the most serious consequence of this phenomenon. Up to
[97% of the cases of violence against Guatemalan women are not
prosecuted](http://generoconclase.blogspot.com/2009/11/poca-respuesta-de-
guatemala-violencia.html) according to the blog Género con Clase [es].
Journalist Montserrat Boix features several organizations working on the issue
in the country, and [also highlights the recent Law Against Femicide passed in
2009 [es]](http://montserratboix.nireblog.com/post/2009/05/23/guatemala-mujer-
violencia-e-impunidad).

Guatemalan blogger Ixmucane of _Cine Sobre Todo [es]_[ writes about migrant
women, who are especially vulnerable to
violence](http://cinesobretodo.blogspot.com/2009/11/dia-internacional-contra-
la-violencia.html):

> Unas de las situaciones en las que las mujeres están más indefensas es en la
> migración, porque están lejos del círculo familiar que las proteje, no
> conocen las leyes y muchas veces tampoco el idioma. Insisto que cuando hablo
> de migración, hablo de la migración dentro del país como hacia el
> extranjero. Y lo peor es que no se quiere defraudar a la familia que se
> queda, ya que ellos dependen muchas veces económicamente de ellas.

One of the situations in which women are the most defenseless is migration,
because they are far from the family circle that protects them, they do not
know the laws, and many times they do not know the language. When I write
about migration, I mean migration within the country, as well as abroad. What
even worse, is that they do not want to let down the family that were left
behind, because many of the family members depend economically on the women.

In the [Catholic Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church
"Catholic Church"), a novena is a
[devotion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devotion "Devotion") consisting of
[prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer "Prayer") typically said on nine
successive days, asking to obtain special graces, so Julio Serrano of the blog
[_Fellinada [es]_](http://julitoserrano.blogspot.com/2009/11/dia-i.html) wrote
a series of nine articles or “a novena” to unveil the complexities of violence
against women. He also asks for the grace to replace violence with words of
love: he used as his prayers, nine real stories of different kinds of violence
against women and he ends with these thoughts:

> Finalmente, no es un golpe bajo hablar del amor en este día, es una postura
> radical, política, amar es un acto social. Desde mi masculinidad y
> reivindicando a la mujer en mí, y a la mujer en el otro, y a las mujeres
> cercanas y lejanas, a mi mamá, a mi novia, a mis amigas, a mis hermanos, a
> mi papá, a mis amigos, y a aquellas tres hermanas y a lo que representan
> para nosotros hoy, para ustedes estas palabras llenas de amor”

Finally, it is not a low blow to talk about love these days, it is a radical
and political position, to love is a social act. From my masculinity and
vindicating the woman in me and the woman in others, and to those women close
and far away from me, my mother, my girlfriend, my friends, my brothers, my
father, my friends, and for those three sisters and what they mean for us
today, for all of you, my words full of love”

Rudy Girón of the blog [_Antigua Daily
Photo_](http://antiguadailyphoto.com/2009/11/17/stop-violence-against-women/)
made a statement about why we should reject violence as something normal, and
why we should take that as a starting point to be part of the solution to
solve the problem of violence against women:

> I do not want to hear gun shots as normal. I refuse to take violent acts as
> normal. I do not want to be desensitized towards all the manifestations of
> violence. I do not want to see [naked guns on the
> streets](http://antiguadailyphoto.com/2006/12/29/the-naked-gun/); at the
> entrance of banks; with every delivery truck; at shops and every tiendita
> (store) in the country. I do not want to be part of the problem. I will not
> yield to words that belittle women or other people. I will not. I want to be
> part of the solution.

The world has changed again, bringing more complex problems to the forefront
to be solved, but because of the internet there are also more voices to join
the conversation who add their ideas for solutions. Even the most marginalized
in society, poor, indigenous women are fighting for their rights as [described
by the blog of Guatemala
Solidarity](http://www.guatemalasolidarity.org.uk/?q=blog) so it is time to
say no to violence and say yes to a more equal society.
