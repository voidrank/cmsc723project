Seven days have passed since Bahrain's Day of Wrath protests which started on
February 14, causing the death of eight protesters in the capital Manama.
While protesters continue to camp in Pearl (Lulu) Roundabout, two rallies, one
in support of the protests and another in support of the royal family are
taking place as I type.

After the country's Crown Prince called for calm and dialogue, anti government
or pro-democracy protesters have enjoyed peaceful protests at Lulu Roundabout
since Saturday. This call also has encouraged what many have called the
“silent majority” to speak up and show their support to the royal family, led
by prominent Islamic scholar Shaikh Abdullatif Al-Mahmood.

Tonight two rallies set out at the same time, 7pm local time, starting at two
locations in the capital Manama. The first being a student rally starting from
~~Dana Mall, within sight of the Lulu Roundabout~~ from Al-Qufool intersection
near Salmaniya Hospital to the Lulu Roundabout.

The second rally will be at Al-Fateh mosque, which also held a pro government
pro King rally last Friday. Many #silentmajority tweeps headed to the rally a
few hours beforehand and explained the reason for the rally:

Some rumours were flying across Bahrain's network on social media sites and
Blackberry Broadcasts of the need to show the rally's participants Smart Card
and ID to the organisers. This was however quashed by “[14th February | Our

Some tweeps not happy with the seemingly growing divide between Bahrain's
people, started using the hashtag #UniteBH and have called for both rallies to
meet at Lulu Roundabout or Al-Fateh.

> Dear Lulu crowd, why don't u walk 2 alfate7 & exchange flowers with ur

> @[hhusaini](http://twitter.com/#!/hhusaini/status/39714160405254144)
> @moalkhalifa Dear marchers at fatah #bahrain, you want unity? Peace? Take a
> rose and go to #lulu and share a moment of silence for the dead.

Tweep Ehsan Al-Kooheji calls for both rallies to meet halfway and acknowledge
each other.

> @[ehsankooheji](http://twitter.com/#!/ehsankooheji/status/39712747943886848)
> Dear #Lulu AND #Fateh, why dont you BOTH start marching to meet each other
> halfway to shake hands & stop pretending other side doesnt exist.

In reply to @hhusaini, Tweep Mohamed Al-Khalifa answered:

> @hhusaini I will :)
