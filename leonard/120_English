**Update (June 9, 2011): Since this post was published questions have been
raised about the true identity of “Amina Arraf”. The photo below proved to be
of a Croatian woman who lives in London. Read
more[here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/06/09/syria-true-identity-of-
arrested-blogger-questioned/).**

Amina Arraf has seen a quick rise to fame.
[Blogging](http://damascusgaygirl.blogspot.com/) pseudonymously, as Amina
Abdullah, she writes about politics, the recent uprising, and being a lesbian
in Syria. A dual citizen of the United States and Syria, her powerful words
have shown the reality on the ground in Syria over the past few weeks.

Today, on Amina's own blog, it was reported that she had been kidnapped by
authorities. Her cousin, Rania O. Ismail,
[reported](http://damascusgaygirl.blogspot.com/2011/06/amina.html):

> Earlier today, at approximately 6:00 pm Damascus time, Amina was walking in
> the area of the Abbasid bus station, near Fares al Khouri Street. She had
> gone to meet a person involved with the Local Coordinating Committee and was
> accompanied by a friend.

A few hours after the first post, Amina's cousin [updated
it](http://damascusgaygirl.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-amina.html) with
news:

> I have been on the telephone with both her parents and all that we can say
> right now is that she is missing. Her father is desperately trying to find
> out where she is and who has taken her.
>
> Unfortunately, there are at least 18 different police formations in Syria as
> well as multiple different party militias and gangs. We do not know who took
> her so we do not know who to ask to get her back. It is possible that they
> are forcibly deporting her.
>
> From other family members who have been imprisoned there, we believe that
> she is likely to be released fairly soon. If they wanted to kill her, they
> would have done so.
>
> That is what we are all praying for.

Amina's rise to fame was
[profiled](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/06/gay-girl-damascus-
syria-blog) in _The Guardian_ just a few weeks ago, in an article which called
her an “unlikely hero of revolt in a conservative country”.

On Twitter, Amina's friends and supporters are tweeting in solidarity, using
the hashtag [#FreeAmina](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23FreeAmina), and a
[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-Amina-Abdalla-Syrian-
Blogger/135381776536851) has been created to urge global citizens to contact
their local US Embassies, as well as journalists and other public figures.
