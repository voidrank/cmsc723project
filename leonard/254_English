Tunisian bloggers are outraged over the sacking of Interim Interior Minister
Farhat Rajhi today. In a surprise move, he was replaced by Hbib El-Seed.

During the protests that had swept the country from mid December last year,
demonstrators chanted “The Interior Ministry is a terrorist ministry.” When
Rajhi was named Interior Minister, contempt towards the ministry started to
ease. Indeed, during the two months he was acting as the Interior Minister, he
managed to gain back the trust of the people with his transparency, his
efforts to respond to the demands of the people and his humorous character.

In his first days in office, Rajhi fired 45 corrupt high-level officials. He
also responded to two key popular demands – the dissolution of both the RCD,
the former ruling party associated with repression and corruption, and the
Secret Police. He then helped bring order and stability after the state of
anarchy Tunisia was thrown in following the ouster of former Tunisian
president Zeine Al Abedine Ben Ali. Despite Rajhi's achievements popularity as
an Interior minister, it remains unclear why he was dismissed.

**Bloggers Praising Farhat Rajhi:**

Bloggers received the news with shock and confusion as the mystery of why
Farhat Rajhi was dismissed continues.  
Nizar Toumi was very mad at the interim Prime Minister Beji Caed Sebsi for
taking the decision to dismiss Rajhi. He

فرحات الرّاجحي قد أخذ على عاتقه تلبية مطالب الشّعب التّونسي تناغما مع ثورته
المجيدة و اتّخذ خطوات عمليّة في وزارته متحمّلا مسؤوليته في إدارة هذه الوزارة
فقام بالتنسيق مع رئاسة أركان الجيش بالقبض على بعض رموز الفساد و إقالة بعض
قيادات الأجهزة الأمنية و أصدر تعليماته للأمن بعدم الاعتداء على المواطنين ، و
حظر عمل التّجمّع نهائيّا و تقدّم بقضيّة في حلّه و مصادرة ممتلكاته ، و حلّ
البوليس السّياس ه

Farhat Rajhi's heavy burden was to meet the demands of the people, in response
to their glorious revolution. He took practical steps and he was responsible
in managing the affairs of his ministry and coordinated with the Chief of Army
Staff to arrest some of the symbols of corruption, dismissing a number of the
security services’ high officials, and ordering the security forces not to
assault citizens. He also banned all activities of the RCD (the former ruling
party), presented a case to the court to dissolve the RCD and froze all of its
properties, and brought an end to the Secret Police (…)

He adds:

> و لمّا جاء “هيبة الدّولة” منعه من المبادرة و من الاتّصال بوسائل الإعلام
> بدعوى أنّ النّاطق باسم الحكومة هو الوحيد المخوّل له الإدلاء بالتّصريحات ، و
> منع من اتّخاذ أيّ قرار منفردا و وقع إلزامه فقط بتطبيق قرارات الحكومة “هيبة
> الدّولة” ، ثمّ طُلب منه القبض على ناشطي الفيس بوك … و لم يفعل … فوقعت إقالته
> ، فرحات الرّاجحي كان بمثابة الجلد بالنّسبة للجسد ، الحاجز الأوّل لحمايته من
> الجراثيم

And when the “State's Prestige” became Prime Minister ( In his first press
conference, PM Beji Caed Sebsi said that among his priorities is to bring back
to the Tunisian state its “prestige”), he banned Farhat Rajhi from contacting
the media using the pretext that issuing public statements lies in the hands
of the spokesman of the government. He was also prohibited from taking
individual decisions, and he was only obliged to carry out the decisions taken
by the government of “the State's prestige”. Then, he was asked to arrest
Facebook activists…but he refused… so he was sacked. Rajhi was like the skin
of the body; the first barrier that protects it from bacteria.

Merkhi Souhail [ says:](http://unseulr.blogspot.com/2011/03/qui-est-parti-
avec-rajhi.html)

> Je croyais que le président provisoire n'avait pas le pouvoir de limoger un

I thought the interim president does not have the power to sack a minister.
This is what I have read in the articles of our constitution

He adds:

> Le profane que je suis ne peut trouver de bonnes raisons pour démettre cet
> homme simple de discours et qui avait démontré une efficacité jamais vue
> dans notre gouvernance. Ces deux qualité lui ont valu un grand respect et
> une popularité qui ferait mourirde jalousie nos politiciens en paille .

With the little knowledge that I have, I can't find good reasons to sack this
man who has shown simplicity in communicating with the public, and has
demonstrated an efficiency never seen before in our governance. These two
qualities have brought him respect and popularity that would make our
politicians green with envy
