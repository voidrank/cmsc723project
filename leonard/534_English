If a dead fetus is discovered, it usually generates a strong condemnation
especially from the conservative circles. But what should be the proper
reaction if [2,000 dead
fetuses](http://www.thaiphotoblogs.com/index.php?blog=5&title=2000-fetuses-
found-at-thai-buddhist-temp&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) are found in a Buddhist
Temple?

Everybody in Thailand is still recovering from the emotional effect produced
by a shocking report about the discovery of 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses in
the temple of Wat Phai Ngern. This has reinvigorated the debate on whether it
is already time to update the country’s abortion laws.

Abortion is illegal in Thailand except under certain conditions. Abortion is
permitted if a woman is raped, if the pregnancy affects her health or if the
fetus is abnormal. It is estimated that around
[150,000-200,000](http://twitter.com/thai_intel/statuses/5826928879603712)
women per year are going to private clinics for illegal abortion.

The country’s Prime Minister believes abortion laws are already adequate. What
he suggests is further [re-

youth. Twitter user tulsathit reacts to this statement

The dead fetus horror has prompted a
[lawmaker](http://61.47.61.3/cfcustom/cache_page/132840.html) to propose the
legalization of abortion. But his aim, which is to reduce the country’s “low
quality” population, surprised _[Bangkok
