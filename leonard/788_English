If you thought that wearing fur was outdated – what with all those green
movements and animal rights activists who put this cruel sense of fashion in
its right place with the likes of [Cruella de
Vil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruella_de_Vil) – fashionista's say, think
again.

Last month the fashion world went literally “wild” in [New York, Paris and
Milan](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/fashion/11FUR.html?scp=3&sq=fur%20fashion%202010&st=cse)
during the unveiling of their fall collection. They had models strutting the
catwalk in so much fur, it was scary enough to make animal rights activists
and environmentalists jump out of _their_ skins.

In this era of global warming and dwindling animal species, one would think
that we humans would come to our senses and rethink our actions. Not so, it
seems, as there is a whole other world out there – the fashion industry of the
west – whose endorsement and use of [fur and exotic animal
products](http://fashion-allure.com/style/fur-fashion-fall-2009-winter-2010/)
simply encourages the mass slaughter of many endangered species.

To name a few, the [Chiru or Tibetan
antelope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbFpGM4a7q0), whose underbelly fur is
used to make [“Shatoosh](http://shahtoosh.info/)” the world's most expensive
shawls, also known as “shawls of death”. It takes 3 dead antelopes, to make
one shawl, so fine it can fit through a finger ring, and each one can cost
between [$5000 to $20,000 in the international
market](http://www.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/tibetan_antelope/).
Even babies, and mother's who have just delivered, are not spared.

According to
[WWF,](http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/globalmarkets/wildlifetrade/buyersbeware-
antelope.html) the population of this species has declined by over 50 percent
in the last 20 years and the [Tibetan Plateau
Project](https://www.earthislandprojects.org/tpp/antelope.htm) says that it
was the fashion-driven demand for Shatoosh in the U.S that resulted in as many
as 20,000 antelopes being slaughtered. It is alarming to know that the animal
could become extinct in the next three years at this rate.

In a blog run by [_Uma and Hurree_ called Animal Rights
India](http://animalrightsindia.blogspot.com/2005/09/saving-shahtoosh-not-
chiru_16.html), they argue how farming of Chiru's – like Eider ducks in
Iceland for eider, will not make a difference to the dwindling numbers.

> But hello: Eider ducks are now a protected species, and farmers in iceland
> use a technique of collecting the down without harming the bird. And no, it
> is not possible to obtain the shahtoosh wool without killing the chiru.

They go on to say:

> It's impossible to justify killing three beautiful wild animals every time
> you want to push a length of shawl through a ring, blah blah. And to farm
> them just to kill them for shawls?

[_Raja Basu_ , another blogger](http://rajabasu.blogspot.com/2009/02/cost-of-
one-shahtoosh-shawl-at-least.html) said:

> The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
> and Flora (CITES) – which controls the trade in endangered species products
> – has completely banned international trade in Tibetan antelope products
> (including Shahtoosh). It is illegal to import Shahtoosh into many

> not enough to have laws. There must also be a strong public protest across
> the board against every person who is by any means related to the Shahtoosh
> trade. There should be a widespread public sensitization campaign to educate
> the common people.

Bloggers in the west, however, were giving this some thought and debated:

[_Rachel Menashy_](http://rachelmenashy.blogspot.com/2010/01/fur-acceptable-
or-not.html) wrote on her blog:

But there is a difference as Barry Williams responded to a thread: _Wearing
Fur is not immoral_ on
[www.helium.com](http://www.helium.com/items/803881-wearing-fur-is-not-
immoral)

There are a multitude of arguments out there, but in the meantime the [Humane
Society for the United
States](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2010/03/canadian_govt_increases_seal_quota_031510.html),
says that Canada will slaughter 388, 200 harp, grey and hooded seals this
year, an increase of 50,000 from 2009. This, because of the overall demand for
fur. The site of the Fur Council of Canada shows styles and celebrities
modelling various furs in what it describes as a fashion trend of 2010.

And unfortunately in the U.S, and much of the west where Global Fashion trends
are set, laws don't seem to be enough to curb their greed. According to the
[International Fur Trade Federation Blog](http://iftfblog.com/):

> ..the shift in the attitude towards fur can be attributed to “changes within
> the fur trade, such as the introduction of the new Origin Assured
> initiative, which guarantees that fur bearing the label comes from a country
> with animal welfare regulations”. This shows that the fur trade efforts and
> initiatives to challenge the outdated ideas of our industry have been
> noticed. We are a transparent and well-regulated industry that supports high
> animal welfare standards and we welcome the confidence and support shown by
> the fashion designers as well as the European Commission, who recently
> recognised the importance of the Origin Assured label.

Fashion designers who have been courted by Furriers [say they are
“confident](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/fashion/11FUR.html?scp=3&sq=fur%20and%20fashion&st=cse)
using fur after examining the chain of production and finding it humane.” But
could this confidence be based on a lack of investigation or knowledge?
[According to an endangered species handbook
:](http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/trade_tibetan.php)

> The New York luxury department store, Bergdorf Goodman, advertised shahtoosh
> in 1995 as a “royal and rare” fabric, making incorrect statements about the
> wool having been obtained from the Mountain Ibex goat of Tibet which “sheds
> its down undercoat by scratching itself against low trees and bushes” from
> where it is gathered by local shepherds (Schaller 1998)

And if the [clubbing of baby seals](http://www.canadasshame.com/) and mass
slaughtering of [Chiras, mothers and
babies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4egbGRIZg&feature=related), is
“humane” then its sad to think of what “humane” means anymore, and what we are
willing to condone in the name of “Fashion”.
