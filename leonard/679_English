Even before Barack Obama sacked General McCrystal, Australia bloggers were
questioning the commitment of troops to the Afghanistan war. This has
intensified with the deaths of five soldiers in the last couple of weeks.

The policy has the support of the main parties except for the Greens.

Leo Shanahan at the _Punch_ , a News Limited blog site, analysed the
bipartisan support and seemed to endorse it:

> in the case of the war in Afghanistan both are of the genuine majority
> belief that it’s the right thing to do. The (well founded) fear is that to
> leave Afghanistan now would be effectively leaving it to the Taliban and
> their support of extremism and terrorism in the region and in the west.

Bernard Keane at _Crikey_ used opinion polling as one of the arguments for
withdrawal:

> Most Australians want us out of the Afghanistan conflict.
>
> It doesn’t matter how old they are, how they vote, or how much they earn.
> That’s what Essential Research found in the course of its polling last week.
>
> Support for increasing our commitment (the Coalition’s policy) was in single
> digits. Support for keeping it at the same level was around a quarter of
> voters. Support for withdrawal was over 60%.

There has been concern that it is unpatriotic and undermining of the our
soldiers to attack our involvement in the context of the deaths.

Blogger _politicalowl_ explored this:

> No one it seems wants to appear disloyal to the troops putting their lives

> Brown who are prepared to say we should not be there at all are in short

Pip Hinman of the _GreenLeft_ Weekly blog took a hardline anti-war position:

> It is a tragedy that three more Australian soldiers have been killed in this
> near-decade long war but it is ordinary civilians in Afghanistan and
> Pakistan who have been the biggest victims in this war.
>
> The misnamed “war on terror” is better described as a war of terror against
> ordinary, poor folk in Afghanistan and currently serves to prop up the
> corrupt and despotic puppet regime of Hamid Karzai.  
>  [New poll: Majority want troops out of
> Afghanistan](http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/44516)

At _Public Opinion_ Gary Sauer-Thompson’s opposition was less strident but
made similar objections:

> …what the politicians say about the constant progress (painting a rosy-
> picture) often bears little resemblance to what happens on the ground in
> Afghanistan.
> http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/06/15/helmand_anatomy_of_a_disaster
>
> The core justification for Australia's involvement in this war is the
> Taliban providing a safe haven for terrorists, Al Qa’ida and the threat of a
> sanctuary and base for international terrorism, and the fact the conflict
> now involves Pakistan’s future stability.
>
> This justification barely stands up as no terrorist groups threaten
> Australia and al-Qaeda is now largely in Pakistan.

John Passant at _En Passant_ , an active member of the Socialist Alliance,
drew the inevitable comparisons with the Vietnam war:

> Everything you hear from our leaders about Afghanistan is a Vietnam lie. We
> are not winning. We are not bringing democracy, or liberating women or
> fighting terrorism.
>
> Australia is in Afghanistan to support the United States, our imperialist
> protector.

Even with the sudden [change of Prime
Minister](http://larvatusprodeo.net/2010/06/24/julia-gillard-is-prime-
minister-wayne-swan-dpm/) in Australia, the commitment is unlikely to change.
The withdrawal strategy and timetable may be the main focus of any debate at
the election due this year.
