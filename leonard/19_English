Ecuador's [Villonaco wind farm
project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34MO8BaJvVQ), located in the province
of Loja, is considered emblematic of the government of President Rafael Correa
Delgado, himself a former economist. Morevoer, it is the world's highest such
eolian structure, built some 2,720 metres above sea level.

On Wednesday January 2, 2013, President Correa refused to officially open the
Villonaco wind farm, branding it incomplete because [it does not have an
access road](http://www.eluniverso.com/2013/01/02/1/1355/correa-inauguro-
proyecto-eolico-villonaco-encontrarlo-inconcluso.html).

> Para este presidente, acabar el proyecto, es tener una vía decente. Incluso
> es una falta de respeto llevar al presidente por una vía llena de baches,
> por eso el día de hoy no inauguré el proyecto Villonaco, lo cual me ha dado
> mucho dolor.

> For this president, a finished project is one with adequate access. What's
> more it shows a lack of respect to have the president driven over a road
> full of pot holes. It pains to me to say it, but this is why I did not

The wind farm is made up of 11 generators with a total output capacity of 16.5
MW, a substation to step up power from 34.5 to 69 kilovolts, and a
subtransmission line that links the Villonaco substation to its counterpart in
Loja, which is on Ecuador's national power grid.

The system was set up by the Chinese company Xinjian Goldwind Science and
Technology and will cut CO2 emissions by as much as 35.270 metric tons a year.
It will also reduce diesel imports, the fuel needed to generate thermal
electricity. As Correa points out on Ecuador's [Ministry of Tourism
website](http://www.turismo.gob.ec/parque-eolico-villonaco-proyecto-innovador-
a-escala-mundial/), “We would save almost USD 13 million per year in fuel
costs alone.”

Ecuador's electrical company CELEC is in charge of the infrastructure, with an
investment of USD 36 million. The benefits are myriad, especially in terms of
the environment insofar as the project will reduce toxic emissions in the
atmosphere; in economic terms, it will satisfy 25% of the annual energy
consumption of the province of Loja. The project will also cover 68,7% of the
demand currently handled by the Empresea Eléctrica Regional Sur, the company
that provides power to the provinces of Loja, Zamora, and sections of Morona
Santiago.

An additional advantage is that it will generate some 90% of local jobs,
direct and indirect employment of 257 and 760 posts respectively. It also
promises to be an important tourist attraction, with an information centre
open to locals and visitors from farther afield.

During his January 2 visit to Loja, however, the president declined the
opportunity to inaugurate, among other projects, the Villonaco wind farm,
characterising it as incomplete because of [the poor state of its access
roads](http://www.eluniverso.com/2013/01/02/1/1355/correa-inauguro-proyecto-
eolico-villonaco-encontrarlo-inconcluso.html).

> Me negué a inaugurar el proyecto eólico, porque no somos mediocres. No se
> hizo lo principal, una vía decente de entrada.

> I refuse to inaugurate the wind farm project because we are not mediocre. We
> did not provide the cornerstone: a decent means of entry.

In response to this, a number of residents of Loja commented on Twitter.

In the end the provincial government of Loja (GPL) was tasked with improving
the access road.
