In the English language it means “Honest, Fair, Firm.” These were the words
written in red paint by veteran movie actor [Pong
Harjatmo](http://www.indonesiafirst.com/2010/07/8489/profil-pong-hardjatmo/)
on the roof of the parliament building of Indonesia as a sign of protest
against what he described as inefficient democratic and legislative system of
the country.

A few days before the 68-year old actor
[climbed](http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/nasional/2010/07/30/brk,20100730-267662,uk.html)
the 100-meter-tall parliament building, a report was published which exposed
the declining attendance record of members of the House of Representatives.
This explains why many netizens are somewhat sympathetic to the intentions and
actions of Pong.

_Multibrand_ hopes the lazy members of Congress would realize that many people
in Indonesia are already [“sick and
tired”](http://multibrand.blogspot.com/2010/07/pong-harjatmo-and-
parliament.html) about their poor performance

_sounds of gibberish_ notes that Pong showed the [young
people](http://rouju.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/do-it-with-style-just-
don%E2%80%99t-forget-the-substance/) how to effectively protest instead of
ranting on Twitter and Facebook

Some members of Congress and security officers recognize the right of Pong to
air his opinion but reminded the actor to express it “politely” and not
through acts of vandalism. Pong was not charged in the courts but he was
advised not to repeat the protest stunt.
