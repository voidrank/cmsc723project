When the called “Arab revolts” exploded, some wondered if the same was
[possible in Sub-Saharan
Africa](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/03/africa-will-there-be-
jasmine-revolution-in-sub-saharan-africa/). These winds of freedom spread
along the demonstrations and through one fundamental tool: the Internet. Blogs
and twitter accounts were used not only to pass information or call upon
people to struggle for rights, but also as platforms to share thoughts and
demands of freedom.

Egypt has about 200,000 blogs and 5 million Facebook users. This is very
different from Equatorial Guinea, where only 2% of the population has access
to the Internet, and there are about 11,000 Facebook users and two blogs. Two
known blogs.

Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel ( _[Malabo](http://www.fronterad.com/?q=blog/18)
_[es]) and Eyi Nguema ( _[Opinión desde Guinea
Ecuatorial](http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/eyi-nguema/posts) _[es]) are the
only bloggers writing in Equatorial Guinea. But their blogs are hosted in
Spain, the first one on the digital magazine _[Frontera
D](http://www.fronterad.com/) _[es] and the second in the newspaper _[El
País](http://www.elpais.com/global/) _[es].

The comparison with the Egyptian situation on this subject isn’t haphazard. On
February 11, 2011, while hundreds of people were at the Tahrir Square and
Hosni Mubarak announced his withdrawal, the president of the Spanish Congress
of Deputies, José Bono, was visiting Equatorial Guinea, making famous the
sentence “it is much more that unites us than what separates us.” And he
wasn’t talking about the Equatoguinean people, but the dictator Teodoro Obiang
Nguema, in power since 1979.

On the same February 11, Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel started a hunger strike, to
protest against the “dictatorship that eats our souls” and against the Spanish
support of Obiang. In his [last post](http://www.fronterad.com/?q=node/2787)
[es] before the hunger strike, Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel wrote about the
dictator Obiang and his presidency of the African Union. He criticized
building roads and houses for institutional events, while the Equatoguineans
have to confront the lack of basic social infrastructure and the destruction
of their homes when they are in “strategic” places:

> En Malabo, y en las inmediaciones del poblado de Baney, pero cerca de la
> costa, han arrasado un terreno muy grande para construir los hoteles, los
> establecimientos de lujo y las residencias particulares de los presidentes
> africanos para cuando se reunirán para celebrar la cumbre anual este año.

In Malabo, in the vicinity of Baney village, near the shore, they have
destroyed a lot of land to build the hotels, the luxury establishments and the
private residencies of the African presidents during the annual summit this
year.

In his blog _[Opinión desde Guinea
Ecuatorial](http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/eyi-nguema/posts) _[es], Eyi Nguema
also highlights the lack of governmental social and economical policies for
the population: how to live without electricity, how to manage the need of
water, how to make Equatorial Guinea a country with a place within the global
networks. And how to make a country for the nationals and not for foreign
interests or the political elite related to the clan Nguema.

> aquí los guineoecuatorianos no controlamos nada de eso; por lo que huelga
> meter el dedo en la llaga y exhortarnos a trabajar con la idea de que hemos
> de luchar por nuestra independencia

here the Equatoguineans don’t manage anything; that’s why we need to put the
finger in the wound and exhort to work the idea that we need to fight for our
independence

Along with their constant struggle for political autonomy, the quest for the
right to build their own houses is an everyday issue in Equatorial Guinea. In
his [most recent post](http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/eyi-
nguema/2011/1/29/-que-me-hipotequen-y-me-prohiban-construir-) [es], Eyi Nguema
writes about the houses in his country:

> En efecto, lo que sucede es que, para no vivir en la intemperie, se compra
> cuatro tablas y cuatro pies derechos de madera (o bloques de mortero de
> cemento y arena), más chapas de hojalata y se levanta un cobertizo; a un
> lado se excava el pozo para el agua que se va beber y a otro, el que
> albergará las aguas residuales (fecales incluidas) y listo. Aquí cuando se
> habla de viviendas, en un 80% o más, se habla de construcciones de este
> tipo.

As a matter of fact, if you don’t want to live in the open, you buy four
planks and four feet of wood (or blocks of cement and sand), tinplates and you
build a shed; on one side, you dig the potable water well, on the other, the
residual waters (including the fecal ones) well. And that’s it! Here, when we
talk about houses, 80% or more of the time we are talking about these kinds of
constructions.

These bloggers don’t hide the fact that Equatorial Guinea is a rich country.
There is plenty of oil, wood and water. But most of the population lives in
misery, with high rates of infant mortality and a paralysis in agriculture.
Human rights violations, such as political persecution and summary executions,
are rampant, as confirmed in the most recent [Human Rights
Report](http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154344.htm) of the
country.

Blogger Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel’s also writes about these issues. But in his
case, cyberactivism is a true commitment with the polis. This blogger and
famous writer often says he has a free mind and no intentions of entering
formal politics. But when he saw himself forced to leave Equatorial Guinea
after he began the hunger strike, he was already a political symbol. He
describes Equatorial Guinea as a “republican kingdom” or a “non republic,” and
with this in mind he wrote about nepotism and the confiscation of the state by
Obiang while he was in his country. Now he lives in Barcelona and writes about
the perils of the apathy of the national and the international communities,
and the absence of action because of fear. He argues that [one of the
arguments is](http://www.fronterad.com/?q=node/2926) [es]:

> Aquí estamos bien. Es África. Hay países peores que este. ¿No has oído la
> radio? __

Here we are ok. This is Africa. There are countries worse than this. Didn’t
you listen to the radio?

The national radio suffers severe [political
censorship](http://en.rsf.org/equatorial-guinea-in-wave-of-censorship-
authorities-04-03-2011,39678.html). People who listen to the Radio-Télévision
Nationale de Guinée Équatoriale don’t know what has happened in Tunisia, in
Egypt or Libya. In a country without newspapers, they can only depend on mouth
to mouth spreading of news. Or those who have access to the Internet can read
the [Asodegue](http://www.asodegue.org/) __ [es] page, the only website with
other information about Equatorial Guinea.

Under these extreme circumstances, the blogs of Eyi Nguema and Juan Tomás
Ávila Laurel offer two of the very few possibilities to build a virtual space
for free expression. _This is Africa_ , says Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel.
