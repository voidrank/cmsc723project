Riots in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, have led to the deaths of at least
[nine](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8250357.stm) people (BBC) as members
of the Baganda ethnic group clashed with police and military forces on
Thursday and Friday.  
  
The riots are an escalation of an ongoing feud between the central Ugandan
government and the King (or “Kabaka”) of the Baganda tribe, Ronald Muwenda
Mutebi II. The Baganda people belong to the [Kingdom of
Buganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buganda),* and they are the largest
Ugandan ethnic group.

Last week, Mutebi announced that he was planning an official visit to Kayunga,
a district about 45km (28 miles) northeast of Kampala. The district is part of
the Kingdom of Buganda, but it is also home to many members of the Banyala
ethnic group, many of whom would prefer to establish their own independent
kingdom.

Banyala leaders [announced](http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/regional-
special/Banyala_plan_to_demonstrate_against_Kabaka_s_visit_90642.shtml) they
would protest the visit and warned Mutebi not to come. The central government
responded by
[warning](http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/sun_news/Govt_warns_Kabaka_against_visiting_Kayunga_90866.shtml)
Mutebi to stay out of the district and
[arresting](http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Teargas_as_tension_builds_in_Kayunga_90982.shtml)
several Baganda people in the area who were erecting exhibition stalls and
tents in preparation for his arrival.
