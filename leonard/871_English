In the early morning hours of January 25, Paraguayan footballer [Salvador
Cabañas](http://www.clubamerica.com.mx/plantilla/047865/ficha-salvador-
cabanas.) was shot in the head during an altercation in a Mexico City bar
bathroom. The exact motive for the shooting is still unclear, but Mexican
police is currently looking for a suspect.

Cabañas, who plays for the Club América in the Mexican First Division, was out
with his wife when the incident occurred. After being rushed to the hospital,
he underwent surgery, but doctors were unable to remove the bullet. Cabañas
remains in critical conditions, but his condition is improving as he is
already [moving, eating, and speaking with
relatives](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6121B520100203?type=sportsNews).

Much of the media coverage has mentioned [Cabañas’ desire to return to the
playing field](http://www.skysports.com/football/world-
cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_5915026,00.html) for his club team and the
Paraguayan national team, which has qualified for the 2010 World Cup to be
played starting in June.

Paraguayan blogger Carlos Rodríguez of _Rescatar [es]_
[writes](http://rescatar.blogspot.com/2010/02/salvador-cabanas-apoyemos-al-
hombre-sin.html), “let's support the man before putting business first.” He
adds that there are too many people passing along sensationalist and
irresponsible information:

> Es una bendición la fortaleza del jugador que con una bala en el cerebro

> manejen el tema con sensatez. Es cierto, Cabañas vende. Vende camisetas,

It is a blessing to see the strength of a player with a bullet in his brain
react to the medical treatment, but it is important that the media handles the
subject with sensibleness. It is true, Cabañas sells. He sells jerseys, flags,
calendars, DVDs, sells covers, news. He is a successful product. However, it
is worth mentioning that we should make an effort and not exacerbate the
commercial side because Salvador's recovery advances more and more each day.

There are much speculation on the motive whether it was a robbery or a fight,
the dialogue between the two men, and the testimony provided by witnesses.
Blogger José Angel Lopez Barrios [writes

There are many loose ends…. evidently to date there is nothing clear about the
attack against Salvador Cabañas…and as the hours pass, it seems as if the
investigations tend to be focused on implausible situations.

However, with news of his improving status, Rodríguez also has questions
[about the situation in which Cabañas placed
himself](http://rescatar.blogspot.com/2010/01/lamentable-salvador-cabanas-
se.html).

What is a high-performance footballer doing at a party at 5:30 in the morning?
Above all, exposing himself to attacks like the one that left Salvador Cabañas
between life and death. Unfortunately, what he was doing was running an
unnecessary risk, at an hour that fatigue and consumption leaves one's
judgment weakened.

There have been signs of support for the footballer at the recent Club
América's match, [back in his native Paraguay
