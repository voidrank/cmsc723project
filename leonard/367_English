A teenager was [shot and killed in Aden,
Yemen](http://english.aljazeera.net//news/middleeast/2011/02/201122184349572801.html)
on Monday, February 21 as [tens of thousands of
demonstrators](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_YEMEN?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)
gathered in four separate cities on the 11th day of protests calling for the
end of the three-decade reign of [President Ali Abdullah
Saleh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh). At least [11 people
have died](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/yemen-
president-rejects-demands-he-step-down-now/article1915117/) since the
demonstrations began, and Amnesty International
[says](http://blog.amnestyusa.org/middle-east/more-violence-in-yemen/) at
least 78 people have been injured. Five students remain in police
[custody](http://almasdaronline.com/index.php?page=news&article-
section=1&news_id=15309).

In a press conference on Monday, President Saleh said he [refused to step
down](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/world/middleeast/22yemen.html?_r=1&ref=world),
but did offer to hold talks with opposition parties. This was [quickly
rejected](http://www.todayonline.com/World/EDC110222-0000180/Raising-stakes-
in-Bahrain,-Yemen). The protesters, younger citizens and opposition party
supporters, don't appear to be going anywhere soon. Students began [camping
out](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/yemen/110221/yemen-students-protests)
at Sana'a University on Sunday. And in Aden, police fired warning shots to
disperse protesters, who also said they would make a camp.

Al-Masdar Online has [photos from Monday's
rallies](http://almasdaronline.com/index.php?page=news&article-
section=1&news_id=15309).

Video photographers grabbed shots from all over the country.
