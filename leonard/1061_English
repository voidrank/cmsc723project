Machia Park is well-known to many foreigner travelers, who often visit the
animal refuge located near Villa Tunari in the Cochabamba Tropics in Central
Bolivia. Some of these travelers, even stay a bit longer as volunteers with
the organization [Inti Wara
Yassi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inti_Wara_Yassi), where they rehabilitate
monkeys that had once been kept as pets, as well as protect some of the other
wildlife located in the Park.

However, some of these volunteers are now leading the charge to protect Machia
Park, as there is a current roads project that cuts through the middle of the
Park. This new road is being built by the local municipality, so that it would
make it easier for coca-growers to transport their crop. The conflict
continues between the organization and local authorities, with critics of the
plan saying that [the project did not conduct the necessary Environmental
Impact study, and that arrangements were not made to accommodate the displaced
animals](http://www.intiwarayassi.org/articles/volunteer_animal_refuge/ciwy_noticias.html#136).

Some volunteers have been appealing directly through their blog at Inti Wara
Yassi, [describing what areas would be at
risk](http://www.intiwarayassi.org/articles/volunteer_animal_refuge/ciwy_noticias.html#136):

> The monkey park, where several species of monkey are cared for and fed –
> capuchins, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys.  
>  Areas where tortoices, agoutis, coatis are kept.  
>  The spider monkey park.  
>  The enclosures for three of our felines – Leoncio, Gato and Luna  
>  The “mirador” area, where abused and mistreated capuchin monkeys are
> rehabilitated.  
>  The enclosure for the endangered Spectacled Bear.  
>  Many of the trails which are used for walking the cats.
>
> This is why we have concluded that no consideration has been made for the
> wellbeing of the animals, not to mention the fact that Parque Machia is
> considered an area of National Heritage, meaning no damage to the
> biological, genetic and ecological diversity should be allowed.

_The Democracy Center_ blog notes that some of the[ volunteers have
employed](http://democracyctr.org/blog/2009/09/cocalero-expansions-draw-
conflict.html) a “well-known Bolivian protest tactic, the road blockade, to
try to stop construction of a new highway through the park.”

Gustavo Cardoso of the blog _Observancia [es]_ credits Inti Wara Yassi for
helping preserve nature in this area, [which has provided direct benefits to
the local municipality, which is the same entity that is building the new
road](http://observancia.blogspot.com/2009/09/destruyen-parque-machia-en-el-
chapare.html).

Paradoxically, at this stage where the international community seeks
conservation in all its forms, there are still those who believe with such
extremes that development involves “dominating nature,” as it had happened in
the XIX century, and that led us to a state of things that we regret today.

The blog _Bolivia Bella_ notes that conservationist[ Jane Goodall
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall)is scheduled to visit the park and
could provide international attention on the case. [She also sums up why the
park should remain untouched](http://www.boliviabella.com/save-machia.html):

> In any case, I AM against the building of THIS road. It's not right. It's a
> national park and nature preserve. It's very name indicates it has been set
> aside to AVOID its destruction. For me, that's enough reason to not agree
> with it. Period.
>
> The sad thing is, I visited Villa Tunari several times and I saw first hand
> how Inti Wara Yassi volunteers cared for and loved the animals back to
> health. I was told most of the animals rescued and received at Machía were
> taken from their original habitats and sold to urban dwellers who, after
> realizing how large they grow, how dangerous they can be, how much care and
> food they need, or how long they actually live, abandon them or simply lock
> them up in cages for the rest of their lives, or worse, abuse them.

> Many of the animals have been severely abused and will not be able to live

> very long and gradual process. You can’t just move animals to a new place.
> It requires a lot of logistics and they many never be able to adapt to a new
