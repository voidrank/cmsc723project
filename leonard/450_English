A picture is worth a thousand tweets, especially when [Twitter is blocked in
Egypt](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/25/egypt-twitter-blocked-as-
demonstrations-continue/) in order to halt the transfer of information about
the ongoing [demonstrations in Egypt
today](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/25/egypt-tweeting-the-day-of-
revolution/).

Egyptian blogger, [Zeinobia](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/), decided
to take her camera and go down to the streets and take some photographs and
upload them to [her Flickr
account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96884693@N00/sets/72157625904214898/).
Here are some of her photographs:

In Cairo, tens of thousands of the security forces were seen in the streets
since the early morning in their famous black uniform.

Today is a national holiday in Egypt. The streets were empty. Yet the security
forces had their own plans to control the flow of protesters, especially when
the usual traffic jams in Cairo's streets are not there to do the natural
control of the flow for them.

[![Jan25: Galaa Square](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

The security forces blocked some of the major squares and intersections in
Cairo. Cars were redirected into bridges or tunnels when possible, as it is
always harder to demonstrate inside a tunnel, right!? Some users on twitter
reported that the underground metro was closed also to control the flow of the
protesters.

Rassd New Network published [a stunning photo of the protesters in Tahrir
Square in Cairo down
town](http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?fbid=104031349673983&set=a.103652329711885.5178.103622369714881)
on [their Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/RNN.NEWS) ( **Update** : This

Post](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-
post/2011/01/egypt_clashes_break_out_in_vio.html#more) to see).

In the evening, the number of the protesters in [El-Tahrir
Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midan_Tahrir) became really huge. Midan
El-Tahrir or El-Tahrir Square has been the site for numerous major protests
and demonstrations, including in March 2003 when people came out to protest
the War in Iraq.

Twitter was reported to be blocked in the afternoon. Before that, some people
had the chance to upload photographs to services like twitpic. [@M_Na7as
uploaded the photograph below on his twitpic
account](http://twitpic.com/3tbdn3) showing how the protesters outnumbered the
security forces in the city of [El-Mahalla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El-
Mahalla_El-Kubra).

The protesters surrounding the security forces in El-Mahalla. It worth
mentioning that El-Mahalla has experienced [waves of workers strikes in the
past few years](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/03/19/egypt-waves-of-
workers-strikes/).

Also outside Egypt, people recorded the demonstrations with their cameras.
[@MafazAlSuwaidan shared the picture below](http://twitpic.com/3tbwtq) of a
protest taking place in Toronto, Canada.

Egyptian protesters in down town in Toronto chanting: Revolting till victory,
revolting in every street of my country.

Last by not least, [@TheOnlyWarman shared a photo showing trucks filled with
soldiers in the calm district of Maadi](http://twitpic.com/3ta9wy). Some of
the trucks seen in the streets of Cairo, were in fact coming from less tense
governorates in order to offer hand to the local forces. [And @alasmari shared
a photo of torn pictures of the Egyptian president](http://twitpic.com/3tbov1)
in one of the billboards on the streets.

Meanwhile, Lebanese web developers [Layal Al
Khatib](http://twitter.com/#%21/nights) and [Mirelle
Raad](http://twitter.com/#%21/migheille) developed a new [photo aggregator
](http://abaadblogs.com/imagefeed/)to collect photographs shared by netizens
for the protests under one roof.

After completing the project, Layal
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#%21/nightS/status/29951183443460096):
