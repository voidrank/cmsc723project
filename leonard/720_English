The past months in East Timor have revealed serious tensions between Timorese
leaders, Australia, and Woodside, the multinational company hoping to profit
from new petroleum resources in Timorese territory.

Don Voelte, the CEO of [Woodside Petroleum](http://www.woodside.com.au/),
visited Dili last month, and was not warmly received by the Timorese
government including Prime Minister [Xanana
Gusmão](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanana_Gusm%C3%A3o). President [Ramos
Horta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ramos-Horta) broke ranks from
the Government and at least met with Voelte.

At issue is how to develop new petroleum resources in the [Timor
Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea) south of the country.

East Timor was accruing revenue from taxes on oil exploitation in the Timor
Sea south of its territory even before its formally recognized independence in
2002. The total tax revenue from this oil reserve is estimated to top out
around $8 billion during the life of the oil reserve ([discussed
here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/03/06/east-timor-oil-wealth-and-
national-survival/)).

But there is a potentially huge reserve of natural gas nearby in the Greater
Sunrise field, and with increasing global demand for liquified natural gas
(LNG), East Timor is hoping for a massive second windfall from the Timor Sea.

Timorese NGO La'o Hamutuk [cites on its new blog Woodside's 2009 Annual Report
in relation to the LNG](http://laohamutuk.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-woodside-
says-about-sunrise.html)

> The Sunrise LNG Project involves the development of the Sunrise and
> Troubadour gas fields, collectively known as Greater Sunrise, located
> offshore, approximately 450 km north-west of Darwin, Northern Territory. […]
> The Governments of Timor–Leste and Australia will receive an equal share
> (50% each) of government upstream revenues from the development of the
> Greater Sunrise fields. This revenue will deliver long-term, stable and
> significant cash flow to Timor-Leste and Australia over approximately 30
> years.

The Timorese Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão has implied that the future of
Greater Sunrise is more than about business, that it is particularly
historically significant, referring to the agreements between Australia and
Indonesia during the forced occupation of the country that lasted for 24
years. Timorese news outlet Tempo Semanal [recently described Gusmão reminding
an audience in Dili [Tet]](http://temposemanaltimor.blogspot.com/2010/05/povu-
ezije-pipeline-mai-tl-no-xanana.html)

With a green light, Xanana showed the joint area between Timor and Australia,
saying “here is the area we will exploit together. In 1989, when the
Indonesians were capturing us, imprisoning us, killing us, Ali Alatas and
Gareth Evans, the Foreign Ministers from Indonesia and Australia got in a
plane, and right over the middle here, they drank champagne, on top of our
blood, to sign 50 percent for Australia. Because Australia recognized
“integration” they got 50 percent from Indonesia.

The former leader of the resistance during the struggle for national
liberation of Timor Leste reiterated, showing the area with a green light, “In
truth this is all ours.”

The issue of the future pipeline and processing plant for the LNG has been the
largest stumbling block between Australia and East Timor, and Woodside, the
company with the largest share in the project. Under the [Timor Sea
Treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Gap_Treaty), the development of the
Greater Sunrise field [is to be determined by the two
countries](http://www.laohamutuk.org/Oil/Sunrise/SunriseDecisionBriefApr10En940.gif).
In late April, Woodside and partners announced their finding, that only two
options were commercially viable, a floating processing plant or a pipeline to
Australia, essentially rejecting a pipeline to East Timor's south coast.

East Timorese from all parties have pushed for an LNG pipeline and processing
in East Timor, which they hope would generate jobs and economic development.
Yet some take a more pragmatic approach, recognizing the complexity of the
negotiation.

Another Timorese NGO Luta Hamutuk [wrote in March
[Tet]](http://www.lutahamutuk.org/press_release), after having their loyalties
questioned by the government,

> Bainhira Luta Hamutuk halo vizita ba iha Viqueque, lideransa komunitariu
> nomos povu barak husu kona-ba posibilidade kadoras ba iha neba, tamba
> ofisiais guverno dala barak promete buat oi-oin iha neba nune to’o agora
> povu hein hela ho laran metin hodi simu kadoras. Problema lolos ne’e iha
> nebe? Bainhira guverno tun ba baze hateten tun-sae kona-ba kadoras atu mai
> ona; maibe realidade hatudu momos katak iha tensaun antre guverno Timor
> Leste ho Woodside nebe agora buat hotu sai la-klaru tiha.

When Luta Hamutuk visited Viqueque [District], community leaders and many
people asked about the possibility of a pipeline to Viqueque, because many
times government officials keep promising things there but until now people
are still waiting resolutely to receive the pipeline. What exactly is the
problem? The government visits the grassroots talking up the pipeline like it
is already coming; but reality shows that there is tension between Timor Leste
and Woodside such that things are still not yet clear.

[Loron Económico](http://loroneconomico.blogspot.com), the only blog dedicated
to economic analysis on Timor, discusses the emphasis on the “rapid expansion
of the oil and gas sector” in the draft Strategic Development Plan currently
being promoted by Gusmão. [Blogger Lino Freitas writes
[pt]](http://loroneconomico.blogspot.com/2010/05/plano-de-desenvolvimento-
estrategico-de.html)

> Quanto àquele pressuposto, ele parece ser de tal maneira forte e central a

In relation to this assumption [the rapid expansion of the oil and gas
sector], it appears to be so strong and central to the whole Plan that any
kind of “snub” in this area — for example, the failure in the short to medium
term to build a liquefied natural gas facility on the south coast of the
country — could knock down to Earth the whole castle constructed on this
foundation.

Yet freelance journalist and [blogger Matt Crook observed earlier this
month](http://whatismatt.com/greater-sunrise-development-could-be-years-away/)

> The government of Timor-Leste continues to launch daggers at all things
> Woodside over development of [Greater

La'o Hamutuk blogged [in late April
](http://laohamutuk.blogspot.com/2010/04/sunrise-to-float-debate-
continues.html)when Woodside announced it would choose a floating LNG plant

> La'o Hamutuk, as a Timorese organization which has followed this issue for

_This post was the second in a series of two on Timor's natural resource
wealth.[The first post](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/03/06/east-timor-
oil-wealth-and-national-survival/) looked at the issue of Timor's Petroleum
Fund and budget allocations from oil revenue.
