On June 10, 2010, local clashes between the ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbek population
in the Kyrgyz part of the [Ferghana
valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergana_Valley) [EN] turned into [a full-
blown massacre and further exodus of the Kyrgyzstan-based
Uzbeks](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10300348.stm) [EN]. It
seems that the conflict had been incited by the Kyrgyz organized criminal
gangs in order to destabilize the region and might be connected with the
revolutionary events in Kyrgyzstan two months earlier. Although it's evident
that, even if provoked by the criminals, the conflict has deeper roots.

Surrounded by mountains, [Ferghana
valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergana_Valley) [EN], a densely populated
region in Central Asia, has one of the most complicated ethnic patterns in the
world. On the territory similar in size to the state of Pennsylvania live 11
mln people. The borders between the newly-established republics of Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan had been literally drawn on a map by Stalin
officials in the Soviet times, leaving more problems than solutions as they
left lots of Kyrgyz villages and cities on the Uzbek side and vice versa.
Poverty, rural specialization and high level of unemployment determine the
overall situation.

[Osh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osh) [EN], the second largest city in
Kyrgyzstan, is an especially complicated case, since a significant part of its
population is (was) Uzbek. The difficult relations between Kyrgyz and Uzbek
populations were revealed during the [Osh riots in
1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osh_riots_\(1990\)) [EN], which happened
under similar circumstances and resulted in more than 300 dead and more than
1,000 wounded.

The information on what has happened during the past three days of violence
and turmoil is scarce, since there's almost no electricity in the city.
However, bloggers manage to send the materials to the web. U.S.-based _Yelena
Skochilo_ (aka LJ-user [_morrire_](http://morrire.livejournal.com) [RUS]), as
during the [April 2010 Kyrgyzstan
revolution](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/09/kyrgyzstan-archived-
revolution/) [EN], tried to collect all the major news sources. But, she
acknowledged, there are too few credible sources of information:

Emotions are going overboard, but I understand and share the feeling of
defenseless people… What is known for sure: there's a fire in the Cheremushki
district and fires all around the city. There are lots of provocateurs. People
constantly hear shots. Let me bring one citation, which reflects the overall
picture and you'll understand why I don't want to write a timeline. I know the
author in person and I can rely on his data.  
“… he called me and asked: “…so, no one is going to help us?” I wouldn't wish
this to anyone. I felt myself like a dog….I met them near the tuberculosis
clinic. I took the driving wheel and shouted to everyone that he's a Kyrgyz.
With difficulties we managed to get him out of the district. On the street
there were about 20 soldiers and behind them a crowd of young and not so young
people of the Kyrgyz ethnicity. I don't know what to do.”

_NewEurasia.net_ became the major English-language source providing

[videos](http://www.neweurasia.net/photoblog/osh-videos-from-the-
scene/#more-11535) and [the latest
news](http://www.neweurasia.net/category/kyrgyzstan/) on the development of
the events. _Mil.wms.kg_ posted [pictures](http://mil.wms.kg/?p=1905) [RUS].
Kyrgyzstan-based blogger _sherboto_ [posted
pictures](http://sherboto.livejournal.com/) [RUS] of the events. Kyrgyz
official press-agency _Akipress.org_ and _Kloop.kg_ provided their time lines
of the events (available [here](http://kg.akipress.org/news:218151/) [RUS] and
[here](http://kloop.kg/blog/2010/06/12/12-iyunya-situaciya-v-oshe-ostayotsya-

provided photos of the [crowds of
refugees](http://diesel.elcat.kg/index.php?showtopic=4202010) [RUS].

On June 13, the conflict [went online](http://www.neweurasia.net/politics-and-
society/updates-on-jalalabad-and-osh-unrest-goes-online/) [EN], with emerging
pro-Kyrgyz and pro-Uzbek accounts. (At the same time, there are significantly
fewer Uzbek websites due to [strict anti-internet regulations in the
country](http://en.rsf.org/internet-enemie-uzbekistan,36688.html) [EN]).
Several Kyrgyz websites went down. _Registan.net_ , where the events were
being discussed, also went down, probably due to the Digg-effect. Clearly
Uzbek-biased Youtube user _saveosh_ presented a 6-minute [Google Maps
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWd8hNBaiHY) [EN]. Although being a
valuable source of information, the video presents a version far from neutral.

Twitter tags [#Osh](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Osh),
[#Uzbeks](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23Uzbeks),
[#JA](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23JA) (for Jalalabad, the second city where
the clashes also took place) and
[#freekg](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23freeKg) were used to group tweets on
the event.
