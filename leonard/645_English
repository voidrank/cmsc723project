[Bloggers’ response to continuing wildfires in central
Russia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/01/russia-towns-and-villages-
on-fire-5/) [EN] has shown that the Russian blogosphere is capable of fast
mobilization, cooperation and solidarity when it comes to natural disasters.
The [RuNet Echo](https://globalvoicesonline.org/-/special/runet-echo/) team of
Global Voices Online not only observed the blogosphere's reaction to the
wildfires, but [became one of the few centers of coordination of volunteers
and victims of the disaster](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/03/russia-
crowdsourcing-assistance-for-victims-of-wildfires/) [EN].

Following several weeks of unusual heat, Russian forests started to burn. The
wildfires started in different places almost simultaneously. Sudden and deadly
[(over 50 people have died so far, thousands have been left
homeless](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_\(2010\))
[RUS]), they have wiped out a number of villages, leaving nothing behind.
While regional city forums have been coordinating firefighting efforts since
late July, Moscow bloggers reacted only with copy-pasting of pictures of the
fires.

On July 29, however, it became obvious that the disaster was nationwide, and
it was then that the coordination of help started. LJ community
[_pozar_ru_](http://community.livejournal.com/pozar_ru/) [RUS] was launched.
Volunteers began to publish reports of fires approaching villages, calls for
help and offers of aid. Several bloggers, especially
[_o_liska_](http://o-liska.livejournal.com/),
[_i_chersky_](http://i-cherski.livejournal.com/) and
[_doctor_liza_](http://doctor-liza.livejournal.com/) , took initiative of
coordinating volunteers.

On July 31, RuNet Echo's co-editor Gregory Asmolov [wrote on his
blog](http://pustovek.livejournal.com/309352.html) [RUS] that in times like
these the “[Ushahidi system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi)” could
become helpful in bridging volunteers and victims of the wildfires. On the
same day, Marina Litvinovich
[asked](http://abstract2001.livejournal.com/1214381.html) [RUS] if there were
any volunteers to implement Ushahidi. Gregory wrote to me, asking if we could
do it. My initial reaction was, “No, it would take us at least a month to
start it.” Then, on Sunday afternoon, after realizing that Ushahidi was easily
installable, I wrote to Gregory: “Why not? Let's try.”

It took me one day to register a domain “russian-fires.ru,” install the
Ushahidi package and get things running. On Monday, I published a [post at
Habrahabr](http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/crowdsourcing/100751/) [RUS], a Russian
IT-community website, inviting administrators, designers, moderators and
everyone who could help to join in. Right after the announcement, I received
dozens of offers of help – both with the moderation and with technical support
(about a hundred help offers so far). The post itself received 84 comments.
Bloggers were re-posting and [asking others to re-post](http://teh-
nomad.livejournal.com/463585.html) [RUS] the link to the site.

Wake up! People need help. Russia is burning and only together we can
extinguish this fire. Don't sleep. Someone needs your help this very second!

Users were invited to upload reports (following the form available
[here](http://russian-fires.ru/reports/submit)) and map fires, smoke, calls
for help, offers of help, and report aid centers (37 categories were created).
The reports were made in different forms. For example, _Vladimir_ from
Stockholm [wrote](http://russian-fires.ru/reports/view/681) [RUS]:

> Я сам москвич, но давно не живу в России – есть желание помочь
> соотечественникам деньгами – ибо прочие способы недоступны.

I'm a Muscovite, but for a long time I don't live in Russia – I'm willing to
help my compatriots with money – because all other means of help are
unavailable. Please provide me with details for a bank transfer.

And here is a [report from the village of Borkovka](http://russian-
fires.ru/reports/view/17)[RUS], which had burned down:

People were fleeing with little luggage, only with documents. There was not a
single bus, the lucky ones were jumping into cars, others had to run by foot.
Currently, the worst situation is with the elderly women and people with
little education, most of them are hosted by their neighbours whose houses
didn't burn down. Registration for help is organized in Lazurny, a village to
which one should get first somehow. People don't understand that they have to
go somewhere and to register in order to get help. Young people understand
what to do, but elderly women are helpless. There are categories of people who
need support, there are families with little babies, and the government's help
– 10,000 roubles [about $300] won't help a lot. People have nothing left
except for their IDs.

With support also came popularity. Within a week, the site has received about
101,000 unique visitors and about 262,000 page views. At the same time, the
site has received about 614 reports, with about 50 reports being added each
day.

Due to the overload of the platform we had to find better hosting. This was
the first lesson: **people who want to install Ushahidi should seriously
consider finding a powerful server to host the platform**. In times of crisis,
when there's an overload of information combined with the lack of truly
helpful information, Ushahidi systems will be in great demand. Hence,
overloads are quite possible.

As Anna Vrazhina, a RuNet observer at _Lenta.ru_ ,
[noted](http://lenta.ru/columns/2010/08/05/fires/) [RUS]:

> Историю проекта “[Карта помощи](http://russian-fires.ru/)“, запущенного 2
> августа, вообще стоило бы внести в учебники по Веб 2.0, если бы таковые
> существовали в природе.

The story of the “Help Map” project, which was launched on August 2, should be
included in Web 2.0 textbooks, if any [such textbooks] existed.

By the end of the first day, “Help Map” [team](http://russian-
fires.ru/page/index/16) [RUS] (the title proposed by one of the commenters
instead of the “Russian Fires,” the initial name) grew from two persons
(Gregory Asmolov and myself) to nearly 20 (and a lot more now), some of whom
were journalists, while others were web administrators, web programmers and
moderators from various places in Russia. I didn't have time for security or
background checks – I was giving access to our admin panel and FTP access to
everyone who asked for it. And it worked – none of the people who offered help
did any wrong to the website. Another conclusion to be made: **trust is
crucial when starting an Ushahidi-based system (or any crowdsourcing project)
from scratch**.

Although the initial installation was pretty easy, technical problems did
arise later. Most of them had to do with internationalization and
localization. Ushahidi is a great platform, but non-Latin implementations of
it still need a lot of work. Part of the text had been encoded by Gregory
Asmolov for the [Kyrgyzstan election project](http://www.aikol.kg/) [RUS].
Another unfortunate problem was Ushahidi's poor documentation and [community
support](http://forums.ushahidi.com/) [EN]. Another lesson: **for now, those
who implement Ushahidi should be prepared to rely on themselves only**.

Technical help is a weak point in the platform. It can be solved easily,
however, but **joint effort is needed**. Everyone can help by simply
supporting the community forum, granting organizations – by funding plugin
design and hosting, mobile and Internet providers – by offering Ushahidi-ready
hosting plans.

As an active participant of the events, I witnessed a genuine citizen and
media interest in our project. Various newspapers covered _Russian-fires.ru_ ,
while _Yandex_ , Russia's most popular search engine, added markers from our
map to their [pozhar.yandex.ru](http://pozhar.yandex.ru) portal, bringing more
publicity to our project. A Russian hosting company offered us powerful
hosting, and an SMS-portal provided us with their free service.

As the team of “virtual firefighters” grew bigger, Gregory Asmolov came up
with an idea of creating a coordination center, arguing that it would give a
new impulse to the site and to the whole mission of coordinating volunteer
efforts. Anastasiya Severina, Gregory's friend, took the responsibility of
setting up the “Help Map” headquarters in her own apartment. Responsibilities
of the Ushahidi moderators include not only moderation work of approving
messages, but also the validation of messages. In order to validate messages
efficiently, one needs to contact people who leave reports at the site.
Conclusion: **the online part of Ushahidi is only a tip of the iceberg, a lot
of work has to be done offline**.

To draw a bottom line, the secret of such fast online popularity is that the
project has filled the coordination gap and satisfied the demand for
information. A lot of people expected such a project to come from the
government. _Bablopobeditzlo_ [wrote](http://dirty.ru/comments/285313#5559281)
[RUS]:

> А в МЧС такой проект […] никто не догадался создать?

And why didn't the Ministry of the Emergencies come up with such a project?

Gregory Asmolov, [also commented on his
blog](http://pustovek.livejournal.com/312281.html) [RUS] on the role of
Ushahidi as a civil society tool, revealing the society's potential for
solidarity and self-help:

> Пожары в России показывают что в Российском обществе заложен большой

Wildfires in Russia show that there's a great potential for mutual aid in the
Russian society. It seems to me that this potential is even stronger because
many Russians realize that the government is incapable of functioning, and the
only option in this situation is to act independently. However, while the
potential for mutual aid is great, to make this mutual aid effective,
mechanisms are needed in order to make it function. And that's the strategic
role of Ushahidi. As a matter of a fact, Ushahidi becomes in this context a
civil society institution. These are the first steps to the reality in which
the public forms alternative mechanisms and institutions, in order to fill the
vacuum of government structures.

“Help Map” is the first implementation of “Ushahidi” in Russia. And,
hopefully, not the last one. We hope that following the success of the “Help
Map” project, the system would be used by other volunteers in Russia. In the
country this huge, map-based coordination is of great importance.
