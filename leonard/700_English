Despite the protest of concerned citizens, artists, and historians, the
Malaysian government has decided to demolish the 115 year old [Pudu
Jail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudu_Prison), a historical landmark in
Kuala Lumpur. Last week, the eastern wall of the Pudu Prison complex was
destroyed to make way for a road widening project. A [commercial
center](http://malaysiacity.wordpress.com/2007/10/24/pudu-jail-redevelopment/)
will soon be developed in the area.

_Badan Warisan Malaysia_ is disappointed that the government has
[rejected](http://www.thenutgraph.com/demolishing-pudu-jail-erasing-our-
history/) the petition to recognize the prison as a heritage building

> It would be useful to know what criteria a building or site needs to possess
> before our government will consider it a heritage building.
>
> Surely jails are a part of the tangible evidence of our penal history which
> is part of our justice system. I think that we should also not forget that
> in its over 100-year history, it was not only a prison where convicts were
> incarcerated. It was also where, during the Japanese occupation, service
> officers from many different nations who had fought to defend our shores
> were also imprisoned. Is this a part of our nation’s history which we are
> also not proud of?
>
> While it may be too late to save Pudu Jail, Badan Warisan hopes that the
> awareness raised by this will strengthen the public’s resolve to be
> conscious of how fragile our heritage is and to speak up for its protection,
> conservation and preservation.

_mirage.studio.7_ [writes](http://blog.miragestudio7.com/pudu-
jail-1891-2010-rest-in-pieces/3482/) about the historical value of the prison

> Pudu Jail is more than 100 years old, built by the British with cheap labor
> from India, used by the Japanese as a prison camp to butcher the Chinese and
> by the present government for hanging 1000 criminals till the late 90’s.
>
> I would love to see the prison retained as a tourist attraction or at least
> the gate. Then again, the current policy is to rewrite and whitewash history

[Sarah Kushairi](http://sarahkushairi.blogspot.com/2010/06/imagine-this-pudu-
prison-hotel.html) does not believe that the city needs another shopping
complex

> I'm a bit upset when the government decided to tear down the historical Pudu
> Prison (so that the land can be developed) into a place that houses those
> new swanky hotels, apartments. Blah blah blah. Like Malaysia doesn’t have
> enough shopping malls and apartments already.

_From A to Zi_ is also
[infuriated](http://fromatozi.blogspot.com/2010/06/pudu-gaol-kuala-
lumpur.html) that the mural wall (one of the longest murals in the world)
which adorned the prison is now gone

> I'm sure I am not alone in being absolutely infuriated about the whole
> situation.
>
> The gaol housed some of Malaysia's most notorious criminals. So, so much
> local history, and stories lost – and I don't think a shopping complex, in
> terms of design or function, would do its rich history any justice at all.
> (Writings on the prison cell walls, carvings, peeling of the wall paint …
> why are we destroying stories?)
>
> Kuala Lumpur is not, not, not, in need of another shopping mall. Our local
> history and culture is so beautiful and very much unique, why can't you see
> that? We can showcase it, market it to the world.
>
> Welcome to 21st Century Kuala Lumpur, our prime age of cultural
> deterioration. We are desperately in need of cultural education, not
> imported fashion chain stores.

_BJ Thoughts_ [remembers the
mural](http://balajoe27.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/pudu-jail/)

> It is an iconic landmark in KL – I used to see the mural on the wall as I
> sit in the bus, stuck in the traffic jam on my way back to my grandma’s
> house many years ago
>
> The infamous Pudu Jail is being torn down for development, no big surprise
> there. I mean if some greedy nuts can eye on a strategic active military
> base for commercial development, what more of an abandoned prison smack down
> in the middle of KL

A mass funeral was organized by artists on the eve of the demolition. _Arteri_
[blogs](http://www.arterimalaysia.com/2010/06/21/a-funeral-for-pudu-jail/)
about it. But _pagarmerah_ is [not quite
supportive](http://mockmeat.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/pudu-prison-2/)

> while i am against the state and corporations demolishing anything to build
