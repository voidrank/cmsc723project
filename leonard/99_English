Black comedy is one of the ways one deals with traumatic events. The recent
events in Syria, while bloody and depressing to many people, have also brought
about an explosion of blogs, Facebook pages and articles that try to satirize
the events, and point out the absurdities in the official narrative –
sometimes in very unorthodox ways.

One of the most popular and talked about of such attempts is the “[The Chinese
Revolution](http://www.facebook.com/COMEDY.AND.COMEDY)” Facebook group. The
group tries to mirror the events in Syria, and satirize them as if they're
happening in China. Through photos, videos and status updates, it mixes real-
life Chinese individuals, officials and the names of places with Syrian ones
that are made to look, and sound Chinese.
