On Twitter, friends express concerns for Egyptian blogger and Google Middle
East staffer Wael Ghonim, who has been missing since Thursday. Ghonim, who
studied in Cairo and is now Head of Marketing at Google's UAE office, had
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/Ghonim/status/29632983392591872) his intent to
be at the January 25 protests:

> Despite all the warnings I got from my relative and friends, I'll be there
> on #Jan25 protests. Anyone going to be in Gam'et Dewal protest?

Ghonim, who spoke at a recent Al Jazeera forum on Internet freedom, tweeted
throughout the demonstrations on January 25. On the 26th, following the ban on
Twitter, he [expressed
anger](http://twitter.com/#!/Ghonim/status/30256052310114304) at the censors
in a tweet that would become a “top tweet”:

> A government that is scared from #Facebook and #Twitter should govern a city
> in Farmville but not a country like #Egypt #Jan25

On the 27th, he asked followers to pray for Egypt, [noting his own
fear](http://twitter.com/#!/Ghonim/status/30748650980249600) for the day's
events. Since then, his Twitter feed has been silent and friends are concerned
that he's gone missing. At about 4:30 pm Cairo time, @mskayyali
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/mskayyali/status/31718808758521856):

> Wael Ghonim @ghonim from Google Middle East is missing since Thursday. We
> need your help to spread the word and help locating him. #egypt

A few hours later, @sokkari
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/sokkari/status/31825439655731201) Ghonim's
[photo](http://yfrog.com/h24lkmtj), asking readers in Cairo to share it and to
look for him.

"Wael @Ghonim is missing since Friday," wrote @sokkari," Pls retweet to help
find him."

Habib Haddad, a friend of Ghonim,
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/habibh/status/31790002916564992) for people to
take action:

> SOS: Still not able to locate @Ghonim! Next step, try asking powerful ppl,
> Online and Offline, to make calls and help us locate Wael Ghonim

@mzaher also [put a call to
followers](http://twitter.com/#!/mzaher/status/31816504559276032) to notify
him if Ghonim was spotted:

> Wael @Ghonim is missing since Thursday. If you know anything let me or
> @njarrar know. #Egypt #Jan25 <http://twitpic.com/3uy2z5>
