When Indonesia left East Timor, with one of the most devastating scorched
earth campaigns of modern times in September 1999, it also left the country
with land conflicts accumulated over two colonial occupations.

East Timor, a territory only 3/4 the size of El Salvador, has a relatively
disperse rural population and Dili, the capital, is the only major urban area.
There are very few large landholdings in Timor, with the exception of the
colonial-era coffee plantations in the central mountain districts. (It is
worth remembering here that coffee is estimated to make up an estimated 80% of
the productive non-oil economy.)

The policy of the UN, and the first governments of independent Timor, was to
attempt to build up other crucial institutions before touching the issue of
land rights, which all were aware was quite controversial.

While land conflicts continued unabated, the first independent government of
East Timor did not pass any land law. Bits and pieces were added by way of
decree laws, but nothing addressing the structural issues. Donor nations,
especially the US, pushed for a law, arguing that it would be hard to attract
foreign direct investment (FDI) without a framework for land ownership. USAID
began sponsoring a Land Law Project in 2003. [Ben Moxham wrote in Zmag in
2005](http://www.zmag.org/zmag/viewArticle/13943)

But there was an important, unresolved social aspect to urban land rights, as
International Crisis Group wrote in its [2008 report “Timor Leste's
Displacement Crisis”](http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5355)

USAID continued to fund work on land, and in 2007 the “[Ita Nia Rai” Program
was launched](http://www.sprtl.tl/eng/index.html), which would include the
drafting of a Land Law and two pilot land registry campaigns in Liquiça and
Manatuto districts. Before the draft Law was finished, work began on the land
registry campaign. Warren Wright [wrote recently in the East Timor Law and
Justice Bulletin](http://easttimorlegal.blogspot.com/2009/05/land-policy-in-
east-timor-cart-before.html), an online publication,

In June, the Government of East Timor presented a Land Law, stating it would
allow two months of public consultation on the draft. Under Timor's NGO Forum,
a fairly dormant [“Rede ba Rai” (Land
Network)](http://redebarai.blogspot.com/) was reactivated in 2008 in
anticipation of the draft Land Law. The Land Network sent a letter to Minister
of Justice Lucia Lobato in June calling for at least five months of
consultations, with simple language documents explaining the Law.

Civil society's challenge has been to create intelligible versions of a highly
technical legal language which discusses two legal regimes: Indonesian _hak
milik_ , and Portuguese _propriedade perfeita_ , as well dealing with land
with no title.

During the months of July and August, the Land Network has followed the
consultation process in the districts, making strong criticisms of their
length and content. [It called a recent consultation in Manufahi “a
charade”](http://timorlestelandlaw.blogspot.com/2009/08/east-timor-draft-land-
law-public.html):

> The date of the Manufahi consultation moved several times and fell on the

>
> “Although we are happy to see more discussion on land issues, the Same
> meeting raised few constructive comments on how to improve the law,” said
> Inês Martins of the Land Network.
>
> “This is because people have only 61 minutes to speak, they haven't seen and
> don't understand the law, and the meeting is organized at the last minute.
> Also, because the Minister alone replies to all questions or comments on the

[The Ministry of Justice responded last month to concerns in Aileu
district](http://www.mj.gov.tl/?q=node/151) about the Law by saying that once
the “consultation” period is over, they are planning a public education
campaign about the law down to the local level.

Questions remain about key aspects of the law: who will sit on the bodies
vested with power to decide land conflicts, the future of now-squatted coffee
plantations, and the question of “community lands”. [Pedro from Haburas
Foundation recently asked in a Land Network press
release](http://www.zimbio.com/Jose+Luis+Guterres/articles/1aONTUMkpPj/Timor+Leste+Land+Network+Manatuto+District)

> “There are important questions to be discussed – Who will get compensation,

> Who will help vulnerable people to claim their land rights?”

The question of land ownership in East Timor complicated by deeply-held
cosmological beliefs about land, life and death. For most Timorese, the
landscape is also populated by powerful spirits who are called _rai na'in_ ,
literally meaning owners of the land.

[Former Peace Corps volunteer Michael Jones shares an anecdote from

Writer Pedro Rosa Mendes recently wrote in a beautiful online essay [“Shadows,

The Land Law refers to “community land” and states that “local communities
participate” in resource management and conflict resolution, which seems an
allusion to Timorese customary law. Many would like the Land Law to more
formally contemplate what is known as _Tara Bandu._

Haburas Foundation's Demetrio do Amaral de Carvalho [explained to Grist
Magazine](http://www.grist.org/article/nijhuis-carvalho/) after winning the
Goldman Prize in 2004

> Tara Bandu is an East Timor tradition, a customary law that we recognize as
> traditional ecological wisdom. It involves a kind of agreement within a
> community to protect a special area for a period of time. During the
> occupation this practice was prohibited, so we are trying to revive it, to
> remind people about it.

But the language of the Law does not provide strong guarantees over community
lands, stating merely that the state will “protect” these areas. And given the
global scenario of increased pressure on productive land, many in Timor have
raised concerns about foreign ownership of land. One precedent, [ an MOU
between the Ministry of Agriculture and an Indonesian firm which surfaced in
2008](http://www.laohamutuk.org/Agri/08Agrofuels.htm#sugarcane) promising
100,000ha, raised alarm and continues to linger in people's minds.

[Lafahek Rai Maran created a joke advertisement after the MOU, that says
bidding for all of East Timor will start at US $200
million](http://bananarepublik.blogspot.com/2007/06/pd-hakarak-faan-rai-timor-
leste-ba-ema.html) [Tet], but with some clever negotiation, the price could be
halved.

The issue of the Land Law will mostly likely be one of the most hotly debated
and potentially most protested in the last half of 2009 in East Timor.

_This post is the fourth of a series to commemorate the 10th anniversary of
the popular referendum in East Timor, which led to the territory's
internationally recognized independence. In the[first
post](../2009/08/28/2009/08/21/east-timor-celebrating-global-solidarity-for-
freedom/) we highlighted the support of the international community for the
freedom of East Timor. In the [second](../2009/08/28/east-timor-abe-barreto-
soares-poetry-for-nation-building/), we interviewed Abe Barreto Soares who is
one of the organizers of the celebration events for solidarity taking place in
East Timor in August and September 2009. The [third
post](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/30/east-timor-happy-day-of-
freedom-vote/) amplifies Timorese bloggers’ celebrations while questioning the
current _versus _the past state of the Nation. Next, we will write on the
crimes committed during “Black September” in 1999 and the controversy over the
Timorese leadership's decision to not seek justice.
