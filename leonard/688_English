Pakistan faces yet another episode of terror as one of it's more revered
shrines in Lahore, popularly known as [Data
Darbar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_durbar), came under attack.
According to [media reports](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/the-newspaper/local/lahore/darbar-attack-shakes-lahore-270) the
shrine was attacked on Thursday by two suicide bombers who were able to sneak
in and blow themselves up despite the security arrangements. Huge losses were
incurred as [the death toll rose to
45](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-
newspaper/front-page/06-terrorists-tear-into-heart-of-lahore-40-die-in-attack-
on-data-shrine-270-rs-01) with about 150 injured.

Immediately after the attack, the Pakistani blogosphere was fraught with posts
filled with horror and anger. Most of them blame the serious lapse on security
directly on the provincial government, who's official stance still stays far
from admitting Taliban as the real enemies. In my own blog [I
wrote](http://salmanlatif.wordpress.com/2010/07/04/bloodshed-in-lahore-and-
the-state-of-denial/):

_Ahsan_ notes in his blog [Five
Rupees](http://uk.asiancorrespondent.com/fiverupees/lahore-bleeds...again):

The attack has also disenchanted those who believed Taliban would stay away
from the shrines and other holy places. Clearly, to the militants, every thing
different from their own version of Islam is a viable target. It is important
to note here that Taliban belong to a rather puritanical faction of Islam,
[Deobandi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deobandi) which views shrine-going as
an act of [‘shirk’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirk_%28Islam%29)
(worshiping someone other than God).
[Barelvis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barelvi), on the other hand, are a
faction that believe in shrine-going and many other rather unorthodox
practices. The latter has a long history of peaceful existence, refusing, at
all points, to resort to armed struggle.

_Dr. Mubarak Ali_ , a famed Pakistani historian, cites in a [BBC Urdu article
](http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/2010/07/100702_brelvi_deobandi.shtml)that
the Deobandis, the faction Taliban belong to, has been actively supported by
Saudi Arabia. The translation reads:

> “Barelvis didn't get any support from abroad. On the other hand, Deobandis
> and those belonging to Ahl-e-Hadees faction had Saudi support. Their
> [madressahs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasah) were well funded and
> patronized by the Ahl-e-Hadees scholars. And because of this, Deobandis
> emerged much more powerful, politically and financially.”

A lot of other Pakistanis are also pointing fingers at petro-dollars for the
virtually infinite funding that seems to be pouring into Taliban pockets. In a
rather angry remark, [Ale Natiq's facebook
](\(http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=100000543205516&ref=ts)status
reads, “its time all the Muslims in general and Pakistanis in specific stand
against the Islamofascism exported by the KSA. Barelvis, Ahmedis, Shia, Sufi,
Christians – who's turn now ?”

He also goes on to cite a number of research articles concluding sufficiently
that the Saudi money, trickling down the Deoband madrasahs in Pakistan, has
actively contributed towards furthering a much more radical, violent version
of Islam.

While most of the blogs have expressed their angst over the attack, many of
them have demanded the Punjab government to immediately come out of it's
deluded denial and accept that Taliban are a reality, and a bitter reality for
that matter. However, so far, the provincial government remains undecided as
to whether or not take up the cause of eliminating the terrorist, evidently in
fear of losing a part of its vote bank.
