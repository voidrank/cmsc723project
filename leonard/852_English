Protesters of the [Green
Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Movement) staged
[demonstrations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/10/iran-green-
movement-readying-for-february-11-protests/) in several Iranian cities on
February 11 (the anniversary of the[ Iranian
revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution)) but [were not
able to mobilize](http://www.juancole.com/2010/02/how-iranian-regime-
checkmated-green.html) as strongly as they have in the past due to the swift
work of security forces and a major [pro-government
rally](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=41551717). Protesters did
manage to defy security forces in some cities, including Tehran and Isfahan.

Several bloggers and netizens refelected on this day.

**Making fun of Greens**

_Ahestan_ , a pro-government blogger, mocked the Green Movement and
[said](http://ahestan.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/green-22-bahman/) [fa]:

> After the February 11 demonstrations, green movement supporters will
> probably say things like: ‘Tehran became green’, ‘greens were censored on
> national TV’, ‘Tehran was conquered by greens’.

_Shukhoshang_[wrote](http://shukhoshang.blogfa.com/post-96.aspx) [fa]:

> Now the greens will say ‘Enough with demonstrations, tomorrow we will start
> strikes. I won't drink orange juice to push state-run orange juice factories
> into bankruptcies, and you can stop eating caviar.’

**Lessons to learn**

_Iran88_ , a pro-green blogger,
[thinks](http://iranu88.blogspot.com/2010/02/blog-post.html) that the February
11 demonstrations did not happen as the green activists expected. The blogger
adds:

> Disappointment comes when we are fixed on unrealistic goals, [the protest
> movement] is like a marathon. If we don't learn our lesson we will be
> defeated… We should add economic requests to political and social ones… Some
> in the movement do not tolerate criticism… We should not listen to people
> who are outside Iran… We should not limit ourselves to government
> celebrations and events.

one of the opposition leaders was attacked by pro-government forces when he
took part in a demonstration:

including in London when they chanted slogans in front of Iran's embassy and
called for Iran's ambassador to resign:
