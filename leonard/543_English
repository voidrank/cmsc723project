On Sunday, November 28, Ecuadorians will be counted again after ten years, as
specified in the Constitution of the country. The National Institute of
Statistics and Census ([INEC](http://www.inec.gov.ec/web/guest/inicio) [es] by
its initials in Spanish), the state arm responsible for generating and
disseminating statistical information on socio-economic issues such as
population, housing, inflation, illiteracy, unemployment, underemployment,
calls it the [“2010 Census – Population and
Housing”](http://www.censos2010.gob.ec/censos/inicio.html) [es] but for
research references, this is the VII Population Census and VI Housing Census.

[es] comments on [President Rafael
Correa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Correa)‘s concerns, who said that
some people are taking advantage of the Census: instead of promoting the 2010
Census, his opponents are asking people to sign blank sheets of paper to
collect the 700 thousand signatures they need to [remove Correa from
office.](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/10/ecuador-citizens-attempt-
to-remove-president-rafael-correa-from-office/) But Correa is optimistic that
technology will solve these kind of situations in the near future:

> Ojalá este sea el último censo de población en la historia del país porque
> de ahí seamos capaces de implementar sistemas de información y de
> informática tan buenos como en el primer mundo que nos permitan dia a día
> actualizar los datos.

Hopefully this will be the last population census in the country's history
because we will be able to implement information and computer systems as good
as those in the first world which will allow us to update the data day to day.

Planning for the 2010 Census in Ecuador began back in 2009. First, a mapping
of a total of 469,000 businesses that were not registered began. Then, on
September 1st the training of province and township boards and a
communications campaign also started.

The day of the Census this year is November 28, but it will be prolonged at
least one more week for places where it is difficult for even a helicopter to
take off. Preliminary results will be available in the middle of 2011. _Eco FM
881_ in its [blog](http://ecofm881.blogspot.com/2010_11_01_archive.html) [es],
explains why it imperative to update current information:

> Hasta 1999, la moneda oficial de Ecuador fue el sucre y en esa denominación
> se encontraban los datos estadísticos de la economía nacional, que de por sí
> eran desactualizados, sin embargo, la información existente servía de
> referente.
>
> En el 2000, bajo el gobierno de Jamil Mahuad se adoptó el dólar como moneda
> oficial dejando completamente inservibles las cifras estadísticas.

Until 1999, the official currency of Ecuador was the sucre and the statistics
of the national economy were in that currency, which themselves were outdated,
however, existing information was used as a reference.

In 2000, under the government of Jamil Mahuad the dollar was adopted as the
official currency leaving statistics completely useless.

The Statistics Act (Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution) requires each
Ecuadorian to provide the information asked by the INEC. It also guarantees
the confidentiality of such information. On November 28, from 7 AM to 5 PM,
some 13 thousand students in their last three years of secondary school will
collect that information; 2 thousand teachers will also participate. Students
will work in the urban sector and teachers will visit the suburban zones. Each
student is to survey an average of 14 households and a week suspension of
classes will be in effect. Considered a civic obligation, the pollsters will
not receive a stipend. All pollsters will have the support of the police and
the army.

Raul Zavala’s blog reports that the [2011 National
Budget](http://raulzavala.blogspot.com/2010/11/sumas-politicas-de-papas-y-
peras.html) [es] has already been presented and questions the immediate
effectiveness of the census results. He also explains that there are 30 more
questions on this year's census compared to the last census that took place in
2001.

The survey, which can be obtained
[here](http://www.inec.gov.ec/boletasCensos/cpv.pdf ) [es], consists of 44
questions concerning population, housing, education, access to basic services,
age, migration, and disabilities.[ _Ecuador, la vida en estado
puro_](http://ecuadorecuatoriano.blogspot.com/2010/11/censo-de-poblacion-y-
vivienda-28.html) [es] details the differences between the 2001 survey and
this one. The blog quotes INEC’s director on the scheduled results:

> El director del Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos (INEC), Byron
> Villacís, explicó que los resultados del censo de este año se conocerán seis
> meses después de su realización, a diferencia de lo ocurrido con la
> información de la medición en 2001, cuyos datos se entregaron en el año
> 2004.

The director of the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), Byron
Villacis, said the results of the census this year will be announced six
months after its completion, unlike what happened with the information
collected in 2001, when the data was delivered in 2004.

Tourists flying to or from Ecuador have been warned that airplanes will not
take off during the day of the Census. A government decree of immobilization
will be issued that day from 7 AM until 5 PM EST. No public activities, sport
events or religious services are to be carried out during that Sunday. Safe-
conduct guidelines will be handed to members of the media, firefighters,
nurses and physicians working that day. The Dry Act, which prohibits the sale
or consumption of alcoholic beverages, will also be enforced.

_[Comentarios del Lado obscuro](http://varthdeider.blogspot.com/2010/11/se-
viene-el-censo-correista.html)_ [es] tricks its readers with a sensationalist
headline which criticizes the current government; but, the editor's intention
was to attract readers, invite them to read the questionnaire before the
census day and be friendly to pollsters. He calls on citizens to help those
working on this specific day:

> Los pobres delegados del INEC se van a sacar la chucha ese día. Deben
> encuestar muchos hogares y esa huevada cansa. Más aún cuando les toca
> personas que ni siquiera saben como responder a las preguntas y les toca
> preguntar una y otra y otra y otra y otra y otra vez… Es por eso que deben
> ofrecerles algún refrigerio: cola, agua, Quaker, jugo, sánduches, galletas,
> bolones, frutas, etc., lo que esté a su alcance. Si el delegado llega a la
> hora del almuerzo, ofrézcale la oportunidad de sentarse a su mesa y
> compartir la comida, total, donde comen 3, comen 4, 5, 6 y más.

Poor INEC's delegates are going to work hard that day. Many households will
have to be surveyed and that gets you exhausted. Things worsen when you meet
people who do not even know how to answer the questions and you have to repeat
them again and again and again…. This is why you should offer them some
refreshments: soda, water, juice, sandwiches, cookies, fruit, etc., whatever
is within reach. If a delegate arrives at lunch time, offer the opportunity to
sit at your table and share food, in the end, where 3 eat, 4, 5, 6, and more
can also eat.

The INEC has its own Twitter account,
[@Ecuadorencifras,](http://twitter.com/#!/ecuadorencifras) but no official
hashtag has been set for the topic. Ecuadorian Twitter users have suggested
[#Censo2010Ec](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Censo2010Ec) and many are
[eager to
participate](http://twitter.com/#!/monicaramela/status/2097492229365760) [es].
Some are a step ahead and asked to tweet what questions they thought [the
survey was missing](http://twitter.com/#!/susanamorg/status/2840912816242688)
[es].

While almost everyone is motivated to participate, the provinces of
[Manabí](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manab%C3%AD_Province) and
[Bolivar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bol%C3%ADvar_Province_%28Ecuador%29)
haven’t arrived to an agreement about geographical and mayoral boundaries.
[Chone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chone,_Ecuador), a city in Manabí, and
Bolivar are calling to boycott the 2010 Census, arguing the inaccuracy of maps
will make them lose budget allocations, as reported by _[El
Universo](http://www.eluniverso.com/2010/11/12/1/1356/inec-ira-hoy-chone-
tratar-sobre-limites.html)_ [es]

It is estimated that each family survey takes 20 minutes to complete. The
government is spending 25 million dollars in the 2010 Census.
