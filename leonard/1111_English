There has been much [discussion about the constitutional right to oust
Honduras president Manuel
Zelaya](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/honduras-political-
crisis-2009/). The crisis itself has made the headlines in many countries and
many Latin American bloggers, including Brazilians, are contributing to the
debate on the events.

Brazil has now been involved in an unusual diplomatic situation. Even though
there is as yet no evidence that Brazil was behind the crisis in Honduras, it
is safe to say that there are no similar events in the history of
international law. The crisis has reached the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa
and prompted Brazilian bloggers to discuss international politics in Latin
America and Brazil's role in these events.

Cesar Fonseca, who blogs at _[Independência Sul
Americana](http://independenciasulamericana.com.br/)_ [ _South American
Independence_ , pt], describes the events in Honduras as a disgrace among the
Latin nations because they involve the exercise of power through violence,
bolstered by the military forces and the [hollowness of the
legislation](http://independenciasulamericana.com.br/?p=4306) in place:

Roberto Micheletti, President of the Honduran Congress and the Honduran
equivalent of the Brazilian coup-monger [Carlos
Lacerda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Lacerda), made a bad error of
timing when he allied himself with the military in order to destroy the
constitutional government of José Manuel Zelaya, who had proposed a
constitutional referendum to endorse the new constituent assembly, which,
among other aims, wishes to impose a limit on presidential mandates, as in
European democracies.

For Bruno Kazuhiro, from the _[Perspectiva
Política](http://perspectivapolitica.com.br/ "Perspectiva Política")_ blog [
_Political Perspective_ , pt], if Zelaya was wrong to contravene the terms of
the country's constitution, [so
were](http://perspectivapolitica.com.br/2009/06/29/entendendo-todo-o-momento-
instavel-de-honduras-zelaya-e-micheletti/ "so did") the Congress, the military
forces and the judicial system that ousted him from the country without a
proper trial:

> O que o exército hondurenho fez foi muito errado no modo, mas não, na
> essência. Não deveria ter sido o exército a retirar Zelaya do poder, porém,
> aceita a renúncia deste pelo Congresso e nomeado o novo Presidente, Manuel

>
> Para os que me disserem que o povo hondurenho desejava mais um mandato do
> grupo de Zelaya, pergunto:
>
> Por que então Zelaya não indicou sucessor e respeitou a lei?

What the Honduran army did was pretty wrong in the way they did it, but it was
not wrong in itself. It was not the place of the army to strip Zelaya of his
power; nevertheless, if the Congress had accepted his resignation and named a
new president, Manuel Zelaya should have left the government immediately. It
would have been better if he had done so voluntarily.  
I ask those who say that the Honduran people wanted a new mandate of the
Zelaya party:  
Then why didn't Zelaya suggest a successor and respect the law?

On September 22nd, Zelaya managed to smuggle himself into Honduran territory
and reach the Brazilian embassy in the capital Tegucigalpa, finding shelter
for himself and 63 other supporters on the premises of the country's
diplomatic mission. Immediately, the Honduran government surrounded the
building, blocked access to the place and imposed a curfew on the citizens.
Energy supply has been cut off, as have telephone lines in the Brazilian
embassy building.

The controversy arises from the fact that Zelaya does not intend to apply to
the Brazilian government for asylum, according to an interview he gave [to the
Globo TV
Network](http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Mundo/0,,MUL1313949-5602,00-ZELAYA+DIZ+QUE+PEDIU+PROTECAO+AO+BRASIL+E+NAO+PRETENDE+PEDIR+ASILO+POLITICO.html
"to the Globo TV Network"), and that he is staying in the embassy for
protection and as a way of mustering political support. If this is his
intention, it puts Brazil in a delicate position, since Brazil is harboring a
persecuted politician who isn't seeking shelter, but rather wishes to summon
forces to fight those who removed him from the presidency.

The _[Movimento Ordem Vigília Contra a
Corrupção](http://movimentoordemvigilia.blogspot.com/)_ blog [pt] believes
that the admittance of Zelaya to the Brazilian embassy was directly supported
by Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and [demonstrates inconsistencies that
point to alleged lies](http://movimentoordemvigilia.blogspot.com/2009/09/foi-
chavez-quem-decidiu-fazer-da.html "demonstrates inconsistencies that point to
supposed lies") told by the main players in this crisis:

> A diplomacia terceiro-mundista tupiniquim inovou, em matéria de Direito
> Internacional, criando a figura do perseguido que pretende ENTRAR e não
> SAIR. Costuma-se conceder asilo para aquele que tenta sair do país,
> perseguido pelo seu governo, e Zelaya, ao contrário, entrou no país com uma
> súcia de 60 simpatizantes, o que desfigura a individualidade do asilo. Pior:
> Zelaya está usando o prédio diplomático como “bunker” da guerrilha para
> conclamar seus desordeiros e convulsionar as forças de ordem do país.

Brazilian 3rd world diplomacy has played around with international law by
creating the figure of the refugee whose intention is to GET IN rather than
OUT. It is common to grant asylum to someone who is trying to leave their
country, pursued by the government, but Zelaya, on the contrary, has entered
his country with a band of 60 supporters, distorting the individuality of
asylum. Even worse, Zelaya is using a diplomatic building as a bunker to urge
on riots by guerrillas and aggravate the country's security forces.

Chávez, moreover, is a recurring figure in reports about Zelaya's return to
Honduras. He himself [told the
BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2009/09/090923_chavez_zelaya_viagem_cj_np.shtml)
that he knew that Zelaya would come back to Honduras and that he had helped
the president to baffle the authorities. But not all bloggers accept the idea
of Chávez's influence on these events. For Leandro Fortes, who blogs at
_[Brasília, eu vi](http://brasiliaeuvi.wordpress.com/)_ [ _Brasília, I have
seen_ , pt], this theory is the cue ball of the Latin American press and the
weak point of mass media. He believes that recent left-wing demonstrations
have been covered in a superficial and watered-down way, [ignoring their
regional nuances](http://brasiliaeuvi.wordpress.com/2009/09/26/sem-olhos-em-
tegucigalpa/) [pt]:

Little by little, journalism is ceasing to acknowledge the true characters in
the story, due to ulterior motives. The Honduras case is symptomatic of a
serious intent among sections of the media, increasingly grouped around a
rehearsed “Chavist” bias (South America's new editorial panacea), to apply
this to news headlines every time a left-wing group starts sniffing around
issues – physical or intangible – involving the old landed estates. In doing
so they are using increasingly deceptive language when referring to the
military coup that ousted the constitutionally elected President Manuel
Zelaya.

Because of that, the coup government has been called, over here and over
there, as the “de facto government”, a pathetic solution found by some media
outlets for referring to an administration based on electoral fraud and the
outright usurpation of power. There are even those who refer to the Roberto
Micheletti gang as the “interim government” – they must be joking.

The possibility of the Brazilian government's involvement in promoting
Zelaya's return to his country has been discussed, but not confirmed, and was
vehemently denied by the Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim,
in an interview for the newspaper [O Estado de São
Paulo](http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/internacional,amorim-nega-que-
brasil-tenha-dado-asilo-a-zelaya,438683,0.htm) [pt]. According to Amorim,
Brazil has only admitted Zelaya to the embassy's premises in order to comply
with the international rules of political asylum. Formally, the Brazilian
government advocates the peaceful return of Zelaya to the presidency of
Honduras and the call for elections. Journalist and blogger [_Luis
Nassif_](http://colunistas.ig.com.br/luisnassif/) [pt] noted the apprehension
in the Minister's comments during his interview with CNN, emphasizing that the
paradigm shift in the political world now requires Brazil to take [a more
decisive stance on events such as
Honduras’](http://colunistas.ig.com.br/luisnassif/2009/09/23/a-entrevista-de-
amorim-na-cnn/) [pt]:

> Mesmo que seja verdade (como disse Amorim) que o Brasil foi pego e surpresa
> no episódio (pedido de abrigo de Zelaya) um país que deseja se firmar como
> _global player_ tem que estar preparado, não só para “surpresas” dsse tipo,
> como para assumir, sem hesitação ou insegurança, sua condição de
> protagonista, particularmente nas questões de politica continental. Para o
> bem ou para o mal.
>
> Bom, espero que pelo menos a insegurança demonstrada por Amorim, (inegável
> na minha percepção) sirva de aprendizado.

Even if it is true (as stated by Amorim) that Brazil was surprised by this
episode (Zelaya's request for asylum), a country that wishes to consolidate
its position as a global player has to be prepared not only for such
“surprises”, but also to assume its role as a protagonist without further
hesitation or uncertainty, particularly when it comes to South American
politics, for better or worse.

Well, I hope that Amorim's uncertainty (which I think was obvious enough) may
at least serve as a lesson.

_Gabriel Purcelli_ , from the _[Desabafo
Brasil](http://desabafopais.blogspot.com/
"http://desabafopais.blogspot.com/2009/09/zelaya-e-aposta-ousada-de-
lula.html")_ blog [ _Outburst Brazil_ , pt], maintains that the Brazilian
government's behavior reaffirms its position as a leader in the region. The
sheltering of the so-called “constitutional president” Zelaya, in the face of
the excesses of the “de facto president” Micheletti [is a step which
indirectly allows it to fill the gap left by the decline of US influence in
Latin America](http://desabafopais.blogspot.com/2009/09/zelaya-e-aposta-
ousada-de-lula.html) [pt]:

Brazil's actions, in which the Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and President
Lula are already publicly involved, and for which they are using the sounding
board of the UN General Assembly in New York, must be viewed in the light of
the unrest in Brasília caused by the remobilization of the 4th Fleet of the
USA in the South Atlantic and the presence of this country in military bases
in Colombia. Convinced that these moves are intended to offset its force as a
potential emerging nation, Brazilians will seize this opportunity to assert
themselves, rather than letting it slip.

[_Raphael Garcia Tsavkko_](http://tsavkko.blogspot.com/) [pt] follows the same
line of reasoning and points out some interesting facts regarding Brazil's
participation in the resolution of this conflict. He
[argues](http://tsavkko.blogspot.com/2009/09/os-especialistas-do-atraso-e-
nova.html) [pt]:

> O Brasil não sai prejudicado, na verdade foi forçado – a contragosto talvez
> – a mostrar porque é ou quer ser o líder da América Latina. Não mais o papo
> de que é mas ações concretas. Resolvendo ou ajudando a resolver o conflito
> no país o Brasil sai fortalecido como nunca, sai com mais força para
> pleitear a vaga permanente no Conselho de Segurança – que conta já com o
> apoio entusiasmado de Sarkozy – e sai fortalecido no cenário internacional.

Brazil is not going to be harmed by this; it was actually forced – probably
reluctantly – to show why it is or why it wants to be the leader of Latin
America. No more bluster about already being a leader – now it has to prove it
with concrete actions. By solving or helping to solve the conflict in
Honduras, Brazil emerges stronger than it ever has been; it strengthens its
bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council – an idea
already supported enthusiastically by Sarkozy – and becomes more prominent
within the international community.

The restrictions imposed on the Brazilian embassy provoke discussions about
the sovereignty of the nation within the limits of the building. Although many
people believe that a country's diplomatic mission constitutes foreign
territory, law professor and blogger _Túlio Vianna_ [points
out](http://tuliovianna.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/embaixada-nao-e-territorio-
estrangeiro/) [pt] that, even though it is not technically considered as such,
the attack of an embassy must be repudiated in the same way:

> A teoria atualmente dominante para legitimar as imunidades da Missão
> Diplomática é a “teoria do interesse da função”. Ainda segundo Celso Mello,
> estes privilégios e imunidades podem ser classificados em: inviolabilidade,
> imunidade de jurisidição civil e criminal e isenção fiscal (v2., nº511). Nas
> suas palavras:
>
> _“A inviolabilidade significa que nestes locais o Estado acreditado não pode
> exercer nenhum ato de coação (ex: ser invadido pela polícia), a não ser que
> haja o consentimento do chefe da Missão. Do mesmo modo, não pode ser
> efetuada uma citação dentro da Missão.”_
>
> Se os golpistas hondurenhos invadirem a embaixada brasileira em Honduras
> para capturar Zelaya, não estarão invadindo o território brasileiro, mas
> violando uma imunidade diplomática.
>
> Pode ser tão grave quanto, mas não é a mesma coisa.

The currently dominant theory for justifying the immunity of the diplomatic
mission is the “theory of the interest of the function”. According to Celso
Mello, those privileges and immunities may be classified as: inviolability,
immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction and tax exemption (v2., n°511).
In his words:

_“Inviolability means that in those places the accredited state cannot
practice any act of coercion (e.g. invasion by police), unless it has the
consent of the head of the mission. In the same way, a court summons cannot be
made inside the mission.”_

If the Honduran coup leaders invade the Brazilian embassy in Honduras to
capture Zelaya, they will not be invading the Brazilian territory, but they
will be violating diplomatic immunity.

It looks as serious as an invasion of territory, but it is not the same thing.

It has been confirmed that on September 25th there was a toxic gas attack on
the Brazilian Embassy, causing stress to the people inside the building. The
attack was [firmly criticized by the UN Security
Council](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u629609.shtml) [pt].

The Brazilian government says it is seeking a peaceful solution to the
deadlock triggered by the return of Manuel Zelaya to Honduras. Bellicose
gestures are not possible, as they would result in sending military forces to
a foreign country. Still, bloggers are continuing to debate Brazil's role in
the unfolding of this story.
