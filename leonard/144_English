A Filipino artist, journalist and activist who is being detained by Philippine
authorities has created a blog to document his prison experience and
reflections. His family, friends, fellow artists and writers, and supporters
from civil society have also been using the net to campaign for his freedom.

![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Free-Ericson-
Acosta.jpg)Ericson Acosta was about to ride a motorized boat heading for the
rural town of San Jorge in the eastern Philippine island of Samar on February
13, 2011 when he was [arrested by elements of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52797066/ERICSON-ACOSTA-COUNTER-
AFFIDAVIT). Amusingly, Acosta’s captors took issue with his bringing a laptop
while travelling in the countryside. Their accusation that he was a ranking
leader of the underground communist movement, however, is no laughing matter.

The number of victims of extrajudicial killings in the region reached 126
while 27 became desaparecidos (disappeared persons) in the region under the
previous administration of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Acosta was writing a
[Human Rights situationer](http://pinoyweekly.org/new/2011/04/isang-pagsipat-
sa-sitwasyon-ng-karapatang-pantao-sa-silangang-kabisayaan) on the region at
the time of his capture.

The military subjected Acosta to tactical interrogation and charged him of
illegal possession of explosives. Civil society groups, writers, artists, his
family and friends have decried these allegations as trumped-up and called for
his unconditional and immediate release.

Acosta remains detained at the Calbayog City sub-provincial jail, also in
Samar. According to the human rights alliance
[KARAPATAN](http://karapatan.org), Acosta is one more addition to the 353
political prisoners languishing in Philippine prisons as of December 30, 2010.

Campaigns calling for the release of all political prisoners in the country
have been a regular feature of the political scene since the times of the
Marcos dictatorship. The ruling party has long made it a practice to harass,
intimidate, and even kill government critics and social activists working for
more equitable distribution of wealth and the empowerment of the poor.

One of the new things about the campaign for the freedom of Ericson Acosta is
the extensive and creative use of online tools in the advocacy. Unlike Italian
philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who would have to wait for almost three decades
until his _Prison Notes_ can be published, Ericson Acosta’s own prison diaries
are regularly posted online at
[_acostaprisondiary.blogspot.com_](http://acostaprisondiary.blogspot.com).

The _Jailhouse Blog_ contains Acosta’s experiences in prison like the [entry
written last April
13](http://acostaprisondiary.blogspot.com/2011/04/april-13-2011-press-
statement-debacle.html):

> I suppose I’m still basically ill-adjusted with my present prison set-up. I
> find it almost impossible to write during the day. The heat inside the cell
> is simply oppressive – there is no ceiling here, the lone window is less
> than a square foot, and my tarima is just beside two charcoal stoves that
> burn non-stop. The noise outside and the frenzied – sometimes juvenile,
> sometimes zombie-like goings on among my 12 kakosas (fellow prisoners)
> inside a stifling, cramped-up space are just too distracting, disorienting.

Or the [entry written last April
17](http://acostaprisondiary.blogspot.com/2011/04/april-17-welcome-
visitors-v1.html):

> In many ways, dalaw (visit), hangin (wind) and great expectation are all
> quite synonymous as far as the inmates here are concerned.
>
> The visiting area or dalawan is almost three times the space of any of the
> regular cells. It also functions and is interchangeably referred to around
> here as pahanginan. Once a week, each cell group, composed of twelve inmates
> on the average, gets the chance to lounge here for a few hours. The idea is
> to somehow experience breathing – not necessarily fresh but simply – air.
> There’s almost an extreme absence of oxygen inside the cells, especially
> between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm. And so the weekly pahangin is such a gracious
> respite the inmates anticipate with excitement much like waiting for a
> scheduled dalaw.

The blog also features Acosta’s [prison
reflections](http://acostaprisondiary.blogspot.com/2011/05/resbak.html):

> Yet prior to my illegal arrest and detention, I had long and pretty much
> accepted that, for all its intents and purposes, I had already been a rather
> obscure, almost estranged member of this community. This had been a
> consequence among the many trade-offs, so to speak, in choosing to work
> fulltime in the anti-feudal, anti-fascist and cooperative movement of poor
> peasants and farm workers in the countryside.
>
> Being uprooted from one’s immediate and familiar milieu was, in fact, a
> sacrifice of considerable weight… There was romance to it too, of course,
> and as a poet, nothing of the earthy images of ricefields and barefoot
> children, nor the primal sounds of crickets and crows ever escaped me. There
> would be times, however – and these I think were moments of lucid self-
> appraisal – when it seemed as if I had somehow escaped poetry.

And poems written by Acosta while in jail are also posted in this same [prison
blog](http://acostaprisondiary.blogspot.com).

Apart from putting up the online prison diary, the organizers of the Free
Ericson Acosta Campaign also came up with an [online
petition](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/freeericsonacostacampaign/). They
also posted a [Facebook
page](http://www.facebook.com/Free.Ericson.Acosta.FreeAllPoliticalPrisoners)
that has so far taken 788 likes as of this writing.

Backing for the campaign to free Acosta continues to grow as proven by the
growing number of statements, testimonies, and other articles compiled in the
campaign blog [_freeacosta.blogspot.com_](http://freeacosta.blogspot.com/).
The struggle for freedom by Acosta and other political prisoners in the
Philippines continues.
