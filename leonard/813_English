On Feb. 18, 2010, [bTV](http://www.btv.bg/), one of the most popular TV
channels in Bulgaria, got a new owner – [Central European Media
Enterprises](http://www.cetv-net.com/en/index.shtml). bTV is the first private
national TV station in Bulgaria. bTV’s program was broadcast for the first
time on June 1, 2000, thus breaking the monopoly of the public national TV
station and changing entirely the media environment in Bulgaria.  
For eight years, bTV firmly established itself as the most watched TV channel
in Bulgaria, with nearly 37% share of all viewers and with leading positions
on the advertising market. bTV has a 24-hour programming. It targets the
family audience, offering a quality selection of movies, reality formats, talk
shows and comedy programs. The news and feature programs of bTV established
themselves as the information leader with the highest rating of viewers’
trust.

Central European Media Enterprises, which has acquired bTV, is the leading
television broadcaster in Central and Eastern Europe. The company was founded
by [Ronald Lauder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Lauder) in 1994 and
together with its local partners it operates TV Nova, Nova Sport, Nova Cinema
and MTV in the Czech Republic, PRO TV, PRO TV International, ACASA, PRO
CINEMA, Sport.ro and MTV Romania in Romania, TV Markíza, Nova Sport,
Television Doma and MTV in Slovakia, POP TV, Kanal A and TV Pika in Slovenia,
and Studio 1+1, 1+1 International and Kino in Ukraine.
