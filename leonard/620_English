Which country is the odd one out? Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Malaysia. Okay,
let's say I am an obnoxious author who wants to insult your general country
knowledge and you try to impress me with what you know. So Malaysia is
economically more prosperous in South East Asia region, has better developed
infrastructure, with substantially lower poverty rate, hmm… you may even say
more democratic. But odd one out indeed, Malaysia is also languished way below
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia in [press freedom
ranking](http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2009,1001.html).

As recent development of press freedom in Malaysia unfolds, there are 3 key
outcomes that can be observed:

1) Opposition parties will continue to fight the hardest through online media,
after being granted limited access to print and electronic media

2) Despite claims or evidence of supporting free media, government continues
to hold the leverage in controlling media with information and printing acts.

3) Information censorship is ineffective as long as Internet remains
uncensored. Rising number of Internet users and independent online contents
will shape major opinions and put government under pressure.

When latest press freedom index was released earlier this year, [opposition
politicians](http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2010/05/05/2010-world-press-freedom-
day-ignored-by-najib-government-as-malaysia-stands-on-the-crossroad-with-
najib-deciding-whether-to-usher-a-return-of-the-mahathirish-media-dark-age/)
were quick to react through their own online party information portals and
personal blogs. Their online criticism intensified when government delayed
decision in renewing [opposition
newsletters](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/harakah-
issue-proof-government-allergic-to-criticisms-claim-analysts/), and the
banning of satirical political cartoons offered another opportunistic moment
to fuel discontent and speculation through online media. A citizen, Lai
[responded](http://lucialai.org/2010/06/30/5436/):

> The reason that government gave, believe it or not, was that ‘the contents
> can influence the people to revolt against the leaders and government
> policies'… Cartoons can cause the people to revolt? Wow! Newly found weapon
> eh?

Interestingly, apart from online media strategy to criticize censorship, one
opposition-led state actually took the unprecedented move to table the
[Freedom of
Information](http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/press_statements/press_release_recognise_greater_freedom_of_the_people_through_wider_freedom_of_information.html)
bill to disclose information of public interests to every individual. Anil
[said](http://anilnetto.com/accountability/live-selangor-govt-tables-foi-
bill/) while chiding a state government representative who rejected the bill:

> Today is something of a historic day for the country in our quest for a more
> accountable society…

As independent news portals and citizen media contents proliferate in the
country, Gopal Krishnan [predicted](http://www.malaysia-
today.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=33120:malaysias-futile-
paper-chase-&catid=21:special-reports&Itemid=100135):

Well ultimately, press freedom is not something that the government or
opposition parties whimsically decide, but it is about citizens who demand the
truth and reporters who want to report the truth. Like Attan
[said](http://rockybru.com.my/2010/07/najib-anwar-guan-eng-and-
newspapers.html):
