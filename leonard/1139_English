[address](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlR0Rbfgt9u2Cg39U9gDqY1Av1lAD9AT7ME00)
to the United Nations General Assembly, Libyan leader [Muammar
Gaddafi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_al-Gaddafi) more than made up
for lost time. His speech trailed on for six times the allotted slot, as world
leaders laughed and yawned.

Speaking at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the self-proclaimed
King of Kings, who has ruled Libya for almost 40 years, spoke for around 100
minutes. Topics he covered ranged from criticising the UN structure to
providing his take on the wars on Iraq and Afghanistan to discussing swine flu
to hoping that US President Barack Obama would remain president forever… to
calling for an investigation into the assassination of JFK.

Gaddafi, whose travels abroad attract a lot of media coverage because of his
eccentric mannerism and his insistence to live in a
[tent](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2009/sep/23/muammar-gaddafi-
libya-united-nations), made a wave on _Twitter_. In New York, he
[pitched](http://slatest.slate.com/id/2229338/entry/4) his tent on property
which belongs to real estate tycoon Donald Trump – a plan which was aborted
after neighbours complained. Reactions to this address ranged from calling the
Libyan strongman a ‘fruitcake’ to sympathising with his stance on a number of
international issues.

Many Twitter users gave Gaddafi high points for entertainment.
