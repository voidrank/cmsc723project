The anglophone Caribbean's small but energetic literary blogosphere has taken
notice of a new arrival to its conversation. [_Caribbean Book
Blog_](http://caribbeanbookblog.wordpress.com/), created by the St. Lucian
journalist Tony Williams, aims to “inform writers and readers about the latest
developments in the international book trade and how they are likely [to]
affect the literary communities in the Caribbean and other small-island
states.” Since launching on 11 October, 2009, _Caribbean Book Blog_ has posted
a series of thoughtful, statistics-laden essays on the issues facing Caribbean
publishers, writers, and readers, at a time when literary publishing around
the world is grappling with financial hardship and technological change.
Williams's posts have provoked thought and discussion both in the blog's
comments fields and elsewhere.

_Caribbean Book Blog_ began with an essay titled [“Breaking the
Shackles”](http://caribbeanbookblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/connecting-
writers-and-readers-2/), analysing the state of Caribbean publishing and the
market for Caribbean books.

> … if you speak to many booklovers in and outside of the Caribbean, or check
> out some online message boards where the topic of discussion is Caribbean
> literature, you’ll find people bewailing how difficult it is to find good
> books by Caribbean writers, whether it’s in the region itself or in the
> metropolitan markets.
>
> … there’s need for change — massive change. Otherwise we may well be faced
> with a situation where our literary griots end up being relegated to a state
> of obscurity and irrelevance. To avoid this they must find new mediums to
> draw attention to themselves and their work.

In his second essay, [“Now Is the
Time”](http://caribbeanbookblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/18/now-is-the-time/),
Williams proposes that “a group of intellectual, editorial and IT visionaries
with … pioneering spirit and the entrepreneurial drive” ought to “take up the
challenge of creating an online home for our struggling writers and poets to
help them stand on their feet so they in turn can help usher in a new dawn of
knowledge and enlightenment.”

Several writers based in the Caribbean have joined the discussion by leaving
comments. Antiguan novelist [Joanne C.
Hillhouse](http://www.myspace.com/jhohadli) writes:

> It does take away from the time and energy I have to give to my writing, and
> I’m still working on finding that balance, but I’ve come to terms with the
> fact that self-promotion (ugly word) is part of the process and the Internet
> is in many ways leveling the playing field.

Jamaican poet [Tanya Shirley](http://www.shewhosleepswithbones.com/) echoes
these sentiments:

> I think as Caribbean writers we are now living in an age where we have to be
> more proactive in the process of marketing our work and using all the
> resources at our disposal to do so.

The Miami-based Jamaican writer [Geoffrey
Philp](http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/) — also [one of the Caribbean's most
prolific literary bloggers](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2007/05/14/talking-
to-jamaican-litblogger-geoffrey-philp/) — responds on his own blog, with [a
proposal](http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/2009/10/caribbean-publishing-in-
internet-age.html):

> What is needed is a web site that is devoted full-time to Caribbean writing.
> The site as I envision it would be a clearing house for books published by
> Caribbean writers. Publishers would submit their catalogues, writers could
> upload their photos and reading dates, and readers could subscribe via RSS,
> newsletters, or email.

Philp also lists well over a dozen Caribbean literary and scholarly journals
online, some of them traditional printed journals that also maintain a web
presence, and some entirely web-based. Together with a few dedicated
litbloggers and writers-who-blog, these sites, Philp suggests, could evolve
into the nucleus of a future web-based Caribbean publishing community.

In the three and a half years since _Global Voices_ last [comprehensively
surveyed the Caribbean literary
blogosphere](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2006/04/28/west-indian-literature-
online/), a handful of new journals has emerged, based online and in many
cases using blogging software to publish quickly and inexpensively. [_tongues
of the ocean_](http://tonguesoftheocean.org/), based in the Bahamas and
running on WordPress, was launched in early 2009 as a poetry journal, but by
its third issue it also included short fiction. Editor Nicolette Bethel (who
also writes at her [personal blog](http://nicobethel.net/blogworld/)) in [an
interview with _Antilles_](http://antilles.blogspot.com/2009/06/talking-to-
nicolette-bethel.html), the blog of the _Caribbean Review of Books_ ,
described being inspired by online journals based in other parts of the world:

> I was impressed by these journals’ integration of media into their
> offerings, which made them a substantially different, more alive, animal
> from the printed page.
>
> What was missing among them? An online Caribbean journal for Caribbean
> writers with the kind of turn-around and quick publishing record that these
> other online journals had.

In mid-2009 another blog-based magazine project went live: [_Zafra
Lit_](http://zafralit.blogspot.com/), which translates short fiction by
contemporary Cuban writers into English. Edited by David Iaconangelo, a
student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and running on Blogger,
_Zafra Lit_ draws on the efforts of student translators who volunteer their
time and skills. An even more recent arrival is
[_Town_](http://cometotown.blogspot.com/), launched in October 2009. Based in
Trinidad, it publishes short poems and fiction both online and via broadsides
— posters — which readers can download as PDFs and print at home.

Other bloggers have responded to the shortage — or absence — of serious
literary and cultural coverage in the Caribbean press by turning their blogs
into virtual magazines. At [_Tallawah_](http://tyronereviews.blogspot.com/),
Jamaican journalist Tyrone S. Reid posts reviews and articles covering books,
music, art, and film, in an effort to “help facilitate constructive
discussion.” New Jersey-based literature teacher [Charmaine
Valere](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/10/24/talking-to-guyanese-
litblogger-charmaine-valere/) reviews Caribbean and especially Guyanese
literature at [Signifyin’ Guyana](http://signifyinguyana.typepad.com/) — in a
recent post she tackled the question [“Why
review?”](http://signifyinguyana.typepad.com/signifyin_guyana/2009/10/why-
review.html) And [_PLEASURE_](http://www.pleasurett.blogspot.com/), a new blog
by Trinidadian writer Andre Bagoo (who also has a personal blog,
[_Tattoo_](http://andrebagoo.blogspot.com/)), covers “art in all its forms”,
including a recently launched [interview
series](http://pleasurett.blogspot.com/2009/10/artist-interview-series.html)
which began with UK-based Trinidadian poet [Vahni
Capildeo](http://pleasurett.blogspot.com/2009/10/thisdiscoursehasnostartmiddlend.html).  

The most energetic recent arrival in the Caribbean online literary scene may
be [_Repeating Islands_](http://repeatingislands.com/), an arts and culture
blog run by two literary scholars with roots in Puerto Rico, Ivette Romero-
Cesareo and Lisa Paravisini-Gebert. Covering literature, visual arts, music,
performance, cultural studies, and more, _Repeating Islands_ posts up to six
or seven new items daily: links to articles and interviews, information about
new books and exhibitions, and fascinating oddments. Covering all the
Caribbean's language areas — English, Spanish, French, Dutch — the blog plays
an increasingly important role in spreading information and ideas. An online
writing and publishing network like the one _Caribbean Book Blog_ and Geoffrey
Philp imagine will need this kind of breadth and enthusiasm.
