Laden](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/the-death-of-osama-bin-
laden/).**_

[Osama Bin Laden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden), the iconic
figure of religious extremism-based terrorism, is
[dead](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/02/bin.laden.dead/index.html?hpt=T1)
– finally! [Operation
Geronimo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Geronimo) ended his life
yesterday, in an event which will surely leave its marks on history of the
world, and politics, in general. The news literally gripped the world media so
much that it was hard to find other news being reported on television
channels.

In the wake of Bin Laden's presence in Pakistan, Pakistan's image as a haven
for terrorists has, perhaps, been reinforced. However, the liberal class of
urban Pakistanis have always welcomed any move to eradicate extremist elements
from the country. And the province of
[Sindh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh), which has been home to great
[Sufis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism_in_India#History) who devoted
their lives in spreading peace and religious coexistence, has always repelled
extremism from its grounds. That is why, Sindh has always had a distinct
identity as compared to other units of Pakistan, as has been observed by
[William
Dalrymple](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/feb/12/pakistan-in-
peril/?page=3) who visited Pakistan earlier.

[Abbottabad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbottabad) is a city in the Hazara
region (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) which attracts tourists every year with its scenic
mountains and valleys. In the recent years of religious extremism resulting in
terrorist activities, Abbotabad has also been one of the very few peaceful
cities of province.

**Pakistani reactions**

Osama’s presence, and now death, in the city has taken people aback; here is
how a senior journalist and policy advisor,
[@razarumi](https://twitter.com/#%21/Razarumi/status/64923045982244864),
reacted to it:

> I still cant believe that #OBL was in Abbottabad 4 yrs-a small, sleepy town
> 1 has visited sevrl times 4 recreation.#Pakistan needs a clean-up

As always, social media including Facebook, Twitter and blogs, have been
publishing stories about Bin Laden’s death with varied perspectives: the
dominant sentiment is one of satisfaction – and happiness – on the death of
the embodiment of global terrorism.

[@guldaar](https://twitter.com/#!/guldaar/status/64909886374420481) tweeted:

> Damned when he was alive, damned now that he is dead. Not really looking
> forward to the backlash & the city bombings. #OsamabinLaden

My own [Facebook
status](https://www.facebook.com/aamir.raz/posts/10150180519732809) reads in
Sindhi:

> All those peace- and humanity-loving, and the supporters of religious
> coexistence, congratulations on the death of the icon of the terrorism,
> Osama bin Laden. Rest in Hell, Osama!

During the last decade, religious extremism could not penetrate in the mostly
underdeveloped province of Sindh. This has always been attributed to the
teachings and preaching of Sufi saints of the land especially, Shah Abdul
Latif, Sachal Sarmast, Sami, Shah Inayat and others who not only strongly
supported religious coexistence, but also condemned the way a typical Mullah
would interpret Islam.

That is the reason why the Sindhis have always welcomed the United States of
America and its war on terror; the reaction to Osama’s death is also not
different. They have acclaimed and, in fact, congratulated each other on the
death of the terrorist on Twitter and Facebook.

The following update from Sindhi resident [Xafar’s
profile](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001995051550) would
support the aforementioned:

> W[h]ether it’s [Bin Qasim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Qasim)
> who was Osama’s spiritual father or
> [Tughluq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Tughluq); he tried to
> justify his acts in the name of Islam or humanity, if his hands are dirtied
> in the blood of the innocent people, his logical end could only be the same
> as that of Saddam Hossein. I feel happy to see the secular nationalists
> congratulating each other and the supporters of the terrorists being sad on
> this news. [Translated from Sindhi]

Akhtar Shaikh [wrote on his
wall](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1757228910):

> Congratulations to all the peace-loving [people on earth] and the Sindhi
> nation… Now, this is crystal clear before the world that this attitude of
> Punjabis (Read: Pakistani Establishment) has become a great danger for Sindh
> and the rest of the world.
>
> Let’s come out in the streets and participate in this global celebration as
> this is a great victory over fundamentalism. [Translated from Sindhi]

Another [open
comment](https://www.facebook.com/sikanderhayat.hayat/posts/201022639935930)
came from Sikanderhayat Hayat:

> thank you America and president obama you killed (the) enemy of mankind

[@sanasaleem](https://twitter.com/#!/sanasaleem/statuses/64968597646225408)
tweets:

> Alqaeda was never a one man army to begin with claiming that US will wrap up
> the war now is really foolish.

A while before that I
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/AamirRaz/status/64954032254496768):

> Death of #osama may be a milestone, but not the destination; extremist
> mentality has to be gunned down to make peace, and justice #pakistan

However, does this really means that the reason for the US to stay in Pakistan
is no more? Will America officially leave the Afghan-Pakistani territories?
This is the question that has been rotating around social media.

Famous singer, Salman Ahmed
([@sufisal](https://twitter.com/#!/sufisal/status/64914012449673216)) asks:

> Will Pakistan finally breathe a sigh of peace after Osama's death? 7,873
> innocent Pakistanis have died as a result of terrorism

[@mehreenkasana](https://twitter.com/mehreenkasana) also poses the same
question to Barack Obama, the president of the United States:

> Will this stop the US regime from drone attacking civilians in tribal areas,
> Mr. @BarackObama? Justice has been served, after all.

And
[@SadamMahessar](https://twitter.com/#!/SadamMahessar/status/64945155559534592)
tweets:

> America, now that you have served your purpose! Please get out of of my
> country and let us live in Peace and watch some Cricket here!!

As final words, where Pakistan will have the direct impact of death of Bin
Laden in its borders, over the seas in the United States of America, President
Obama has made his position strong by this act. Against or for, we all are
here to face the music of his death; and, satirically, Osama goes on to his
promised ‘virgins’ in heaven. In
[@BinaShah’s](https://twitter.com/#!/BinaShah/status/64913126444908544) words:

> 72 virgins preparing for OBL's imminent arrival with lots of ice and
> tylenol.
