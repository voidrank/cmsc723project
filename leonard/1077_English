[Blog Action Day 2009](http://www.blogactionday.org/) was an online event
organized by [Change.org](http://www.change.org/my_change/home). It was a
virtual gathering of voices discussing climate change. Bloggers from a
sampling of countries in Sub Saharan Africa were among those who posted their
thoughts, and in this post, we get to listen to their voices.

**Kenya**

The blogger at [Theatre of Inconveniences reminds readers to also think about
wildlife](http://theatreofinconveniences.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/blog-action-
day-climate-change-wildlife-species-will-become-extinct/) and the species
threatened with extinction due to climate change. The blogger also looks at
the extreme weather situation in Kenya, with a drought that has lasted many
months and the expected heavy rains.

> In Kenya recently, prolonged drought – and we can not rule out the effects
> of climate change as the cause – first killed livestock, then pushed the
> livestock into wildlife habitats, then killed the wildlife. Now Kenya is –
> ironically – waiting for El Nino rains to settle in so that it can save
> people, their livestock and wildlife. But the El Nino could be made more
> severe by the effects of climate change. So more people, livestock and
> wildlife will die. Iregi Mwenja, a Kenyan bushmeat researcher posted
> [pictures of the onset of the El Nino rains in Voi
> today](http://bushmeateastafrica.wildlifedirect.org/2009/10/14/good-news-el-
> nino-in-tsavo/). One of the casualties of the big water was a masai goat
> that died in the floods.

The blog [Sukuma Kenya](http://sukumakenya.blogspot.com/2009/10/so-unep-did-
you-kick-habit-just-for.html) took UNEP (United Nations Environment Program)
to task on its use of gas guzzling SUV's that release more CO2 into the
atmosphere than smaller cars. The blogger wonders whether for one day, the
UNEP officials would heed their own advice to cut CO2 emissions.

The blogger on [Katch up shares their experience climbing
Mt.Kenya](http://myblogcatchup.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-action-
day-09-climate-change.html), one of the few snow capped mountains in Africa.
The blogger mentions changes in the ice coverage as pointed out by the tour
guide, and also notices other changes in the environment. A brief story from
the blogger's mother illustrates just how fast the environment has changed.

> I come from a cold place and my mother tells me how fast certain types of
> crops used to grow, rain was abundant, seasons were more than one and it was
> colder. Not anymore. Those days were definitely better and we have been
> losing.

**South Africa**

Rory of [Carbon Smart writes about community empowerment and climate
change](http://www.carbonsmart.com/carboncopy/2009/10/community-empowerment-
and-climate-change.html). The effects of climate change on the majority of
Africans will be severe, and any strategies at dealing with climate change
should provide support to the communities.

> In Africa particularly, stresses are already being felt – climate change is
> not something that relates only to the future. The most vulnerable
> communities are those who struggle the most, as they are living on the edge
> – quite literally on the periphery of economic activity, whether they are
> subsistence farmers or urban slum dwellers. In this position, they don't
> have ‘wiggle room’, or the flexibility to adapt their lifestyles to the
> changes they are experiencing. As a result, strategies for climate change
> adaptation must ensure that communities do have the means and understanding
> and support structures to enable them to keep ahead of environmental
> changes. A key point to be made is that the answer lies not primarily in
> technology or aid, but crucially in building relationships –
> institutionally, socially and financially.

[Poetry and Poesie](http://blogs.news24.com/Poems/Blog-Action-Day-16-Oct-2009)
shares a poem on global warming

> The bergs look limp  
>  to me nowaseasons,  
>  I shouldn't read  
>  National Geographic,  
>  that once was a tree  
>  now covered in blinding shots  
>  of glaciers gliding all the more  
>  readily  
>  sweating in the gloaming -  
>  a new word I coined  
>  for global warming.
>
> I don't need to read  
>  journalistic twilight musings,  
>  I can see when a bear  
>  is panting to death,  
>  I can see the whales flail  
>  in the a-krillic blue sea,  
>  I know the götterdämmerung  
>  is going to be a hot event  
>  Inuitively.

**Uganda**

Climate Change. Its not just Koalas.

[Rebecca writes on Jack
Fruity](http://jackfruity.blogspot.com/2009/10/belated-blog-action-day-
climate-change.html) about her experience in the Global Change exchange
program, that will be documenting the effects of climate change and partnering
with established bloggers in the Global Voices community.

> It can be easy to forget that climate change is about more than trees and
> cuddly animals and fish swimming around in some distant ocean — all of which
> I care about, don't get me wrong (especially the cuddly animals). But
> climate change also has real, physical effects on humans: it's altering
> weather patterns in unpredictable ways, causing crops to fail for lack of
> rain in some places while floods wash away entire fields in others.

**Ghana**

_Jemila Abdulai_ [ writes on Circumspecte
blog](http://www.circumspecte.com/2009/10/blog-action-day-on-climate-
change.html), she looks at the climate change deniers, and those who believe
it to be a hoax, debunks their arguments and sets forth the lessons for Ghana
and Africa. The lessons include Information, Education and Accountability.

> Ghana and other African countries are relatively better-off (I think) when
> it comes to pollution. How can we reduce what pollution we have, and how can
> we prepare for the future?
>
> We should be doing our research and looking at all these models (failed or
> otherwise) to inform our own policy decisions. If we don't keep ourselves
> informed, we will have a situation similar to our current economic systems;
> we'll have policies, laws and structures that do not work for us. Already,
> many multi-lateral companies get away with polluting our countries without
> so much as a slap on the hand for this. That's where our concern should be:
> strengthening our legal structures to protect our environment and
> consequently, our population.

posts](http://accraconsciousforever.blogspot.com/2009/10/blog-action-
day-09-bad09-round-up-of.html) on Blog Action day is done by Mac-Jordan of
Accra Conscious.

We end with the voice of _‘cuppatea’_ on the blog [A colourful life of a Gay
Kenyan](http://colourful-wilf.blogspot.com/2009/10/global-warming-natures-
serial-killer-on.html):

> So in summary, stop polluting, plant trees and be nature friendly! It will
> save mother nature and planet earth and you'll make nature fans like me
> globally happy! The future generation depends on nature. Positive action
> today, Better tomorrow for future generations.
