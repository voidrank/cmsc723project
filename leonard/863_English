“I want all other children born in Liberia- and the world- to lead full lives
free of pain and filled with the blossoms of love, like mine,”
[writes](http://globalforum40.com/gf40/2010/01/hiv-in-liberia-my-journey-to-
consciousness/) Mahmud Johnson at the [blog](http://globalforum40.com/gf40/)
for the youth-oriented HIV/AIDS group Global 40 Forum. He is an 18-year old
former co-host of the Liberian youth radio show, “Let’s Talk About Sex”, which
deals with issues relating to the spread of HIV/AIDS and pregnancy prevention.

Liberia is gradually transitioning from the nearly 15 years of intermittent
civil war that ended in 2003 and moving towards mainstream development. The
barriers that remain are great. Nearly 250,000 people were killed during the
war, and several hundred thousand were exiled in neighboring countries or in
Europe or the United States.

**The effects of war on youth**  
The effects of the war on children are well documented. When the fighting
began, different military groups searched for soldiers in the ranks of
children. Perhaps as many as 20,000 children, some as young as 6-years-old,
were recruited, often forcibly. “They were forced to kill friends and family
members including their parents, rape and be raped, serve as sexual slaves and
prostitutes, labor, take drugs, engage in cannibalism, torture and pillage
communities,” [says](https://www.trcofliberia.org/reports/final) the report
from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia. Women and girls also
suffered greatly. Liberia’s TRC
[received](https://www.trcofliberia.org/reports/final) nearly 7,000 reported
cases of sexual violence. Girls and women aged 15–19 make a majority of those
reported cases.

Despite seven years of peace, bad news can still cascade out of Liberia like a
waterfall. Three out of four Liberians [live](http://www.merlin.org.uk/Where-
we-work/Liberia.aspx) on less than one dollar a day; only half the country's
children attend school; Fifty percent of households in the capital
[Monrovia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia "Monrovia") are classified as
food secure. The economic prognosis remains bleak and repatriating young
people – some of them [former child

– into the economy continues to
[cause](http://www.undp.org/cpr/how_we_do/youth/Liberia.shtml) the government
problems. This can be especially troubling because half of Liberia’s
population is under 20.

Yet, the country and its people are determined to put the past behind them.
The country’s [economy](http://panwhanpen.blogspot.com/2009/01/3-yrs-of-unity-
party-rule-have-change.html) has been growing and the government is
modernizing its infrastructure. Groups like the YMCA have been [training ex-
combatants](http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_11762.html)
for employment or to start their own businesses.

**Poverty and tough decisions**  
However, the continuing economic problems have created a ripple effect in
other areas. Poverty has forced many women into making difficult and dangerous
decisions regarding their sex life, [says](http://billiamsonish-
newsline.blogspot.com/2009/07/fly-executive-alarms-widespread-of.html) Jerry
B. Tarbolo Jr, from the [Federation of Liberian
Youth](http://www.flyliberia.org/). He said this combination has helped
intensify the HIV/AIDS transmission rate in Liberia’s urban areas. If this
continues, the disease will mainly affect the younger generation, he says,
which is one of Liberia’s great resources.

The connection between economic survival and sexual violence has a legacy in
Liberia. A 2008 UNFPA
[study](http://www.unfpa.org/public/cache/offonce/News/pid/1146;jsessionid=D0128AAF155C5EFBF061241BA64C85B0)
of women in Liberia’s Lofa County found that during the war, nine out of ten
women had lost their livelihoods, 96 percent had lost shelter and nearly 75
percent had lost a relative. More than half of the women were victims of
sexual violence, and of those women, half of them reported providing sex for
some form of favors.

**Misconceptions of HIV/AIDS**  
Pauline Wleh, a nurse counselor at a Monrovia-based YMCA Youth Centre,
[says](http://www.merlin.org.uk/Lists/News-Detail.aspx?id=844) one thing young
Liberians today need is education regarding sexual health. She spoke to a
writer for Merlin, an international NGO that builds health services in fragile
states.

> “Years of conflict here disrupted our formal schooling system and broke up
> health services so that youths today know very little about HIV and AIDS.
> Because of the lack of knowledge, there is a lot of stigma and
> misconceptions surrounding AIDS now. Youths are too scared to talk to their
> parents and there is a lack of accessible information. But they can
> discretely drop in on me between basketball games or after a trip to the
> computer lab to ask questions, access services and get advice.”

She says some changes in attitudes have become apparent.

> “In the two years since the centre opened, I have seen thousands of young
> people but only given 291 HIV tests. Although people are keen to talk to me,
> they are rarely convinced to take an HIV test because they are scared.”
>
> The majority who opt out of the testing, claim they will ‘come back later,’
> or more honestly ‘don’t want to know my status, because I don’t want to
> worry.’

**The fight for awareness**  
This social avoidance is what programs like “Let’s Talk About Sex” are
designed to educate against. The weekly 30-minute show, funded in part by
UNFPA, provides listeners with 30 minutes of information and conversation
about sex and [reproductive
health](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health "Reproductive
health") issues, all tailored toward young people. Each [program](http://news-
ltalkaboutsex.blogspot.com/2009/05/ltas-behind-scenes.html) is researched and
written by the four young hosts, who control all the programming, including
research, writing and performing each episode.

“My work as co-host of the LTAS show gave me a working knowledge on the actual
realities faced by my fellow Liberian youth in the fight against HIV,” Mahmud
Johnson [writes](http://globalforum40.com/gf40/2010/01/hiv-in-liberia-my-
journey-to-consciousness/). He says you can’t separate Liberia’s economic
problems from issues regarding sexual health.

The show offers a useful medium for young people to learn about the virus.
And, of course, talk about sex.
