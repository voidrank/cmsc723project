The United Nations Security Council just issued a statement expressing grave
concern about the situation on the ground in Yemen â€“ and the pressing
humanitarian needs and deteriorating economic situation following months of
protests calling for the overthrow the Ali Abdullah Saleh regime.

US Ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice tweeted:

> Today, I told the SecCouncil that an immediate, peaceful & orderly
> transition is in the best interest of the people of #Yemen.

Meanwhile, on Twitter the discussion continues on the future of the country
and whether Saleh, who was being treated in Saudi Arabia for wounds he
sustained in a bomb attack two months ago in the capital Sanaa, would return
to Yemen or not.

_Yemen Updates_ notes:

> Whether #Saleh returns or stays in #Saudi forever, he now knows by heart the

And Dima Khatib wonders:

> Saleh is going home, Saleh is not going home, Saleh is going home, Saleh is

The humanitarian and economic situation, meanwhile, continues to burden
Yemenis. On her blog, _Woman from Yemen_ ,
[writes](http://womanfromyemen.blogspot.com/2011/08/iftar-under-candle-
light.html) on August 7 that she has 22 hours of no electricity at home during
Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. She says they break their fast (Iftar)
by candle light:

> Iftar under the candle light sounds great, but it's not. It's one thing to
> enjoy iftar under the candle lights for one night, it's completely a
> different story if it's something constant, which it is. Since the start of
> the holy month, with the exception of today, we have lacked electricity for
> 22 hours of the day. We devour every minute of that hourly electricity we're
> getting. We often have so much to do during that previous moment. When the
> heavenly lights turn on, we jump with excitement. One of us quickly steps
> outside to turn on the water pump and the other gets the vacuum cleaner.
> Some days we both just turn on the computer and pray that internet connects
> quickly before electricity shuts again. Before we sleep my husband and I
> make sure to charge our two phones, two computers and of course our re-
> chargeable small lamp. At least if we charge those when electricity is cut
> we're able to use [Microsoft] word for work or watch a movie on the computer
> to entertain ourselves.

_Woman from Yemen_ says the security situation is also leaving her jumpy:

> Sensory Overload for the past week, I've been on edge, with ears as strong
> as satellite antenas. I hear EVERYTHING and anything that sounds remotely
> close to a gun shot or an explosion I stop and think about it. I then turn
> to get a confirmation from my husband or anyone near by that what we heard
> was NOT an explosion. Given that we are having DAILY random fireworks and
> lots of thunderstorms, it's often hard to differentiate between thunder,
> fireworks and explosions. This is making me on edge with every little sound
> and making my husband really irritated by my constant questions.

Living expenses are also on the rise. She writes:

> Need a salary increase please $$$$ To go to our favorite cafe it used to
> cost us 250 Yemeni Riyal one way by taxi, now it's at least 500 YR. Fuel
> prices used to be 1,500 YR per dabba (20 liters), when fuel shortage
> occurred it went up to almost 9,000 YR in the black market. It now went down
> to 3,500 YR and it is widely available (hence the traffic jams). While the
> prices has doubled from the original 1,500 to 3,500 YR I'm surprised that
> people are not complaining and in fact happy that we at least have fuel.  
>  Unlike the ghost town that Sana'a became for a short while, traffic jams
> are now back. The worry I have, and what seems very likely is that these
> price increases in fuel, transportation, and basic food items will stick
> even if prices are reduced.
