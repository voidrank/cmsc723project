Just before the intense debate on the Reproductive Health bill, Filipinos are
once more at odds with each other in considering another controversial piece
of legislation: the Divorce bill.

The debate on legalizing divorce took a kick-start when news of Maltese
referendum favoring divorce reached the Philippines a few days ago. This has
prompted progressive groups to make a bolder call for the country to follow in
Malta's steps and legalize divorce in a predominantly Catholic nation.

The debate on divorce is nothing new, see here [_AttyatWork's_ round-up of
talking points](http://attyatwork.com/the-divorce-issue-again/) on the issue
from last year.

[_Filipino Thinkers_](http://filipinofreethinkers.org/2011/05/30/malta-says-
yes-to-divorce-yes-to-secularism/) has a great digest of how the debate was
settled and how the referendum unfolded in Malta. More importantly, it
provides a side by side comparison of the issue between the Philippines and
Malta:

> Aside from the happy ending, which left the Philippines the only country
> without divorce1, the story of Malta’s divorce referendum shares
> similarities with our own reproductive health (RH) debates:
>
> both countries are last bastions of Catholicism: Malta in Europe, the
> Philippines in Asia; both countries are predominantly Catholic: 95% in
> Malta, 80% in the Philippines; and both battles are primarily between
> progressive Catholics and conservative bishops. And in both cases, the
> conservative bishops use fear mongering to keep their flock in line.

For a quick refresher on the differences between divorce, annulment and legal
separation, [Lyle R. Santos has a quick guide in layman's
terms](http://www.lylesantos.com/2011/06/01/marriage-divorce-and-annulment-in-
the-philippines/).

With Malta's approval of divorce, the Philippines is now the lone country in
the world that prohibits it. For Blue Dela Kanluran, the[ debate on divorce
should not be framed on this fact
alone](http://sigarilyosadilim.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/its-official-we-now-
stand-alone/):

> As i had stated earlier my stand is against divorce however, I will not
> begrudge a sovereign nation of their right to decide whats best for their

> of the separation of Church and State).

> Which leads me to wonder, what effects will the stigma of the only country
> which outlaws divorce have on the Philippines?
>
> Personally, I think this will make pro-divorce legislation in the future
> more difficult not only because of the meddling of the Church but with the
> stigma earlier stated as well (Which is not how legislation should be

Cocoy views the near-approval of the Reproductive Health and now the Divorce
bill as a ‘[reboot](http://propinoy.net/2011/06/01/continuity-reboots/)‘ of
the Philippines, moving from a predominantly religious state in a secular one:

> If the Reproductive Health bill becomes law, and it is followed by a divorce
> bill? That would be one continuity reboot for the Philippines. It signals
> that the nation is slowly becoming secular and less under the thrall of the
> Vatican.
>
> As a Catholic, for me, it presents an opportunity for the Church to focus on
> the spiritual. I want sermons and direction that make me a better person. I
> don’t need the Church to tell me what is wrong with government. Filipinos
> everywhere already know what’s wrong with our nation. It is that time in
> history that we fix it. I need my church to help guide that poor maid who is
> always beaten up by her husband. I need a Church that guides street children
> away from the streets, and into education. I need this church to be
> relevant.

Dreamwalker takes delight in the fact that this proposed laws, no matter how
dividing and controversial, [sparks debate among
society](http://www.dreamwalkersworld.com/2011/05/philippine-house-
bill-1799-divorce-bill.html), thus encouraging everyone to take part in the
national discourse:

> I continue to be amazed by how Filipinos seem to be more aware of what is
> happening in the country and how we seek to be more informed about our laws
> – both proposed and existing. In my opinion, this can only lead to more
> good. Never mind that there will always b

Maju brings forward a valid point in cautioning that our [lawmakers should
take up the divorce law with a keener
eye](http://forwhatwearetheywillbe.blogspot.com/2011/05/malta-legalizes-
divorce.html):

> We should also get onto considerations on how good or bad are existing
> divorce laws. In many countries, notably those under the Sharia, the rights
> of women and men in divorce are not the same.

Lastly, here's a good discussion by a lawyer, [Connie
Veneracion](http://casaveneracion.com/annulment-legal-separation-and-
divorce/), about annulment, legal separation under current Philippine laws and
how divorce could plug the holes in the current Family Code:

> Later on, however, it became clear that despite the leeway allowed by the
> concept of psychological incapacity, there was a huge gaping hole in the
> law. Annulment is a very expensive legal procedure beyond the financial
> capacity of majority of the Filipinos. The laundrywoman living in the slums
> who is physically abused by the drunken jobless husband could not afford it.
> In addition to the expense, the process was a long and tedious one.
> Eventually, the divorce advocates started making noise again. As expected,
> the Catholic church is getting more imaginative in coming up with arguments
> against divorce.
>
> It is sad that most Filipinos cannot view marriage independently from its
> religious context. It is even more sad that most Filipinos do not consider
> themselves validly married unless married in church. Very sad indeed.
>
> So, will the passage of a divorce law patch the loopholes in the Family
> Code? It depends on what the law will allow as valid grounds for divorce and
> what the required procedure will be. It has happened before that a law is
> passed as some sort of pacifier. Congress can pass a “divorce” law which
> such narrow grounds and complex process that it will effectively negate the
> very purpose of a divorce. You know, just so it can be said that a divorce
> law has been passed. I doubt if that will satisfy the progressives and the
> divorce advocates.
