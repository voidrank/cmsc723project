Established in July 2010 in Singapore, the website
[sexxie.tv](http://sexxie.tv/) claims it is the world’s first and only sex
education platform adopted by renowned doctors for interactive sex education
globally.

S.E.X.X.I.E, which means Sex eXperts Interactive Education, is dedicated to
the protection of the sexual health of teens and young adults. Unlike
traditional sex education programs, sexxie.tv uses the [online
platform](http://sexxie.tv/en/about-us) to reach its clients.

> With incidences of teenage pregnancy, abortion, STI/STDs and sexual abuse on
> the rise globally, S.E.X.X.I.E hopes to supplement school-based and/or home-
> based sex education to empower teens and young adults to be more responsible
> for themselves and their actions.
>
> When faced with sensitive sexual health issues, most teens and young adults
> consult their peers for advice. More often than not, peers are not equipped
> with the right skills and knowledge to address those problems. At times,
> parents too feel awkward discussing such matters with their children. The
> consequences can be very serious.
>
> A non-judgmental and un-biased resource like S.E.X.X.I.E can provide teens,
> young adults, parents, educators, etc. with honest, accurate and holistic
> information.

The website features include Q&A segments, streaming videos, articles, online
seminars or ‘webinars’, [Twitter updates](http://twitter.com/tweetdrlove) and
Facebook posts. What are [webinars?](http://sexxie.tv/en/interactive-
education)

> They are virtual seminars that provide straightforward facts. No complex
> medical terminologies here. Simple and convenient. Register online and
> that’s it! All you need is your computer and internet access. At the end of
> each session, get the answers to your questions “live”; be able to discuss
> sensitive issues, i.e., sexually transmitted disease, premature ejaculation,
> and more
>
> The presentations give insights and needed information with the sole purpose
> of sex education. Through SEXXIE online talks, teenagers, newlyweds or
> anyone will be [more open to talk](http://sexxie.tv/survey) about their
> problems. Be it at home, office or café, one can easily join by registering
> for free to start learning from renowned doctors and specialists. Q&A
> sessions are conducted at the end of presentation. All webinars are
