October 19 was the seventh consecutive day of nationwide demonstrations in
France against [the pension reform
bill](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9forme_des_retraites_en_France_en_2010)
[fr]. Similar demonstrations have been taking place since early September, but
these have been isolated actions carried out by private or public sector
workers from various fields. On October 12, the strike took on a new
dimension: trade unions decided that the strike would be renewable each day by
a vote of workers. So France has shifted into lower gear. Oil refineries have
been blocked, the SNCF railway and mass transit lines have been affected by
the protests, and striking air traffic controllers are causing paralysis in
plane departures. In the halls of Parliament, the 1200 amendments filed by
opposition parties of the Left are slowing down Senate procedures as they
continue to be debated.

In addition, some new players took the field in early October alongside the
demonstrating workers—high school and university students. The UMP, the party
in power defending its pension reform, is reminding them however that [this
reform was made to meet their
needs](http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/10/15/retraites-cette-
reforme-est-faite-pour-les-jeunes_1426966_823448.html) and that most of them
have not had a job yet. So why are so many of them taking part in these
demonstrations, with such energy and determination?

**Debate on Youth Participation**

On September 25, the student union UNEF called on students to [protest and to
increase their participation](http://www.unef.fr/delia-
CMS/index/article_id-3139/topic_id-135/mobilisation-contre-la-reforme-des-
retraites-l'unef-appelle-les-jeunes-a-ampli.html), as did SUD Etudiant and the
FSE (two university student unions), as well as the high school unions UNL and
FIDL, who called for the organization of general assemblies in late September
for the strikes in October. Prior to the October 12 strikes, there were very
few high school and university students involved in the protests because they
had just begun their school year and the strikes were taking place only
sporadically. But since October 12, when the strikes became renewable,
students have been having no trouble blocking their high school or university.
As a result, on October 19, between [379 and 1200 high
schools](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/social/20101019.OBS1515/140-000-lyceens-
ont-defile-selon-l-union-nationale-lyceenne.html) and between [six and 20
universities](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/social/20101019.OBS1477/379-lycees-
sont-perturbes-annonce-le-ministere.html) were disrupted or blockaded.

The debate took a significant political turn after Ségolène Royal, member of
the major opposition party, the Socialists, [spoke on TV on October
11](http://www.lepost.fr/article/2010/10/13/2262931_l-ump-reagit-aussi-fort-
car-segolene-royal-fait-peur-au-gouvernement.html). The next day, the
opposition turned against her, pointing to the swarms of young people now
entering the fray and [accusing her of inciting youth to take to the
streets](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/social/20101011.OBS1133/retraites-
l-opposition-accusee-d-instrumentaliser-les-jeunes.html) for a reform they
don’t understand. _Shmilblick_ also[ joined
in](http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101013123857AAdAYpm):

In his blog, La boîte de Guillermo (Guillermo’s mailbox), Guillermo [plays
down Ségolène Royal’s role](http://laboitedeguillermo.over-blog.com/) while
knocking her down at the same time:

> People are still wondering today. Why are high school students striking? For
> retirement? It can’t be, three-fourths of them don’t even know what trade
> they’ll be in later on.
>
> There was a time when they listened to Ségolène Royal. She held political

> young people were behind her (I’m speaking about well-adjusted young people,
> of course; other youth followed Nicolas. But all you had to do was look at
> how they dressed and listen to the way they talked to understand that those
> young people were already very old). But what high schooler listens to
> Ségolène Royal now?
>
> So I’m shocked by everyone who was proclaiming loud and clear yesterday that

**The Demands**

Thus many people think the students’ motivations are weak. However, they have
[the right to express their
objections](http://bellaciao.org/fr/spip.php?article108357) to this reform,
especially since they will be in the labor market very soon. A
[charter](http://revoltescolaire.skyrock.com/) published on the blog
_révoltescolaire_ and signed by numerous political trade unions, as well as
high school and university student unions, lists young people’s demands:

> The increased duration of an education and an increase in the average age of
> entry into stable employment (age 27) are causing young people to start
> contributing to pension funds later than in the past. We demand:
>
> • validation of years devoted to studies and training in calculations of
> years of pensionable service leading to eligibility, so that every young
> person is guaranteed the ability to study without being worried about his
> future, no matter how far off;
>
> • validation of internship periods, integrated into a real and binding
> regulation (compensation at 50% of minimum wage starting with first month,
> recognition and coaching during training);
>
> • validation of periods of forced inactivity, and consideration of the
> circumstances of young people who have found an occupational placement but
> for whom successive internships, limited-term contracts, part-time
> employment, temporary work, or unemployment lead them to accumulate very
> partial retirement benefits

Beyond the effects of this reform, it is the frustration that these young
people are feeling about their present and their future that is being
expressed: [schooling that takes longer and longer and grows more and more
expensive](http://www.francesoir.fr/social/les-lyceens-expriment-le-malaise-
dune-generation.38515), problems of access to housing, an increase in
unemployment ([employment rate of 31.4% for ages
15-24](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=98&ref_id=CMPTEF03135),
in 14th place in European Union), professional insecurity, decrease in
purchasing power, [widening gap with upper
classes](http://www.rue89.com/node/170597)…the [pessimism of French
youth](http://paris.cafebabel.com/fr/post/2009/04/08/faut-il-que-jeunesse-se-
passe) is ubiquitous.

Guilaume Erner sums it up in[ his
blog](http://sites.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/blog/b/comments.php?id=19&post=3788):

> The youth of France no longer believe in the future, this feeling has an
> activating force, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, a belief that is
> actually translated into fact. Pessimism among the young is leading the age
> group that should be the most adventurous, the one that is supposed to
> symbolize risk-taking, to act cautiously, precisely the behavior that
> inhibits society where they should be shaking it up. At this rate, we will
> soon be able to say, “Keep running old folks, the young people are right
> behind you.

**Outbreaks of Violence**

Faced with a sense of not being heard, young people are becoming radicalized.
And the [youth can be frightening, ](http://www.marianne2.fr/Retraites-la-
fievre-jeune-fait-peur-a-l-Elysee_a198271.html?com#comments) because they are
capable of gathering spontaneously in varying degrees of organization via
[social networks ](http://www.france24.com/fr/20101016-reforme-retraite-
mobilisation-lycee-lyceen-jeunes-manifestations-reseaux-sociaux-facebook-
internet-web-twitter)(example of a Facebook message
[here](http://laurelzuckerman.typepad.fr/sorbonneconfidential/2010/10/instructions-d%25C3%25A9taill%25C3%25A9es-
pour-un-blocus-de-lyc%25C3%25A9e-envoy%25C3%25A9es-sur-facebook-.html)). The
police are no longer hesitating to hold back the demonstrators. On October 12,
[a young demonstrator received a serious head
wound](http://engreve.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/un-jeune-blesse-a-caen/); on
October 14th, in Montreuil, [a high school student was seriously wounded in
the eye by a flash-ball](http://www.rue89.com/2010/10/14/video-des-
affrontements-entre-lyceens-et-policiers-171135). As
[_soloon_](http://www.rue89.com/2010/10/14/video-des-affrontements-entre-
lyceens-et-policiers-171135) predicts in a commentary on the article:

> We have all the ingredients for causing the protest movement to harden its
> position. The generation gap is over, all united in the face of the same
> enemy who spreads terror with its armed thugs in uniform
>
> I’d like to extend my warmest thanks to the police officers who shot at high
> school students with flash-balls, without that monumental gaffe, it may not
> have been possible

From that day on, each day of demonstration saw violence, orchestrated by
individuals mixing in with the demonstrators at the protest sites
(particularly around high schools), all across France. [October
18](http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/videos-violences-en-marge-de-manifs-
lyceennes-290-interpellations-18-10-2010-1114232.php) and
[19](http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/manifestation-70-interpellations-
a-lyon_928993.html) were particularly violent, especially in Lyon and the
Paris region. Thus people are pointing a finger at the student movements and
marginalizing them, accusing them of not guiding their movement properly,
while the students themselves criticize an[ excessive police
presence](http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/fait-divers/les-lyceens-
denoncent-la-violence-policiere_928097.html?xtor=x). That, at least, is how
[the foreign press is reporting this social conflict, broadcasting mainly
images of urban guerilla warfare and giving very little press to the reasons
](http://www.france24.com/fr/20101019-presse-etrangere-incidents-
manifestations-reforme-retraites-france-reveillent-le-spectre-mai-68)and
motivations of the demonstrators.

We will see how this conflict develops, with the [government remaining
inflexible](http://www.metrofrance.com/info/le-gouvernement-fait-le-pari-de-
la-fermete/mjjr!k45k6ZFjOY5e2/) in its desire to pass its reform bill,
[despite the disapproval of the majority of the
French](http://actu.voila.fr/actualites/france/2010/10/19/retraites-la-
fermete-de-sarkozy-desapprouvee-par-65-des-francais-selon-un-
sondage_601812.html). As for the student demonstrators, the vacation period
beginning on October 23 may remove them from the demonstrations.
