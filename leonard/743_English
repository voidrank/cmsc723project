[Video Volunteers](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/10/11/india-community-
journalism-with-video-volunteers/) aims to empower the world’s poorest
citizens to participate in the [community media
movement](http://www.videovolunteers.org/about/) and make their voices heard.
On May 3, [World Press Freedom
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day), [Video
Volunteers](http://www.videovolunteers.org/) launched
[IndiaUnheard](http://indiaunheard.videovolunteers.org/), an initiative
involving a network of [Community
Correspondents](http://indiaunheard.videovolunteers.org/community-
correspondents/) around India who will produce video stories about life in
their community, and the issues ignored by mainstream media.

The Community Correspondents represent some of India's most marginalised
communities, such as [Dalits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit), tribal
people, and members of religious, linguistic and sexual minorities, and they
will report on issues that are important to these communities but are not
reported by the mainstream media. _Brian Conley_ , Programme Director of
IndiaUnheard, explained in an interview with Global Voices:

> IndiaUnheard is a program to enable local people to spread the issues of
> their community to the wider world. Fundamentally we hope that by increasing
> the reach of local voices in some of the most rural and marginalized areas
> of India, we can increase the visibility of local problems to the Indian
> government and the international community. The hope is that by leveraging
> social media and a variety of new technology, we can build an audience for
> the type of journalism that has never before existed in India. We also hope
> to create a space where the audience may interact directly with our
> correspondents, creating conduits from outside India into some of the least
> accessible areas.
>
> We have chosen 30 Community Correspondents from all over India; our goal was
> to select individuals from some of the most marginalized areas of the
> country, and by and large we have been successful with that. Many of these
> Community Correspondents have had no formal media training previously to
> this program and a few had never even held a camera.

This video introduces _IndiaUnheard_ :

Before the project was officially launched the Community Correspondents met in
Ahmedabad, Gujarat for two weeks of training in video production and
journalism. You can see [some photos of the training
here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/videovolunteers/sets/72157624016229226/).
The videos they are now making are available on the [IndiaUnheard
website](http://indiaunheard.videovolunteers.org/), where they are categorised
according to topic and region.

Community Correspondent _Pratibha Rolta_ tells the story of children missing
out on an education:

_Mahima Kaul_ of IndiaUnheard writes on her blog about what she believes the
initiative can [achieve](http://lifeandtimes75.blogspot.com/2010/03/india-
unheard-community-correspondents.html):

> Along with the basic needs of food, water, infrastructure that communities
> need, there is a crucial need for creation of a media outlet which can both
> educate and offer a platform for carrying voices. All too often small
> communities are fed information from bigger cities, and to that end, this
> information often has no local resonance. To train local community members
> to become journalists helps them identity their problems and address them in
> constructive ways. There is a feeling in the community that ‘someone is
> listening to us’ which further leads to the confidence that they are too
> included in the democratic process (beyond election time). For individual
> members of community media, who are often from the most neglected parts of
> society – so-called lower castes, women, religious and sexual minorities –
> it is both a voice and also a paradigm shift in terms of professions
> available to them. The tag of ‘journalist’ allows their social status to
> rise and in turn they can help raise the profile of their community.
