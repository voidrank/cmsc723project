_Editor's Note: This is the first in a 3-part series about graffiti and other
urban art from various Latin American countries._

Although its modern incarnation [originated in United States three decades
ago,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti#Modern_graffiti) graffiti art can
be found in the urban areas of almost every country. By now, the drawings and
messages sprayed on walls, murals, and other spaces have been widely covered
by both citizen and traditional media. They are also slowly gaining
recognition as a controversial art, along with the rise of other urban
expressions like stencils, posters, stickers, and mixed techniques.

In public spaces, street art (or urban art) represents the voice of the
community, marginal groups, and young people that strive to be heard, often
defying the notion of private property. Latin America is not an exception for
this. Some of [Latin American street
art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti#South_America) is distinct from
what is created by the hip-hop movement, focusing on political messages and
stories of struggle that speak directly to the viewer.

Through the lens of bloggers, Flickr users and communities, and contributors
on YouTube, we offer you an online tour of the art of the streets that
communicate secrets and passions at every turn.

Internet users preserve art because photographed walls neither wash away, nor
decay with time. They can also provide information of the artist's name or
pseudonym, location, description, and put the art into context. In a group
about [Peruvian graffiti](http://www.flickr.com/groups/830025@N22/) on Flickr,
there is a discussion about the short careers of the artists, user DeCe-RTOR
[pointed out some of social responsibilities
[es]](http://www.flickr.com/groups/830025@N22/discuss/72157608513795062/#comment72157622803514992)
of the street art in Perú:

Street art in Peru needs to be reformed, because it has always been torn apart
by terrorism, corruption, a faulty educational system, and overall party. With
all of those issues, it is difficult to move forward in any direction. That is
no way for this country to develop, and the art goes by the way of
development. If it is not cultivated, then there cannot be any high
expectations. For those who clearly know what graffiti is, and practices it, I
hope that they are aware of the power of being on the streets. It must be
handled with responsibility, and sometimes one must sacrifice and do what is
best. This sometimes means to refrain from painting egocentrically and paint
only what one wants, and what only one can understand. They must be strong-
willed to represent what the community wants to see and needs know. To look
for the way to make what everybody likes what you like, that is the hard part.

On a more personal level, blogger Luis Fonseca wanders through the streets of
Lima taking pictures of urban art, which he shares in his blog _[Cazador de
graffitis [es]](http://cazadordegraffitis.blogspot.com/)_ with songs, poetry,
and [reflections on the works like the one shown above
[es]](http://cazadordegraffitis.blogspot.com/2008/11/sentimientos-
ocultos.html):

> Iba en el bus un poco mal por cosas de la vida y pensaba que nadie la podía
> estar pasando peor que yo. Levante la mirada y [vi esta imagen en un muro
> [es]](http://cazadordegraffitis.blogspot.com/2008/11/sentimientos-

I was on the bus not feeling well because of life and thinking that nobody
could be having a rougher time than me. I looked up and [saw this picture on a
wall [es]](http://cazadordegraffitis.blogspot.com/2008/11/sentimientos-
ocultos.html), I quickly thought that my problem was nothing compared to
others who spend more time sunk in problems, than living in peace.

Sometimes the communication is even more direct: graffiti artists like Faber
take advantage of the anonymity the electronic media grants to promote their
work, to show by themselves and their portfolio without any risk of being
prosecuted. With minimal commentaries (“busca la sencillez de las cosas” /
“look for the simplicity in things”), Faber shares through
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/210f483r/ ) and [Fotolog
[es]](http://www.fotolog.com/faberoner/ ) his colorful portraits of sad
characters, some of them in poverty, without revealing much of himself except
his incredible abilities to create:

Common graffiti is known for being a ‘code’: only members of the neighborhoods
can understand the intricate traces and calligraphy, the “wild style”, or the
code numbers used to represent names and places. However, along with these
obscure messages, explicit messages can also be found on the streets, using
clear and spaced letters, leaning towards protest. On his blog _Globalizado
[es]_ , Peruvian blogger [Juan Arellano shares photos of the graffiti he found
](http://arellanos.blogspot.com/2009/11/graffitis-en-pasto.html ) in Pasto,
Colombia, and he concedes that most of the times he does not understand it:

> En realidad no soy tan aficionado a los graffitis, la mayor parte de veces
> ni siquiera entiendo que dicen dada la complicada grafía que utilizan muchos
> de los graffiteros, pero cuando el mensaje va claro y directo obviamente que
> si.

Actually I am not a big fan of graffiti, most of the times I don't even
understand what they say because of the complex tracing used by most of the
graffiti artists, but when the message goes clear and direct, then of course I
do.

An extensive gallery of explicit graffiti can be found on _[El Blog Canalla
[es]](http://elblogcanalla.tumblr.com/)_ , where [El Reticente
[es]](http://twitter.com/Elreticente) and [Alejandro
[es]](http://twitter.com/alejandroangel) collect politically oriented street
art on the streets of Medellín. Although they barely comment on their
collection, their slogan holds a message of protest:

> Si los medios son del Estado, las paredes son Nuestras

If the media belongs to the State, the walls are Ours

This is a photo taken in the streets of Bogotá, that reads “Huya, lucha, y
vuelve a nacer” (“Run away, fight, and be born again”):

“Writers” is how graffiti artists call themselves because of their use of
quick signatures (called _tags_ ) and bombed letters (known as _bombs_ ). In
the case of Ricardo (alias [NEARsyx [es]](http://twitter.com/nearsyx)), he is
a grafitti writer, and also a blogger at [_Hemisferio Urbano
[es]_](http://hemisferio-urbano.com/) he shares events, profiles of [other
graffiti artists](http://hemisferio-urbano.com/2008/05/11/woset-
graffiti-3d-guatemalteco/), gathers media coverage of the movement, and also
sums up the feeling of his graffiti crews and the community.

In 2007, [he documented the situation of the graffiti in Guatemala
[es]](http://hemisferio-urbano.com/2007/07/18/el-graffiti-en-guatemala/) and
criticized how television coverage does not differentiate “artistic” graffiti
from “vandal” graffiti, the latter commonly associated with illegal tags and
bombs:

> Lastimosamente aquí, y creo que en muchos otros lugares, el graffiti aun se
> asocia bastante a las pandillas, un claro ejemplo de esto es un pequeño
> documental que recientemente realizo Noti7, un noticiero local, donde la
> edición de este fue parte crucial para dejar a todo mundo bastante
> confundido y con la misma imagen de que el graffiti es de pandilleros.
>
> En el documental aparecen algunos de los que si realmente forman parte del
> movimiento artístico, lo malo es que las imágenes de piezas y entrevistas
> con ellos fueron mezcladas con imágenes del graffiti pandillero, algo que
> nos dejo con una mal sabor de boca a todos los que formamos parte de la
> verdadera comunidad del graff.

Sadly here, and I think in other places too, graffiti is commonly associated
with gangs, a clear example of this is a recent documentary made by Noti7, a
local news show, where the video was edited in a way that left the audience in
confusion and holding the same idea that the graffiti is for vandals.

In the documentary, some appeared that really do belong to the artistic
movement, the bad thing is that the pictures of the [graffiti] pieces and the
interviews they did were mixed with the images of the graffiti vandalism,
something that left a bitter taste for us, who belong to the real community of
graffiti.

Nonetheless, both artistic and “non-artistic” graffiti share walls and
prolonged murals as shown in the video from user
[Artesinley](http://www.youtube.com/user/ArteSinLey) of some streets in
Guatemala City:
