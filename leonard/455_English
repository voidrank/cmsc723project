The Department of Home Affairs [has
confirmed](http://www.sme.sk/c/5729942/pomoc-pre-haiti-brzdia-colnici-desat-
mesiacov.html) (SLO) that a container with the second shipment of humanitarian
aid from Slovakia has been blocked by the customs in Haiti for nearly ten
months.

This problem, however, concerns not only Slovakia's shipment. As Vladimir
Krčméry, Rector of the Bratislava-based St. Elisabeth University College of
Health and Social Work, reports, hundreds of containers from other countries
have also been detained by the Haiti customs – because “things that take a
week to arrange [elsewhere], require a year” there. NGOs are often blamed for
being slow, but Krčméry claims that only those that can bribe are fast, and
that corruption is the biggest enemy.

The second shipment of humanitarian aid for Haiti contains nine tons of
emergency quarters, nutrition and clothes, worth 177,300 euros. The first
shipment had been sent ten days after [the Jan. 12, 2010,
earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake).

Below are a few readers’ comments to the _SME.sk_ article on the humanitarian
aid delivery failure (linked to above), which show how problems in disaster-
stricken, faraway lands are seen from Slovakia.
