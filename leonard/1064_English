Sina Vann was 13 when she came to Cambodia from Vietnam on what was supposed
to be a vacation. Instead, she was sold as a sex slave and spent the next two
years in a brothel. She was freed when Somaly Mam, an anti-slavery activist
and the face of the Somaly Mam Foundation, organized a raid on Vann's brothel.
Today, Vann is [an activist](http://www.somaly.org/programs/voices-for-
change/) with the Somaly Mam Foundation, helping fellow survivors of slavery
as well as those still working in brothels.

For Vann's work, she was honored with the Frederick Douglass Award. The
[Frederick Douglass Award](http://www.freetheslaves.net/Page.aspx?pid=504)
“honors the tremendous resilience of the human spirit and emphasizes that many
of the survivors of modern-day slavery go on to help others to freedom.”

More of Vann's story is revealed in this video:

addressing the humans rights situation in Cambodia. According to [_The

reporting to the Human Rights Council:

> expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Cambodia. According
> to his report, the rule of law in Cambodia is weak…Also, he mentioned the

[Others
urged](http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1313923&ct=7536413)
the Special Rapporteur not to forget about the women and children who remain
victims of sexual slavery in Cambodia, noting that it must remain a human
rights priority even as other human rights violations, such as freedom of
expression, surface.
