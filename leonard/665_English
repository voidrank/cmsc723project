All it took was one child to talk about his destroyed school in front of a
camera: through the following months, thanks to Shawn Ahmed of the Uncultured
Project and Nerdfighters, the world rallied through YouTube and raised enough
money to rebuild the school.

[This video ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dsjtJMqsE)tells the story:
Cyclon Sidr hit Bangladesh back in 2007: Shawn recorded the damage, shocked at
so many children's lives who were lost and then focused on a boy, Pidahouse, a
survivor who took him around the town showing him the damage done to the
school. After the video aired, the Nerdfighters, a community around the
[VlogBrothers YouTube channel
](http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)helped the[ Uncultured
Project](http://uncultured.com/donations) raise money to help the boy. First
raising enough to repair the roof and then, as more money came in, to rebuild,
repaint the school and even get new desks. What makes it even more impressive
is that those donations aren't even tax-exempt since as Shawn [writes in his
site:](http://uncultured.com/donations)

> This isn’t a charity or NGO – this is just an experiment in charitable
> community.
>
> Because it’s not anything formal, donations are **not** tax-deductible.

Last year Shawn kept busy, and we have been following his humanitarian
adventure. From the relief efforts back in [2007 and
2008](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/01/05/bangladesh-cyclone-sidr-
relief-efforts/), to the [clean water
campaign.](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/10/bangladesh-uncultured-
project-and-clean-water/) Although he has many videos on his site, he doesn't
post with much frequency, and it may be a good thing, even if it [hurts his
YouTube ratings](http://uncultured.com/2010/07/19/why-i-went-to-vidcon/):

> Although I want to, I also can’t make videos on a regular & frequent
> schedule. I’m forced to balance doing a good job on-the-ground with spending
> time making videos.
>
> In some cases, the projects I do take _years_ to complete. They require
> planning, networking, budgets, on-the-ground trust building, and also need
> to account for natural disasters & political unrest which push back
> schedules.

Following, a video of Shawn's appearance at
[VidCon](http://www.vidcon2010.com/), a conference on online video, where he
shared a video with the Audience: [_The Boy who
Lived_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dsjtJMqsE) is a video showing a story
that took 1000 days to tell.

Shawn Ahmed's blog posts are touching, insightful and broad: they touch upon
many different topics related to poverty: from[ Doing good, feeling good and
_Voluntourism_](http://uncultured.com/2010/07/01/charity-to-feel-good-vs-
doing-good/), to the [ethics of nudity in poverty photography,
](http://uncultured.com/2010/06/06/the-ethics-of-nudity-in-poverty-
photography/) while also [making a case
](http://uncultured.com/2010/06/01/weening-charities-off-celebrities/)for
charities to seek beyond the celebrity spokesperson and instead invest in the
average person and their online audiences. Follow and subscribe to [his
YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/UnculturedProject) for a dose of
optimism and a glimpse on how one person can change people's lives, a little
bit at a time.
