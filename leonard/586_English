Ahmadinejad, has just concluded [a two-day visit to
Lebanon](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2010-10/15/c_13559628.htm).
It was his first official since 2005 when he first took office. He held talks
with Lebanese officials and visited strongholds of Iran's ally Hezbollah in
the capital's southern suburbs and south Lebanon, and received a hero's
welcome. Several Iranian bloggers reacted to this trip.

_Meybodema_ has published several photos of Ahmadinejad's visit in Lebanon and
[quoted ](http://meybodema.blogfa.com/post-212.aspx) [fa] Sayyid Hassan
Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, who praised the Islamic Republic and
welcomed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The blogger quotes Nasrallah saying that contrary to all propaganda, “Iran is
helping the oppressed”.

_Sayeh Azadi_ has [republished](http://freedom-
sayeh.blogspot.com/2010/10/blog-post_3849.html) (see above) a cartoon by
leading Iranian cartoonist _Nikahang_ from in
[Roozonline](http://www.roozonline.com/persian/cartoon/cartoon-
item/article/2010/october/13//-93fd232585.html) [fa] with the headline
“Ahmadinejad's dreams for Lebanon”.

_Z8unak_ counts some reasons of why Lebanese people welcomed Ahmadinejad. The
blogger [writes](http://z8unak.blogspot.com/2010/10/blog-post.html) [fa]:

> Why you were surprised that Ahmadinejad was greeted so warmly in Lebanon?
> After 20 years of the Iran-Iraq war, border cities did not get constructed
> but houses in Lebanon were constructed by our money. Many Iranians can not
> afford going to a doctor or hospitals and die every day as a result,
> meanwhile Iran constructs hospitals in Lebanon.

_Mollah_ [writes ](http://mollah.blogspot.com/2010/10/blog-post_13.html)with
irony:

> Lebanese did not see any bad things from the Iranian government. If we were
> Lebanese and got the money we would become Islamic Republic's supporters…
> They say, we don't care that they are in power after a ‘coup’ or that they
> torture people… just pass the dollars.
