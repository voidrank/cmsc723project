As the global demand for soy rises, Paraguay has become the world's fastest-
growing producer of the crop. But with resulting riches have also come battles
over land rights and environmental concerns.

Soybeans are used in the production of food, edible oils and animal feed, as
well as [biofuels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel). The industry has
grown exponentially in recent years, in part because of increased demand for
meat and cattle feed in China and a rising biofuel industry in Europe. Many
South American countries, including Paraguay, have responded to this demand by
boosting soybean production.

in Paraguay (see slideshow below).

Paraguay is the now world's [fourth largest exporter of the
crop](http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/psdReport.aspx?hidReportRetrievalName=Table+07%3a+Soybeans%3a+World+Supply+and+Distribution+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&hidReportRetrievalID=706&hidReportRetrievalTemplateID=8),
trailing the U.S., Brazil and Argentina, and the sixth biggest producer of
soybeans. Earlier this year the country saw a [record soybean
crop](http://www.dtnprogressivefarmer.com/dtnag/view/blog/getBlog.do?blogHandle=southamerica&blogEntryId=8a82c0bc268be2db01278c55bc340ca1).
This growth has come at a price though, creating social disputes and land
rights issues for the country's small-scale farmers, known also as
_campesinos_ , as well as environmental and health concerns.

In the blog of the Brussels office of the German [Rosa Luxemburg
Foundation](http://www.rosalux.de/english/foundation), Edgardo Lander in
Venezuela argues that the recent growth in Latin American trade and
agriculture is “predatory” and that leftist governments [must seek sustainable
alternatives](http://blog.rosalux-europa.info/2010/04/09/leftist-and-
progressive/):

> “Given a rapidly growing international demand and high levels of profit,
> agribusiness has responded with a rapid increase of the extensions of crops
> in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. In addition to the negative
> impacts of monoculture and transgenic crops, the tremendous expansion of the
> soybeans has led to a greater concentration in land tenure and the
> displacement of peasants, affecting the production of other crops such as
> rice, maize, sunflower and wheat. This has also led to a strengthening of
> the economic and political power of the business groups that participate in
> the different stages of production and marketing of the soybeans. This is
> what Syngenta, (one of the main agribusiness corporations), cynically and
> arrogantly, referred to as the United Soya Republic.”

The industry has had particularly adverse effects on Paraguay's small farmers
and indigenous people, many of whom have been forced off their lands.

New York City-based photographer Evan Abramson documented the [social
conflicts generated by industrial soy
production](https://nacla.org/soyparaguay) in some of Paraguay's rural
communities. In a photo essay for _NACLA Report on the Americas_ , he says:

> “The soy boom has been disastrous for small farmers, who, after living for
> years on government-allotted forestland, have begun to be uprooted. In the
> last decade, the Paraguayan government has given away or illegally sold this
> public land to political friends in the soybean business, pushing the
> peasants out. Today, about 77 percent of Paraguayan land is owned by 1
> percent of the population… Since the first soy boom in 1990, almost 100,000
> small-scale farmers have been forced to migrate to urban slums; about 9,000
> rural families are evicted by soy production each year.”

In 2009, photographer Olmo Calvo Rodríguez, a member of the Latin American
photographer's collective [SUB](http://www.sub.coop/), took the photos
featured in the slideshow below. He wrote that the _campesinos_ in the photos
form part of a community of 40 families who were evicted from their land by
the soybean industry 17 times in the past six years, but still have not lost
hope of building their lives there. (The photos are shared under a [Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-

Journalist Charles Lane, in a [series](http://pulitzergateway.org/2008/04/the-
soybean-wars-overview/) supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,
calls this scenario “the soybean wars.” But landless farmers are fighting
back, he says, protesting and even staging armed invasions on the land of
soybean producers, who have themselves also been
[accused](http://www.activistmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=568&Itemid=80)
of resorting to violence.

Many of these farmers had hoped Paraguay's president Lugo would bring them
some relief. Lugo received nearly unanimous support from the _campensinos_
when elected in 2008, but in March of this year thousands of farmers protested
in Asunción to demand Lugo follow through on campaign promises.

Kyle Tana, blogging on the Council on Hemispheric Affairs's Web site, suggests
that [Lugo is caught between two polarized
groups](http://www.coha.org/soybean-wars/)–the _campesino_ movement and
Paraguay's congress:

> “While campaigning, then-Bishop Lugo characterized himself as the “bishop
> for the poor,” and was successful in giving hope to Paraguay’s indigenous
> and disadvantaged communities. However, after two years in office,
> comparatively little has been done to address the promised redistribution of
> land to landless farmers as well as the rising tensions between _campesinos_
> and large monocrop (primarily soy) producers.”

The growing soy industry has also had environmental effects, contributing to
the destruction of rain forests and leading to heavy use of toxic
agrochemicals. In his photo essay, Abramson
[says](https://nacla.org/soyparaguay) that soy cultivators dump more than 6
million gallons of pesticides and herbicides into the Paraguayan soil every
year, including extremely hazardous chemicals, partly due to lax environmental
law enforcement. Some fear that in addition to harming the environment, these
chemicals are harming the health of local residents. To make matters worse, a
post on the blog of the Union of Journalists of Paraguay ( _Sindicato de
Periodistas del Paraguay_ )
[says](http://periodistaspy.blogspot.com/2010/07/nino-que-nacio-con-abdomen-
perforado.html) the press isn't covering deaths or diseases that may be
related to chemical overuse, sanitizing the image of multinationals:

> Este tipo de información negativa que afecta la imagen de los poderosos
> sojeros no son publicados con frecuencia por los grandes medios del
> Paraguay, como ABC Color, que inclusive niega el poder destructivo de los
> “agrotóxicos”. El diario del empresario Aldo Zuccolillo prohibe a sus
> periodistas utilizar este término en caso de que no pueda evitar la
> publicación de una denuncia de intoxicación [(la palabra autorizada por el
> diario es
> “agroquímico”)](http://archivo.abc.com.py/2008-10-01/articulos/455844/los-
> agroquimicos-solo-son-agrotoxicos-en-el-
> paraguay&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&usg=ALkJrhh5L_-
> KW8eZ_w28JCfuUzsoYXJnlA).

This type of negative information that affects the image of the powerful soy
producers are not often published in the mainstream media of Paraguay, like
ABC Color, who even denies the destructive power of “agrotoxins”. The
newspaper of the businessman Aldo Zuccolillo prohibits its journalists from
using the term in cases where it can't avoid publishing a report of
intoxication (the word authorized by the newspaper is “agrochemical”).

Another concern, for people like Alan Raul Banda Huatay in Cancun, Mexico, is
the planting of genetically modified (GM) soy. After watching a film on the
subject, Huatay had this to
[say](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=301990362878&topic=20952#!/topic.php?uid=301990362878&topic=20952)
in a discussion board on Facebook:

> Es lamentable comprobar que lo único que realmente importa es el beneficio
> económico, ni la salud, ni los derechos de los campesinos, todo queda en
> segundo término ante la soja transgénica y no se sopesa el riesgo de los
> alimentos transgénicos. A los campesinos sólo les queda plantar cara e
> intentar frenar el avance del monocultivo…

“It is regrettable to confirm that the only thing that matters is profit, not
health, nor the rights of peasants, everything takes second place to the
transgenic soybean and they do not weigh the risk of genetically modified
food. The peasants are left to stand up and try to stop the advance of
monocultivation…”

Bloggers’ suggested solutions to minimizing these various consequences range
from [eating less
meat](http://suprememastertv.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sos_iphone&wr_id=1573)
to establishing [voluntary standards](http://www.agnetwork.com/Eco-Groups--
Farmers--New-BFFs/2010-07-19/Article.aspx?oid=1165790&fid=AN-LATEST_NEWS) for
eco-friendly soy production, to [alerting
students](http://soybeanwars.blogspot.com/) in China about the issues. A post
on _The Socialist WebZine_
[says](http://www.socialistwebzine.org/2010/07/false-choices-of-food-in-
capitalism.html) the first step, however, is to recognize that we're all in
this together:

> “Digging our way out will necessarily entail creating a movement with the
> ability to link the soy consumer in the north with a Paraguayan farmer or to
> see how yucca, corn, beans and potatoes might produce a far greater benefit
> for the planet than mono-cropping. The politics of the “we” of socialism
> hold far more potential for addressing the dire needs of our planet than the
> “I” of capitalist consumption.”
