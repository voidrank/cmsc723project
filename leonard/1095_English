The October 4th death of Argentine singer [Mercedes
Sosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa), one of the most important
voices in Latin American folk music, was one of the most important news during
the past weekend. The news was covered by all Argentine media, and some cable
news channels transmitted the wake throughout Sunday.

As expected, many blogs wrote about the singer's death. The large majority
published videos or songs, as a way to pay homage. Other wrote short
descriptions about the sadness of the day. For example, in the blog _[La
Cocina Plural [es]](http://entrecolycollechuga.blogspot.com/2009/10/mercedes-
sosa-solo-le-pido-dios.html)_ , Tomy writes:

Your actions, your words, your songs and your voice awoken some social
consciousness… (some remain asleep), we'll always miss you, may you rest in
peace wherever you may be.

Other blogs wrote short summaries of what happened on the day of her death.
The blog _[La Carabina
[es]](http://lacarabina.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/mercedes-sosa-murio-durante-

ever since her death was announced (early in the morning on Sunday), her fans
waited patiently in line for hours in order to gain access to the wake
organized in the Pasos Perdidos Salon of Congress, which is an honor only
reserved for the most important political and cultural figures

The singer's official website received a large number of messages before and
after her death, due to the progressively worsening in her health condition.
Fans also shared their condolences through[ Mercedes Sosa's Facebook page
