While the world’s giants wage their battles in the international arena – first
India vs. China over borders, now Google Vs. China over the internet – far up
in the Himalayas, tiny Bhutan (with a population of 600,000) also took on
China recently, albeit with no alternative other than quiet diplomacy and
tact.

On 14th January Bhutan wrapped up the 19th round of border talks with the
People’s Republic of China. According to the talks the two governments will
meet again to carry out a “[joint field
survey](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=14485)”
of the disputed territories in the north, which comprise 4 areas amounting to
a total of 874 sq km.

A [press release from the Foreign
Ministry](http://kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=14485)
after the talks stated that both the governments will resolve the boundary
issue through mutual consultation according to the basis of previous
agreements in 1988 and 1998. They will also refrain from taking any unilateral
action and maintain status quo on the boundary. The press release also stated
that the talks were held in a “cordial and most friendly manner.”

But the Chinese Government’s actions on Bhutan’s northern borders have hardly
been ‘cordial’ or ‘most friendly’. Between
[2008](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=14160)
and
[2009](http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?article=Bhutan+reports+17+border+intrusions+by+China+in+2009&id=26178)
several border intrusions by Chinese soldiers deep inside Bhutanese territory
were reported.

Not only that, the [Chinese soldiers had also started constructing roads
leading right into Bhutanese
territory.](http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=14160)
It took several protests from the Bhutanese government's side and many
discussions at the State level for the Chinese to stop the road constructions.

It seems like the sentiment among Bhutanese officials when it comes to China
is to tread carefully with the giant. After all, Bhutan is the last country
that can afford to stir its ire. The official stand, therefore, has always
been to say that the discussions were [“meaningful,
productive,”](http://www.bbs.com.bt/Bhutan-
China%20boundary%20talks%20concludes.html) despite what happened.

Perhaps it is for this very reason that most Bhutanese writers and bloggers
have been silent on this issue, but
[Bhutantimes.com](https://www.bhutantimes.com/modules/headlines), a site where
many Bhutanese interact – anonymously or under pseudonyms – to voice their
dissent, seemed to ask some questions: [“Is China really taking away Bhutan’s
land
silently?”](https://www.bhutantimes.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3180&forum=10)

On that thread a commentator named Farmer said:

_Tamerlane_ , a non-Bhutanese blogger, [pointed
out](http://karakullake.blogspot.com/2009/12/china-bhutan-border-dispute.html)
why the Chinese were interested in claiming these border regions:

> “The region at issue is important geopolitically because it is so close to
> India's Chicken's Neck, or Siliguri Corridor. It was created when East
> Pakistan (Bangladesh) and West Pakistan separated from India. Its purpose is
> to provide India with a narrow path to reach its faraway northeastern
> states. The area is also used by smugglers from Bangladesh and as a refuge
> for Maoist Nepalese rebels.
>
> China has every desire to stir up instability here, as it will inevitably
> result in the weakening of India. Much of India's army is on the western
> front defending Kashmir, so China has almost free reign on the eastern
> front. PLA troops are entering Bhutan. Roads and bridges are being built
> inside Bhutan (allegedly).”

India, meanwhile, has been keeping a close tab on developments. _Dr. S.
Chandrasekharan_ , Director of South Asia Analysis Group (SAAG) in New Delhi
[wrote about](http://www.c3sindia.org/bhutan/1149) the developments at the
site of the Chennai Centre for China Studies:

> “There are two views in India on the border problems between Bhutan and

> border dispute between India and China is resolved. The other view is that
> once Bhutan is weaned away from India, the Chinese will probably be more

> In the near future while major clashes may not occur between the PLA and
> RBA, China will continue to tease and bully Bhutan and its border outpost

Throughout its history Bhutan had trade relations with Tibet, pre-Chinese
occupation. But after 1960 Bhutan sealed all its northern borders. Today
Bhutan has [no diplomatic relations with China but according to the assistant
minister of the ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hu
Zhengyue,](http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/2010/bhutan-news/01/boundary-talks-
curtain-raiser.html) “the two countries have been friendly neighbors since
history.”

But just how friendly these neighbors are, is yet to be seen as the border
issues remain unresolved and talks continue. Last year in March, when
[Canadian researchers uncovered a vast spy system that looted information from
computers in 103
countries](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/technology/29spy.html?_r=1)
(including those of the Dalai Lama) Bhutan’s Foreign Ministry was also on that
list.
