The events that took place during the Egyptian revolution have been well
documented in the mainstream media, as well as [citizen
media](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/egypt-protests-2011/),
where the eyes of the entire world focused on the developments that led to the
resignation of the president, Hosni Mubarak on February 11, 2011. Even the
bloggers and coordinators from the various Rising Voices projects in Egypt
contributed to the narration of events from [their own personal
experience](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2011/03/07/egypt-
looking-back-at-the-jan25-revolution/).

However, in the months following the historic popular uprising, much of the
globe's attention has turned elsewhere with
[similar](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/libya-
uprising-2011/)[
protests](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/cote-divoire-
unrest-2011/) taking place, as well as the aftermath of [natural
disasters](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/). Yet, many Egyptian bloggers have continued to write about the
ongoing challenges facing this time of transition.

Many Egyptians continue to promote the expansion of rights for women in post-
Mubarak Egypt. One participant in the [Exploring
Taboos](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/grantees/nazra-for-feminist-
studies/) project wrote about his participation in the Million Woman March
that was held on March 8, 2011, and which [attracted rival protests
](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/08/rival-protesters-clash-women-
tahrir)and [harassment from those that did not agree with the demands [video,

Ahmed Awadalla of the blog _[Rebel with a Cause](http://rwac-
egypt.blogspot.com)_ participated side-by-side with women who attended the
march. He describes the event from the perspective of “a male who went there
to support women’s rally for freedom and democracy.” He assisted by
distributing flyers that contained some of the demands that included
significant female participation in shaping the country's constitutional,
legal, and political future, as well as ensuring full equality and rights for
women. The protest also called for the establishment of a law that would
criminalize violence against women inside and outside the home, among other
demands. When others saw the flyer and those who were marching calling for
demands, he describes their reaction in this [blog post](http://rwac-
egypt.blogspot.com/2011/03/faggots-for-whores-or-what-happened-to.html):

> We started chanting for women rights. Just as we started chanting a group of

> We tried to chant back singing the national anthem and saying “Men and women

He described some of the arguments that were used against the protestors,
including the claim that these demands are ill-timed based on what others
believe are more pressing needs. However, Awadalla is unapologetic, writing
that these rights cannot wait, and that this won't be the last time that he
stands up for his beliefs.
