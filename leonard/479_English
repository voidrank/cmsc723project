For a Navajo community, video has become a way to connect youth with their
ancestors and the history of their people through the story of the Yellow
Woman.

[Waves of
Change](http://deepdishwavesofchange.blogspot.com/2010/12/intergeneration-
indigenous-project.html) tells us about Rachel Tso, who through her work with[
Outta Your Backpack Media](http://oybm.org/about-2/) has trained indigenous
youth in movie making and media distribution. In this particular example, it
led to Camille Manybeads Tso producing the story of her great grandmother and
making the award winning youth film: _[In the Footsteps of Yellow
Woman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_T5cyRKuRc)_.

The process of making the movie has been documented by Rachel on 2 videos
showing the different steps taken to make this place based media assignment
that is also her thesis.

[Outta Your Backpack Media](http://oybm.org) helps indigenous youth to produce
and distribute media relevant to their interests and reflecting their concerns
and their voices. You can watch more of their videos on the _Outta Your
Backpack_ [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/outtayourbackpack).
