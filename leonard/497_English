Severe [winter
storms](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3998174,00.html) hit most of
Israel this week with strong winds, rain and snowstorms causing country-wide
havoc. In the North, the Hermon Mountain was blanketed with more snow than the
country has seen in 20 years. This happened days after the Carmel region was
devastated by forest fires which left [43
dead](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3997434,00.html) and caused
damage estimated at between [100-120 million
Shekels](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141081?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter).

For many, these storms provide welcome relief from the drought the country has
been experiencing. The Sea of Galilee, Israel’s main water reservoir, has
risen [five centimetres ](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/winter-storms-
snow-in-jerusalem-and-a-boon-for-the-kinneret-1.330350)as a result of the
storms.

This sentiment is echoed by many in the Israeli twitosphere.

Despite the havoc, disruption and inconvenience caused many were simply
grateful for the rain.

> Snow and rain in #Israel! God is answering our prayers!

But these storms weren't the answer to everyone's prayers. Although in
desperate need of rain, the storms also caused [country-wide
damage](http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?ID=199130&R=R1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter).

[The Maoz Israel blog](http://maozisraelblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/breaking-
news-from-fires-to-floods-in.html) published some pictures of the destruction
caused by the storms:

Tel Aviv's beach battered by gale force winds and heavy storms

[Alone in Holy Land](http://aloneinholyland.blogspot.com/2010/12/sand-storms-
and-fears-andalls-well-when.html), a Romanian blogger living in Ashdod,
described what it was like to get caught in the storm while driving with her
family to Eilat:

> In was absolutely hellish! First, it was the wind, very strong and then the
> sand…When we reached Mitzpe Ramon it was so cold and windy … I was
> terrified. The gales of wind kept hitting the car from one side, then the
> other and I was panic stricken. Not even able to utter one word. My stomach
> was the size of a pea and the throat constricted… Unbelievable…while I was
> muttering prayers under my breath and pretending I was somewhere else. At
> the end of our trip, some 30 km before Eilat, the sand storm stopped
> abruptly, the sky became clear and the sun was back on the sky.

And then there were those who threw caution to the wind and took advantage of
the stormy conditions. Shahar Zubari, an Israeli windsurfer, braved the
weather and headed for the waves.
