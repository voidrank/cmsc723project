[From May 12 (12M) to May 15
(15M)](https://es.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/05/12/espana-iniciativas-sobre-
el-15m-un-ano-despues/) [es], Spain has experienced a social movement in the
streets to protest the control of the banks and demand a system that is more
democratic, participatory, and fair. With the expansion of demonstrations and
general discontent, the 15M movement achieved its goal of growing and
remaining in the street.

Citizen collectives continue to act through popular assemblies, commissions,
and work groups that allow for debate on topics that affect the people and
carry out acts of cooperation. Many countries have been inspired by the
“indignant” Spaniards, and protests continued to demonstrate their global
character on October 15 of last year, with demonstrations in over 900 cities
and 82 countries. On May 12, 2012, demonstrations were organized once again
throughout all of Spain and on a global level.

The arts have also blossomed with the 15M. Blog [Voces con
Futura](http://vocesconfutura.tumblr.com/) [es] _(Voices with a Future)_
publishes a large portion of the anonymous posters that have filled the plazas
during the protests. The author of the blog is a Spanish designer residing
abroad that wants to maintain her anonymity and dedicates her attention to the
creative talent that has risen as a result of the indignant movement.

To commemorate the 15M's first anniversary, the 12M–15M events, and to invite
everyone to take to the streets again, the blog [#
Acampadasol](http://madrid.tomalaplaza.net/) [es] has published a series of
amazing posters that reveal many of the reasons for the protests. Here we
share some of the beautiful and creative posters:
