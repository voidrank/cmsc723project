On November 23, 2009 the incumbent President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa
announced that the next [presidential election in Sri
Lanka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_presidential_election,_2010)
will be held on January 26, 2010. According to analysts he is seeking a fresh
mandate prior to the expiration of his first term in 2011 riding on his
immense popularity after defeating the Tamil Tigers in 2009. To counter
Rajapaksa's favorable position, the main opposition party in Sri Lanka (UNP)
has formed an alliance (United National Front) to contest at the presidential
elections and [nominated ex chief of Army General Sarath
Fonseka](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/11/12/sri-lanka-the-general-
resigns/) as their candidate. Fonseka is revered for spearheading the total
annihilation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) and the Tamil
liberation struggle. Although there are [23 candidates competing in the
election](http://topgelato.com/2010-sri-lanka-presidential-
election-23-candidates-announced-by-sri-lanka-election-commissioner/12183),
the battle between Mahinda Rajapaksa and Sarath Fonseka is the prime focus.

As the date of election approaches, the campaigns have grown intense and the
heat can be felt also in the Sri Lankan blogosphere. Many bloggers are
rallying behind their candidates and are engaging in strong debates with
analysis and points-counterpoints.

[Mawbima Sri Lanka](http://www.mawbimasrilanka.com/2010/01/mahinda-promises-
brighter-future-for.html) writes about Mahinda Rajapaksa's manifesto:

> President Mahinda Rajapaksa unveiled a 14-point programme titled, ‘A
> brighter future’ with a promise to bring Sri Lanka to a prominent position
> in Asia and the world and work towards a political solution to the ethnic
> problem.

_Groundviews_ tried to visualize the promises by [Sarath Fonseka detailed in
his manifesto](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/08/visualising-sarath-
fonsekas-key-campaign-issues-and-manifesto/ ) which seems to call upon voters
to look forward and build a better future together. _Kusal Perera_ at
_Groundviews_ analyzes [Sarath Fonseka's
manifesto:](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/11/%E2%80%9Cbelievable-

We have also seen some intense reactions from bloggers. _Lanka Rising_
[asserts](http://www.lankarising.com/2010/01/liar-liar-pants-on-fire.html)
that the theme of Sarath Fonseka’s election campaign is nothing but ‘lying’.
On the other hand, _Lanka Polity_
[accuses](http://lankapolity.blogspot.com/2010/01/blatant-misuse-of-public-
property-in.html) Mahinda Rajapkasa of blatant misuse of public property and
tax money in his campaigns. _Mahinda_ was criticized for [sending unsolicited
sms messages](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/01/unsolicited-sms-messages-
are-spam-please-desist-mr-president/ ) to all mobile phone subscribers, across
all networks in Sri Lanka. _Sanjana Hattotuwa_ at _Groundviews_ questions
[Mahinda's ad campaign on international media
websites](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/05/paying-global-media-for-local-
elections) and writes an [open letter to the president
asking](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/10/a-letter-to-the-president-on-
his-re-election-campaign-spending/):

> Why is it that your official campaign website has no information on campaign
> financing? How can I be assured as a voter that the money being lavishly
> spent by you and your campaign for re-election is not public finances?

_Going Global_ looks at [the campaign
trail](http://abdulhalik.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/on-the-campaign-jungle-
trail/):

> Propaganda is usually illegal and mostly sponsored through dubious means. In
> the case of Mahinda, he is dictating the terms here. He controls the state
> and arguably the legal system. He is setting the rules in a game that
> Fonseka is not equipped to play in. When it comes to campaigning its a
> jungle out there and the fittest survive. And given the conditions of play
> it is no surprise who is gaining the upper hand.

Sri Lanka's liberal democrat blogger _Lefroy_
[says](http://lefroy.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/whose-ad-campaign-is-winning/):

> So who’s ad campaign is better? hmm. Hard to say. Mahinda’s probably
> slightly ahead. But Sarath has done quite well with far less money and no
> state power.

_Dayapala Thiranagama_ at _Groundviews_
[discusses](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/14/reflections-on-the-
underlying-issues-that-determine-the-outcome-of-the-election-who-has-got-the-
edge/ ) which of the candidates has got the edge:

> It appears that the election is reshaping the political forces that existed
> before the war. It is also bringing to the fore the old political problems.
> This election finds Sri Lanka standing at a crossroad. It is an indictment
> of our political parties that following the defeat of the Tigers and the
> opportunity to win the peace, all that is on offer to the voter is a choice
> between the anti democratic histories and repressive nature of the competing
> parties. At stake is nothing less than the future of our fragile democracy.

_Lanka Polity_ [says that](http://lankapolity.blogspot.com/2010/01/sri-lankan-
tamils-between-devil-and.html) the Tamils are in dilemma and may have to
choose between the lesser of the evils.

_The Abyss_ [asserts](http://saintfallen.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/why-dont-
you-vote/) that irrespective of the prevailing conditions the vote matters:

> So what if both candidates have downsides, it doesn’t mean it would be wrong
> for you to decide between them. Regardless of what you do or don’t do, you
> do make a difference, more than you know. You’re acting by not acting,
> you’re choosing without making a choice, you’re voting someone in by not
> voting.

_Jude Fernando_ at _Groundviews_ [sees some hope in this
election](http://www.groundviews.org/2010/01/14/from-politics-of-fear-to-
politics-of-hope/#more-2479):

> Whether or not Fonseka can win, if we work to increase the number of votes
> he receives, we can hope for a stronger opposition in the future, and we can
> successfully expand the space for democracy. We can make it more likely that
> one day we will be able to hold the ruling party accountable, and we can
> exert pressure to make the next general election much more just and fair.
> This is the way I suggest that we approach this election. By struggling to
> build the opposition, even behind a less than optimal candidate, we can
> avoid the trap of cynicism and the mire of hopelessness.
