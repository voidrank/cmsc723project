[Information and communications technology
(ICT)](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology) has
long been hailed as a harbinger of a global change. Researchers have argued
over the potential of ICT, specifically in promoting literacy and raising
social awareness. A number of projects around the globe have made a mark while
trying to utilize ICT towards such ends proving ICT could be of immense
significance in our world.

[Gawaahi](http://gawaahi.org/) is one such venture that aims to bring to fore
underrepresented voices of Pakistani society. Coupling ICT with social
activism, Gawaahi was started off by two eminent Pakistani social activists,
[Naveen Naqvi](http://naveenaqvi.com/) and [Sana
Saleem](http://www.sanasaleem.com). It is basically an online archive of
videos and digital stories that aims to promote ‘the other story’, issues that
don’t usually make it to the mainstream media or are underreported.

Speaking about what Gawaahi highlights, Naveen
[says](http://www.audiencescapes.org/resources/field-blog/gawaahi-Pakistan-
citizen-journalism-Naveen-Naqvi):

> We want to share people's stories. Kids off the streets of Karachi. A
> peasant farmer from Qambar Shahdad Kot. A young woman who was molested at
> the age of eight and has survived to share the tale with us as a young
> woman. An acid survivor from the interior of Punjab. A woman displaced
> because of a landslide in the Hunza valley. These are the stories you will
> find on Gawaahi.

What started off as a small venture in 2011 has turned into a well-known
online phenomenon in Pakistan’s online media. Not only has the project had a
national impact, it has also made headlines in the international social media.
Within two months of the launch, Gawaahi was nominated for the Best Social
Activism Campaign and Best English Blog categories of the prestigious[
Deutsche Welle Blog Awards](http://www.thebobs.com/).

What can be called a truly unique aspect of the portal is its inclusion of
digital stories. Digital story-telling has been around for long but is still
struggling to find its way into the Pakistani blogosphere. The Gawaahi team
has brought this facet of online activism to fore by narrating a number of
stories digitally. To this, much has been contributed by [Mehreen
Kasana](http://www.mehreenkasana.wordpress.com), an active blogger and an
activist who is known for her awesome doodles. On the home page of it’s
[YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Gawaahi), a digital story
narrates how a girl was molested for many years by her dad’s friend until she
decided to speak up.

The presentation of the story and the aesthetics are captivating. [Gawaahi’s
YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Gawaahi) also hosts dozens of
videos: these are stories of abused women, tutorials on how to use cameras, as
well as interviews with national and international bloggers and journalists
about the significance of social activism, especially in the online world.

Today, Gawaahi is a registered NGO. The official website states that it “plans
to produce video testimonies of abuse and survival for awareness and advocacy
campaigns.” Talking about the possible significance of the portal, Naveen
[says](http://tribune.com.pk/story/122299/pushing-barriers/):

> We’re hoping it will be a useful resource for donor agencies, NGOs, media
> houses, governments including ours, donor states and philanthropist
> organizations.
