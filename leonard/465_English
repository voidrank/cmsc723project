Devastating floods on both the East and West coasts of Australia have caused a
war of words over water as well as some high quality online crowdsourcing by
our national broadcaster.

First, a telling graphic to bring on the blues, from the BOM (Bureau of
Meteorology) about December 2010 rainfall across the continent. Thanks to

Moments](http://christopherjoye.blogspot.com/2011/01/cbas-flood-maps.html)_

The _ABC_ (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) has gathered lots of data from
the field. There has been a series of online spaces to share flood
experiences, including the **ABC[Qld Flood Crisis
Map](http://queenslandfloods.crowdmap.com/) – Mapping reports for Queensland
floods**
([#qldfloodsmap](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23qldfloodsmap)). The
latest has user-generated recovery stories, at **After the Deluge**
([#afterthedeluge](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23afterthedeluge)):

A sample from Anne and Bruce on 7 January 2011:

Tigtog has a reptilian take on flood hazards at _Hoyden About Town_ :

> Queenslanders are having to watch out for poisonous snakes who also want a

At _En Passant_ John has a more global perspective on his weekly ‘Saturday’s
socialist speak out':

> Are the floods a consequence of climate change and global warming? The wild
> and fluctuating weather – flooding, fire, heatwaves and cold snaps across
> the globe and in Australia – certainly back the argument of many scientists
> (including the CSIRO) that global warming will lead to extreme weather
> events and that such events will happen on a regular basis.

> The floods in Queensland and Western Australia fit into that analysis.

Melissa Sweet, of Crikey’s _Croakey Health Blog_ , has similar climate change
concerns in her quick search of the medical implications of floods around the
world. Snake bites aren’t her only worry:

> One of the recurring themes from relevant articles seems to be the lack of
> evidence in this area, especially about the longer-term health impacts and
> how to prevent/manage them. Yet flooding is among the most common types of
> natural disasters and is predicted to become more frequent and intense as a
> result of climate change.

Party politics have also surfaced with Opposition leader Tony Abbott pushing
the unfashionable [dams option](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-
affairs/tony-abbotts-dam-solution-for-flooded-rivers/story-
fn59niix-1225983272814). There is plenty of blogosphere opposition to his
response. Peter at _Fact Fiction and Photography_ , ‘Australian political
commentary’, prefers the Prime Minister’s take:

> Needless to say Julia Gillard has poured scorn on the idea. Quite correctly
> she points out that there is no evidence at all that a couple of dams here
> or there would have made any difference to the flooding.

This is support for investigating dams from parrabuddy at _Skippy Aus_ :

Economics is also a talking point. Along with speculation about a fall in GDP
and rises in world coal prices, locals affected by the inundations are
lobbying for more government aid. Harry Clarke’s _On economics, politics &
other things_ is far from sympathetic:

> Flooded farmers in WA who have received $15,000 from the Federal Government

> [they are outraged because they believe flooded Queenslanders are getting

The floods are [far from
finished](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/08/3108855.htm) yet, much
less the cleanup or the arguments. Many rural voters have been reluctant to
accept global warming as a cause of extreme weather events. They may well find
it more difficult to get financial compensation from the public purse in
future decades.

It is less than two years ago that my post shouted [Australia: Bushfires
devastate Victoria](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/02/09/australia-
bushfires-devastate-victoria/) as the worst drought in living memory gripped
the nation.
