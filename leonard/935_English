2009 is coming to an end. It was, and still is, [a tumultuous
year](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/madagascar-power-
struggle-2009/) for Madagascar. The following article, which covers January to
April, is the first of a three-part summary of the events that marked 2009,
from the perspective of citizens who lived through the turmoil.

**January:**

As people started to protest in the streets of Antananarivo, many citizens
quickly became aware that the looming political crisis was taking an unusual
turn, as [prison breaks were
occurring](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/09/madagascar-prison-breaks-
as-life-imitates-television/) all around the country:

_Jentilisa_ wondered about [the cause of such unusual
events](http://jentilisa.blaogy.com/post/122/5815) (mg):

> Heverina ho misy ny atidoha nikotrika ny raharaha ary olona ivelan'ny
> voafonja ny atidoha, satria tsy tokony hanana finday na fitaovan-tserasera
> hafa ireo voafonja ireo handosirana tao  
>  anatin'ny indray alina. Tarataratra ho fitadiavana hanakorontanana ny
> firenena amin'ny alalan'ny tsy filaminana no tanjona na fanindriana ankolaka
> ny olona tsy hihetsika satria hanampy isa ireo olona natao hanakorontana
> fotsiny (A qui profite le crime?). Hisy raharaha ity volana Janoary sy ny
> tohiny ity izany koa!

One has to suspect there had to be a mastermind behind this affair, a
mastermind from outside, because the inmates could not possibly get all those
“tools” in one night. Is this all about trying to disturb the public order or
is it to prevent people from making a move because they will be accused of
disturbing the public order ( who benefits most from the crime?). It sure will
be quite an interesting month of January !

January turned out to be [a deadly
month](https://globalvoicesonline.org/index.php?cat=122&m=200901). [Twitterers
in Madagascar](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/26/live-reports-from-
madagascars-twittosphere-antananarivo-on-fire-rumors-president-is-leaving-the-
country/) spread news of Black Monday, the day [security forces vanished and
various incidents of arson and looting took place in the capital
city](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/27/madagascar-history-repeats-
itselfas-a-farce-in-recent-unrest/), resulting in dozens of casualties. Jean,
a member of a Yahoo! forum,
[asked](http://fr.groups.yahoo.com/group/serasera/message/31041):

> “Ny fanontaniana mipetraka sy tonga ho azy dia ny hoe inona moa no

The question we are now naturally asking is the difference between the current
destruction and the destruction of things in 2002?… What is the solution so
that looting and destruction like these never happen again?

**February:**

February 7th, remembered as “Red Saturday”, claimed the lives of at least 80
protesters, among them Ando Ratovonirina, a 26 year old cameraman for the
television station RTA.

_Barijoana_ , one of the very first Malagasy bloggers, [was a witness to the
scene and
wrote](http://homepage.mac.com/barijaona/madagascar/cr7fevrier2009.html) (fr):

“I was convinced that all had been negotiated in advance, that the crowd would
remain at a polite distance, that only a small delegation would enter inside
the gates of the palace, and that this delegation would then ask the crowd to
disperse. I was too far away to see what happened in the crowd before the
security barrier was gave way. If one of the mass protest managers had led the
crowd to believe that they could go in, his responsibility is enormous. I can
only talk about what I have seen and heard, but I found it astonishing that
both Andry Rajoelina and Monja Roindefo stayed away from the delegations
negotiating their entry past the gates of the palace.”

It should be noted that the HAT (transitional government) promised a thorough
investigation of the events that resulted in several deaths on January 26th
and February 7th. To date, however, no official reports or conclusions have
been made public, adding confusion to the contradicting testimonies from
different sides.

**March:**

The crisis deepened as public protests dwindled, replaced by a rift in the
armed forces. _Ariniana_ posted on [her twitter
feed](http://twitter.com/ariniaina/status/1269619207):

_Tahina_ [illustrated vividly the climate of fear and mistrust that overcame
everyone](http://r1lita.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/will-this-lead-to-a-civil-
war/):

> It’s no longer safe to talk politics in public areas (buses included)

On March 17th, Andry Rajoelina, former mayor of Antananarivo and current
president of the transition, seized power after a handover from the army.
Understandably, opinions were divided on the coup d’etat and its future
outcome. _Madagate_ was [satisfied that Ravaloamana was removed from
power](http://madagate.com/analyse/951-ravalomanana-enfin-out-place-au-
president-de-la-hat-andry-rajoelina-.html) (fr):

Marc Ravalomanana, the little milkman from Imerikasinina, was rejected by the
very ones he gave power to. They did not want to sell their soul to the devil.
The deed is done for this president who showed his real face. When you play
with fire and idols, you get burnt. It was truly the victory of light over
darkness.

Hery believed–rather accurately–that [peace would not soon come to
Madagascar](http://hery.blaogy.com/post/4/6195), despite the change of regime:

> Tsy resy lahatra aho amin'ny hilaminan'ny politika ao Madagasikara ao

Politics will not stop erupting in Madagascar for the next 2 years if
Rajoelina takes power [..] Fighting [those in] power is different from
governing the country.

**April:**

A video of a lone protester named Razily marching towards armed forces hurling
tear gas became an internet sensation in Madagascar and was seen by many as
the symbol of the fight against military repression:

The second part of this review will highlight bloggers’ posts from May to
December 2009. In the meantime, please read Tahina's compelling testimony of
the[ toll the crisis took on the life of one of his
relatives](http://r1lita.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/shit-happens/). Here is an
excerpt:

Continuing reading about 2009 in Madagascar with [Mialy Andriamananjara's
summary of May to November](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/03/the-
year-that-was-in-madagascar-part-ii/), which saw more protests, the boycott of
Andry Rajoelina at the UN, the strength of Malagasy citizen media, and a
devastating toxic spill.
