May 3 has been declared [World Press Freedom
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day) by the United
Nations, in order to raise awareness of the importance of media freedom around
the globe.

As in many other countries, in Ukraine on this day journalists traditionally
announce the results of an anti-rating “Enemies of the Free Press.” This year,
the Institute for Mass Information and the Ukrainian Independent Media Trade
Union have included the Ukrainian President [Victor
Yanukovych](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych) and Prime Minister
[Mykola Azarov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Azarov) at the top of the
“black list.” Among [the
incidents](http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/16800782.html) [uk]
that prompted the inclusion of President Yanukovych on the list were the
disappearance of criticism of the regime from the “1+1” TV channel's story on
his 100 days in office, a ban on photographing the presidential motorcade by
journalists of _Vechirni Visti_ newspaper, and reporters not being allowed to
ask questions during his joint press conference with the Russian President
[Dmitry Medvedev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev).

World Press Freedom Day has also provoked many online discussions about the
state of the media in Ukraine and the possible reasons behind the shrinking of
press freedom in the country.

On his blog on _Ukrayinska Pravda_ , journalist Serhiy Leshchenko
[wrote](http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/leschenko/4dbf7b76eefbb/) [uk]
about the difference between Ukraine’s official Journalist Day and World Press
Freedom Day:

> An [artificial] holiday – Journalist Day – exists in Ukraine, and is
> celebrated on June 6. This holiday has been initiated by state officials and
> declared by the Presidential decree. […] It is especially cynical, how ahead
> of the official June 6 Journalist Day different MPs and state officials
> attempt to greet editorial offices with their “professional holiday.” A
> culmination of such absurdity is a picture of the government awarding
> various honors to loyal media representatives for their “merit.”
>
> It can be compared to, let’s say, a butcher greeting a cow on a Beef Day.
>
> The real Journalist Day around the normal world is May 3 – World Press
> Freedom Day. It is a day when journalists do not celebrate anything, but
> remember their murdered colleagues, politicians who interfere with their
> work, and governments that institute censorship.

Zoryana Byndas, the executive editor of an Internet newspaper _Pohlyad_ ,
[shared](http://poglyad.te.ua/2011/05/u-den-svobody-presy-bazhayu-svobody-vid-
presy/) [uk] her experience with skeptical attitudes toward press freedom that
prevail in the Ukrainian media industry:

> I have recently attended a meeting with a potential advertiser. We discussed
> his services and how they could be best presented to our readers, clarifying
> details. At the end of the meeting, this man asked me about the owner of the
> Internet newspaper _Pohlyad_. I responded that everything was stated on our
> website. Potential advertiser smirked and said, “Well, alright, you are in
> charge there, but whose property is it, who funds you, what political
> party.” I explained again. The man started getting nervous and told me how
> this newspaper was funded by this guy, who also owned a TV channel. And how
> that newspaper kept covering activities of a certain party, which meant it
> owned the outlet. The man was convinced that a small group of enthusiasts,
> like my friends and I, would not run an Internet newspaper, since such
> outlets were only created to [elevate some and discredit others in the
> public eyes].
>
> “Well,” I thought to myself, “the man is right.” Independent press today is
> [unprecedented]. Even if it still exists somewhere, one is tempted to ask,
> What’s the catch?

On the Ukrainian political social network _Politiko.ua_ , user Serhiy
Trehubenko [criticized](http://politiko.ua/blogpost60155) [uk] the Ukrainian
media, stating that press freedom itself was not enough for Ukraine:

> Ukrainian press carries on the functions of the Soviet press – on paper, it
> supports development, but the outcomes demonstrate that it is worse than the
> communist plague.
>
> In civilized countries some things are granted, but in post-Soviet states
> they have to be discussed. Freedom of the press is not enough for us, we
> also need to create an intelligent and responsible press that would be able
> to explain things as they are and suggest ways for improvement.

On _Vikna.if.ua_ , blogger Viktoriya Yadoshchuk
[wrote](http://www.vikna.if.ua/blog/authors/yadvicky/862/6702/) [uk] about why
World Press Freedom Day cannot be dismissed as a simple formality in Ukraine:

> Of course, since the [Orange
> Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution), the Ukrainian
> society has democratized because of the press. But it is not enough because
> the full freedom of expression in Ukraine [has not been achieved]. Moreover,
> since [President] Yanukovych came to power, according to the watchdog
> Freedom House, freedom of expression has actually declined. […]
>
> As we can see, the situation is critical: Ukrainians are once again afraid
> to speak the truth, because of fear for the lives. I think the society
> itself must address this problem. If the nation unites in speaking the
> truth, it would shake up the government and prompt them to [reconsider their
> actions]. Let’s put fear and doubts aside, let’s stay honest and not allow
> those in power to destroy the biggest value – freedom, freedom of choice,
> freedom of thought, and freedom of expression!

Ahead of the World Press Freedom Day, [Freedom
House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House) released a report
[highlighting](http://ukranews.com/ru/news/ukraine/2011/05/02/42691) [ru] the
continuous decline of press freedom in Ukraine – a piece of news that has been
shared extensively by Ukrainian bloggers and Twitterers. Earlier this year,
the organization also
[lowered](http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=594) [en] Ukraine’s
freedom rating from “free” to “partly free.”
