Desertification might sound similar to desert, but there is a fundamental
difference between the two: while deserts are one of nature’s wonderful
formations, desertification is a process of degradation that lands go through
after they are affected by climate change, human activities, and natural
forces until they eventually become deserts.

Although the influence of climate change on desertification has not been fully
understood yet, according to GreenFacts, it is known that [higher temperatures
resulting from increased carbon dioxide levels can have a negative impact
through increased loss of water from soil and reduced rainfall in
drylands](http://www.greenfacts.org/en/desertification/index.htm). At the same
time desertification contributes to climate change by releasing to the
atmosphere carbon stored in dryland vegetation and soils.

Desertification is taking its toll worldwide. At this moment it’s destroying
harvests, driving up the price of remaining food, and in some areas, animals
are dying. People are also being driven away from their homes, as blogger
Miguel Angel Alvarado from El Salvador [explains about the president’s home
needing to be moved because of desertification
[es]](http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/61308/):

> El traslado de casa presidencial, del Barrio san Jacinto al local en donde
> estaba el Ministerio de Relaciones exteriores, según informes
> extrajudiciales, obedece a la prevención del ejecutivo ante un posible
> hundimiento del suelo generado por cárcavas en este sector.

According to non-judicial documents, the relocation of the presidential home
from the San Jacinto neighborhood to the area where the Foreign Affairs
ministry used to be, was a preventive measure made by the executive branch to
avoid a possible sink of the ground as a consequence to the grooves formed
there.

The most affected continent is Africa, and this can be seen especially in
Kenya, where one of the most susceptible sectors to the effects of
desertification and drought are young girls. When the water storage tanks have
been used up at Dago Dala Hera orphanage in western Kenya, volunteer mothers
and children have to draw unclean water from a nearby river for cooking and
drinking. [“Going to the river alone late in the evening is making girls more
vulnerable to men who can sexually abuse
them,”](http://us.oneworld.net/article/367320-africa-famine-deepens-drought-
worst-decades) said Edwin Odoyo, whose mother Pamela founded the orphanage.

Even though desertification has its greatest impact in Africa, Latin America’s
environmental conditions are also undergoing significant transformations, as
discussed recently in the Ninth session of the Conference to the United
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Italian expert Massimo Candelori, representative of the Convention to Combat
Desertification, [said in an interview with
Tierramerica](http://www.tierramerica.info/nota.php?lang=esp&idnews=3422) that
the situation in Latin America is worrisome considering that there is not
enough information about desertification’s scope in the region. “We have no
current data. One of the goals discussed during the ninth session was to get
indicators that allow us to better understand the situation….the last data we
have is from ten years ago” said Candelori.

In Latin American countries where farming and cattle are one of the main
sectors of the economy, desertification can be a silent, but dreadful
predator. At least [25 percent of the regional territory
](http://www.tierramerica.info/nota.php?lang=eng&idnews=3207)is already
degraded and the population is increasingly becoming concerned about this, as
it is reflected in various blogs.

_Eco Briefings [pt]_ , a Brazilian blog, points out that [Brazilians in the
Northeastern region are witnessing an alarming expansion of
desertification[pt]:](http://ecobriefings.com/2009/10/05/desertificao/)

> Mais um alerta está ligado. Temos pouco tempo para corrigir as coisas. (…)
>
> No Brasil a desertificação tem avançado na caatinga, e zonas do polígono da
> seca no Nordeste e Norte de Minas Gerais, e também em Estados que antes não
> tinham áreas secas ou desertificadas como o Rio Grande do Sul. O Rio

Another alarm is on. We have little time to set things right (…)

In Brazil, desertification has increased in the Caatinga, in the zones of
droughts in the Northeast and North of the state of Minas Gerais, as well as
in the states that didn’t suffer of droughts nor desertification before like
in Rio Grande do Sul. The Amazon River has been through a major drought just a
little time ago, with a large amount of fish dying because of this.

Argentina has several areas affected as well. In the region of Valles Aridos,
in the Northeast, where the main economic activity is sheep raising, it is
stipulated that [during the last 100 years at least 180 thousand people had to
emigrate [es] (.pdf
format)](www.inta.gov.ar/salta/info/documentos/Desertificación.pdf ). Southern
Argentina has not escaped desertification either. Blogger Ailen Romero,
comments on the blog _Geoperspectivas [es]_ [that in the Patagonia region, the
government actions to combat desertification are not
enough](http://geoperspectivas.blogspot.com/2009/06/dia-mundial-de-la-
desertificacion-2009.html):

> En la Patagonia, la amplitud del problema es de tal magnitud que ha

In Patagonia, the magnitude of the problem is so wide to the point that the
general public has become aware of it. Few people ignore the problem and only
a few have the chance or the knowledge to take action. The problem of
desertification in Patagonia overcomes the plans that have been elaborated to
fight it. That is why efforts shouldn’t be shy, nor limit the imagination to
come up with alternative solutions. ‘If geography is the manifestation of a
society in the physical space,a deteriorated physical space is the reflection
of a deteriorated society, say Valle and Coronato (researchers from the
National Center of Patagonia).

In Chile, where [62% of the national territory is already affected by
desertification
[es]](http://www.conaf.cl/?seccion_id=8ad00d8dd61d22aa152575a1e5c08e58&unidad=0&PHPSESSID=db19e79870c9e01418e62b8576a26daf),
blogger Alfredo Erlwein expressed concern on the blog _El Ciudadano [es]_ (The
Citizen) on how [little knowledge citizens have about
desertification](http://www.elciudadano.cl/2009/03/26/desertificacion-y-
sequia-el-gran-problema-ambiental-de-chile-y-el-mundo/).

Desertification is indeed the biggest but least known environmental problem in
Chile. There are vast areas, such as the Eight Region’s coast, where the
severe erosion exceeds 50 percent of the surface: this means that more than
half of the land has been lost, literally. In those areas there are grooves of
over 50 meters of depth. A normal range of land formation is of about 0.2.
centimetres per year, which proves the severity of the matter.

According to Italian expert Candelori, [using soil in the carbon market will
help fighting
desertification](http://www.tierramerica.info/nota.php?lang=eng&idnews=3207);
this can be decided during the Copenhagen conference. The countdown to
Copenhagen has begun and the world awaits it.
