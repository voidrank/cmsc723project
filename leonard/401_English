Internet in Syria has been heavily censored for years. Seemingly harmless
sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia Arabic have only been accessible
through proxies and various circumvention software. Syrian users even set up
Facebook groups and mailing lists to share info on the latest working proxies,
and they have generally succeeded in staying one step ahead of government
censors.

Today, [Forward Magazine](http://www.forwardsyria.com/) broke exciting news
that thousands of Syrian were waiting to hear; “[Syria lifts Facebook
ban](http://www.forwardsyria.com/story/390/Syria%20lifts%20Facebook%20ban).”
Syrian tweeps were ecstatic with the news and raced to announce–as well as
verify–their new-found freedom. Their
[pleas](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=101814288623 "Facebook group
calling Syrian President to unblock the site") “Mr. President, tear down this
wall” have finally been heard; the wealth of information, networking
opportunities, and funny cat videos provided by the previously blocked sites
is now one step easier to reach.

Abdulsalam Haykal, a Syrian entrepreneur and influential media figure,
[announced](http://twitter.com/abdulhaykal/status/34926623149006848) some
insider info about a directive to lift the ban:

> To be made public soon.
> [#Facebook](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Facebook "#Facebook") will be
> officially unblocked in [#Syria](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Syria
> "#Syria") as of today.

Basel Hamadeh
[confirms](http://twitter.com/#!/mrb_101/status/34987346583617536):

> [#Facebook](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Facebook "#Facebook"),
> [#youtube](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23youtube "#youtube") and
> [#Blogspot](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Blogspot "#Blogspot") has
> confirmed to be open in [#Syria](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Syria
> "#Syria") ISP's is processing the request right now ! :)

Adnan Homsi [adds another
discovery](http://twitter.com/#!/adnanonline/status/34947606605991936) to the
unblocked list:

> و الويكيبيدا العربية كمان , شكلنا اخدنا وش و كترنا :P

Arabic Wikipedia as well, we're almost getting a little bit too comfortable
there :P

Some users however were unable to see the changes, but tweeps were quick to
ease their frustration. Wael Orabi
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/w43L/status/34987413457608705):

> @[Seleucid](http://twitter.com/Seleucid) it's a matter of time, ISP needs to
> update their systems. by tomorrow it's gonna be applied to everyone

Similarly, Bashar Kokash
[explains](http://twitter.com/#!/Bashar_Kokash/status/34935295719911424) the
process:

> @[MazenMS](http://twitter.com/MazenMS) maybe not all ISPs unblocked it yet,
> I'm using STE connection now and it's really unblocked

_Seleucid_ [is
overjoyed](http://twitter.com/#!/Seleucid/status/34988941954260992) with the
news, and he thinks lifting the ban is a largely influenced by the pro-
democracy protests in Egypt:

> I can't believe I'm witnessing something this beautiful :’). Thank you
> [#Jan25](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Jan25 "#Jan25"), thank you.
> [#Syria](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23Syria "#Syria")

He [adds](http://twitter.com/#!/Seleucid/status/34980742853300224):

> لك الله حيو شعب مصر! فكوا حجب سوريا!!!!

May God bless the people of Egypt! They unblocked Syria!!!

Eventually he continues to [welcome an open
Youtube](http://twitter.com/#!/Seleucid/status/34992390896881664), and [asks
the US government](http://twitter.com/#!/Seleucid/status/34988503376859136) to
match the move by [removing the
sanctions](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=129575523730332&v=info
"Facebook group calling for an end to censorship, and US sanctions against
Syria") that block Syrians from accessing any and all software developed by US
companies no matter how harmless it is, and [he
concludes](http://twitter.com/#!/Seleucid/status/35004220876791808) by
analyzing the significance of the latest developments in the country:

> Open youtube changes your world… I'm not joking.
>
> Syria has freed us of all restrictions. Now it's time for the US to follow
> suit.
>
> What we're witnessing in Syria right now is the death of the old guard.
> Might have bigger implications than a simple unblock.
