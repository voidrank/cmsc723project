In what some geologists have described as rare occurrences, Malawi's northern
district of
[Karonga](http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/EGUA-7YYRLC?OpenDocument)
has in the past three weeks experienced a total of 30 earthquakes resulting in
at least 5 deaths, over 200 people injured and over 3,000 made homeless. Fresh
reports say another earthquake hit Karonga Sunday 27th December and more are
expected.

Since Malawi's president Bingu wa Mutharika declared Karonga as a national
disaster area, appeals for help to the victims have been pouring to help the
people in the [uranium mining district](http://www.mining-
technology.com/projects/kayelekerauraniummin/).

Bloggers have also been quick to share their reactions. A question that
lingers on the minds of many Malawians is the cause of the earthquakes. In a
well-detailed post titled [_The missing Pieces of the Karonga Earthquake
Puzzle_](http://afrisciheroes.wordpress.com/2009/12/19/the-missing-pieces-of-
the-karonga-earthquake-puzzle/), Muza Gondwe attempts to raise and answer the
question:

While **Muza** tries to provide the geological perspective,
[**Ndagha**](http://ndagha.blogspot.com/2009/12/malawis-parties-ignore-
karonga.html) shares his frustrations with the non-response of Malawi's
political parties which he claims could have poured into Karonga if it were
campaign time.

> _Is it that the parties do not have the money to give out to the victims or
> the area is not campaign friendly? I remember that earlier in the campaign

> giving money to Ndirande market fire “victims” in Blantyre.

> _You may wish to note that no one was reported dead or even injured yet the

Meanwhile the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Environment has
dispelled rumors that the Karonga earthquakes have been caused by the mining
works at Kayerekera which is 35 km away from the district heaquarters. The
ministry says that the uranium mine is an open pit and has no underground
activities hence has no connection to the earthquakes.

Just before the earthquakes in northern Malawi, Malawi was experiencing four
major economic challenges surrounding fuel, forex, power and water. These left
blogger **Austin Madinga** wonder if Malawi leadership was learning [anything
from the happenings:](http://madinga.blogspot.com/2009/11/are-we-learning-
from-happenings-around.html)

> _We have water shortages in Blantyre, power and fuel shortages country wide

On fuel crisis, journalist [**Richard
Chirombo**](http://zachimalawi.blogspot.com/) tried to put the situation into
historical perspective by pointing out that Malawi cargo was stuck in
Mozambique due to a decline in the use of the Beira port.

> _MALAWI has for the past ten years registered a sharp decline in the use of
> Beira Port in Mozambique, according to traffic statistics sourced from the
> port’s authority.  
>  A report from Cornelder de Mozambique, the company that won a 25 year-long
> concession from the Government of Mozambique in 1998 to run the port, points
> to a sharp decline in the use of the port by Malawian exporters and
> importers.  
>  It says, for instance, that, while the country’s imports and exports
> traffic amounted to 570 million metric tonnes in 1998- and went on to reach
> a 1, 3 million metric tonnes peak in traffic in 2002- Malawi has failed to
> beat its own record peak of 2006_.

The fuel importers and governments of Malawi and Mozambique blamed each other
for the fuel crisis that hit Malawi for a consecutive four weeks plus in
November and December.
