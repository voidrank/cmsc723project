A 65 year old man had a personal collection with more than a million old toys,
mostly made in Mexico. Mexican Architect Robert Shimizu, along with his son,
decided to open their house as a toy museum. Their subtitled video documentary
_[A Mexican Toy Story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G_RUIr6VSk "A Mexican
Toy Story")_ tells the story of how it came to be and how they believe that
through toys, Mexico can recover its path.

The [Mexico Antique Toy Museum](http://museodeljuguete.mx "Toy Museum Mexico")
[es] has organized several events with the aim to bring together collectors
and rekindle the interest for locally produced products such as toys. In May,
they will be hosting a [Toy Design and Construction
workshop](http://museodeljuguete.mx/taller-de-diseno-y-construccion-de-
juguetes/ "Toy design and construction workshop") [es], and the best toy to
come from it will be permanently displayed in the museum.

The description in many of the videos of the [Museum's YouTube
Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/ToyMexicoMuseum?feature=watch "Toy Museum
YouTube channel") summarizes their mission:

> El Museo del Juguete Antiguo México pretende ser un museo honesto para todas
> las edades sin importar el nivel socioeconómico, sin pretensiones, brindando
> al visitante no sólo un sitio de aprendizaje y relaciones sino también de
> confort, en donde se beneficiará a la sociedad mexicna [sic], a través del
> fomento de la cultura popular, para lograr así un refuerzo en la identidad
> nacional y en los lazos entre mexicanos, una mayor comunicación de nuestro
> pasado, presente para así cambiar el futuro de nuestro país.

The Museum of Antique Toys Mexico aims to be an honest museum for all ages
where socio-economic levels don't matter, an unpretentious space that offers
the visitor not only a place of learning and relations but also an area of
comfort where the Mexican society will benefit through the promotion of
popular culture, thus strengthening the national identity and the bonds
between Mexicans, a greater communication of our past and present to change
the future of our country.

An example of how the Museum promotes the popular culture experience, the next
video shows a [_Lucha Libre_
exhibition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWLJbDUmmw8 "Lucha Libre at the
Mexican Toy Museum") which took place in the Museum to celebrate their 3rd
anniversary.
