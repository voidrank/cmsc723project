In December this year world leaders will gather in Copenhagen, the capital of
Denmark, to craft a new treaty on global carbon emissions. The outcome of
United Nations Climate Change Conference ([COP15](http://en.cop15.dk/)) and
the treaty that will emerge from it – the successor to the Kyoto Protocol –
will determine the fate of several vulnerable countries in the world,
including the low-lying Indian Ocean island state, the Maldives.

A series of events and activities are being organized in the Maldives to bring
the attention of the world to the plight of Maldives, with the hope that a
fair deal will be made at the COP15 conference.

A youth group organised the local event for [The Global Climate Wake-Up
Call](https://secure.avaaz.org/en/sept21_hub/) initiated by Avaaz.org.
Children and adults joined the event held at Artificial Beach of Male’, the
capital of the Maldives.
