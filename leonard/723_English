Because of its ties to ethnicity, culture and a growing import food bill, land
tenure is one of Fiji’s most pressing problems. The country’s military-backed
government will soon attempt to reform the country’s land tenure system, which
has largely remained untouched since the mid-1970s, shortly after independence
from Great Britain.

By law and through very complicated traditional arrangements, indigenous
Fijians own roughly 87 percent of the land on Fiji’s 300 islands. The
government owns six percent and the remaining portions can be bought and sold
by people of any ethnicity. This has left the Indo-Fijians, who make up around
40 percent of the population and are descendants of the country’s indentured
servants brought over by the British to work in sugar and copra plantations,
largely landless.

Fiji’s post-independence government thought it had brought stability to the
land tenure issue in 1976 when it created a system for 30-year leases and a
secure rental structure. However, Fijian landowners long
[complained](http://www.nltb.com.fj/commentary/00_05_02.html) their rents were
meager, especially when the government negotiated those rates. When the
[majority](http://tinyurl.com/23zdpy6) of leases came due between 1997 and
2001, landowners only renewed about one quarter of the contracts. Half of the
land was rented to other tenants and the remaining 30 percent was never re-
allocated.

This forced farmers of both ethnicities streaming into the cities looking for
work. The lost leases also helped bring the downfall of Fiji’s sugar industry,
which once amounted to 12 percent of the country’s GDP and employed nearly
one-third of the population. Today, it has fallen to
[around](http://www.fijilive.com/news/2010/06/11/26276.Fijilive) three percent
of GDP. At the same time, Fiji’s food import bill has increased dramatically.
Fiji’s government has
[attempted](http://fijitimes.com.fj/story.aspx?id=147963) to become more self
sufficient by [funding
projects](http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=147720)to grow crops for
domestic use.

Crosbie Walsh says the government needs to tread lightly and summon as many
stakeholders as possible before passing any reform, especially if it is
thinking about allowing international investment in land-based businesses.

“The need to make better commercial use of native land is irrefutable,” he

rules.html) in _Fiji: The Way It Was, Is and Can Be_ :

plan will most likely fail because leaders don’t understand the real problems
tied to the land tenure issue and Fiji’s sugar industry.
