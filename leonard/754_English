For two months, [Red Shirt
protesters](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/thailand-red-shirt-
protests-2010/) occupied the streets of Bangkok demanding the resignation of
the prime minister. The protest camps have been dismantled already but the
city is still reeling from the political crisis.

The [violent
confrontations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/16/bangkok-clashes-
pictures-videos-and-twitter-reports/) between the heavily armed soldiers and
protesters in the past week have stunned the world. What are the reactions of
bloggers from neighbouring Southeast Asian nations?

A few days ago, the Thailand government revealed that Cambodian “mercenaries”
were hired by the Red Shirts to sow
[violence](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/20/thailand-arson-in-
bangkok-protests-spread-to-other-provinces/) in the city. This accusation
elicited strong reactions in Cambodia.
_[Khmerization](http://khmerization.blogspot.com/2010/05/mop-up-operation-in-
bangkok-under-way.html)_ reminds the Thailand government that there are many
ethnic Khmers in Thailand who are already Thai citizens.

> Many red shirt protesters were mainly made up of ethnic Khmers and Laotians
> living in the northeastern provinces of Thailand who are Thai citizens. We
> need to remember also that the Thai media owned by the Red Shirt Movement
> also accused the Abhisit government of dressing up Khmer prisoners in
> military uniform and sent them to crackdown on the red shirt recently. How
> true are these rumours? Nobody knows.

_The Son of the Khmer Empire_ believes the motive for spreading this rumor is
to [demonize Cambodians](http://sokheounpang.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/mop-up-
operation-in-bangkok-under-way-with-rumours-that-khmer-mercanaries-among-red-
shirts/)

> I believe the rumour is circulated intentionally and politically in order
> to…make the Khmer as scapegaot to appease Thai anger against each other and
> turn the revenge/hatred towards Khmers and esp. the bloody Thai elite and
> royal family will not be held responsible for the bloodshed.

[Filipino journalist](http://jotorres.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/no-bribes-in-
bangkok/) Joe Torres visited a Red Shirt protest site

> It was like our [EDSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSA_Revolution)

streets

> Our old hotel, the VIP Golden House, is inside the zone. It will stay closed

_Southeast Asian Archaeology newsblog_ warns that the protests are affecting
[attendance in
museums](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2010/04/13/protests-toll-
visitors-museums-

near the protest zones

> Most of you would be familiar with the protests going on in Bangkok, which

_Musings from the Lion City_ , a [Singapore blogger](http://hardhitting-
nobs.blogspot.com/2010/05/no-easy-way-out.html), analyzes Thailand’s political
situation

Twitter and Facebook were extensively used to monitor the situation in
Bangkok. Jonathan Russell provides a better and clearer context about the
[usage of social media](http://jonathan-russell.com/2010/05/25/round-up-thai-
protestssocial-media-stories/) in relation to the Red Shirt protests

> While I do agree Twitter, and more prominently Facebook, amplified hateful
> comments, many of the vitriol online (though worrying itself) can be put
> down to extreme opinions which do not represent the popular opinion.
>
> A minority of Thais use Facebook (around 3 million) and Twitter (less than a
> million), and of these the comments came from a small percentage. For
> example, an vitriolic Facebook Group with 1,000 is large number but, in the
> bigger picture, is 0.03% of Thai Facebook members and clearly not
> representative of any kind of majority.
>
> I agree that the manner in which social networks can legitimize vitriolic
> groups which grew in Thailand during the protests is worrying. As the
> average Facebook users is more likely in Bangkok, middle class or affluent,
> and not a red shirt, much of comments and rage were against the UDD and its
> protest.
