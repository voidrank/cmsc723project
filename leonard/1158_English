Yesterday Muslims in many South Asian countries celebrated [Eid-ul-
Fitr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr) marking the end of Ramadan,
the holy month of fasting. Many bloggers exchanged greetings and shared their
rituals and traditions.

**Pakistan:**

_Momina_ at _Chowrangi_ [explains](http://www.chowrangi.com/the-celebration-
of-eid-ul-fitr.html) different aspects of the Eid celebrations:

> Eid is derived from the root word of `Aada meaning returned. We all know
> that we return to Eid periodically. It is also said to have been derived
> from ‘Aadah meaning a custom or a practice. The reason is that people
> customarily celebrate it.

what Eid meant for her and her family while growing up.

> Growing up, my favorite part of Ramadan and Eid ul-Fitr always centered
> around two things – my family and food. On Chand Raat, the night before Eid,
> I loved going to the market to buy bangles or get henna painted on my hands.
> My memories of Eid as a child were flooded with color, bright new clothes,
> laughter, and the taste of sivaiyyan [vermicelli noodles in sweetened milk]
> first thing in the morning.
>
> As an adult, Ramadan has become increasingly a time to think about others
> around me, particularly the poor. Working in the development realm has
> helped put such issues into further context.
