anniversary-of-election/)demonstrations – protested in a few places including
the universities to defy the Islamic Republic regime one more time.

There was a heavy security presence in Ferdowsi Sqaure in the center of
Tehran:

that protesters clashed with security forces in Vali Asr street in Tehran, and
lighted trash cans on fire.

While _Iran Green
Voice_[posted](http://www.irangreenvoice.net/article/2010/jun/12/4379) that
1000 of students from University of Tehran clashed with security forces, a
reader left a comment: “Why do we lie, we become like them [Islamic
government]. I was there and the number was about 50 people.”

Mean while _United4Iran_ , a non-partisan global network of Iranian and non-
Iranian individuals and human rights activists,
[organized](http://united4iran.com/) demonstrations in 70 cities around the
world.
