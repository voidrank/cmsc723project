Iranian bloggers welcomed the
[departure](http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2011/02/11/17238096.html) of
Egyptian president [Hosni Mubarak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak)
today with both joy and envy. It is an amazing coincidence that Mubarak was
brought down on exactly the 32th anniversary of the [1979
revolution](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Iranian_Revolution)
when the Shah was overthrown.

Some bloggers also use the occasion to remind readers that the Green Movement
is calling for demonstrations on Monday, February 14 [in the name of Egypt and
Tunisia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/08/iran-protesting-in-the-
name-of-egypt/).

_Mihanparast_ (means ‘Patriot’)
[writes](http://patriot21.blogfa.com/post-13.aspx) [fa] with irony, “Why did
Mubarak have to leave now, he could have waited two days and left with Seyed
Ali [Ayatholah Khamenei].”

_Rag be Rag_ [congratulates](http://ragberag.blogspot.com/2011/02/blog-
post_11.html)[fa] Egyptian brothers and sisters and says, the key to victory
is keeping religion and state separated.

_Greenlights_ [writes](http://www.greenrights.blogfa.com/post-6.aspx) [fa]
that for all the blood spilled on the ground he will take part in the 14
February demonstration.
