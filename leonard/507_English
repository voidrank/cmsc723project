Recently, it has been
[reported](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPCmGp91WeXbJyvcbZBOOznLBn2g?docId=CNG.01fcdc48866ebfaad291c49ce52c3efd.831)
that an arranged marriage between a 14-year-old girl and a 23-year-old teacher
‘has triggered a call for a fresh debate on child marriage’. Under Malaysia’s
Syariah Law, which has jurisdiction over Muslims, Muslims under the age of 16
would require the consent of the Syariah Court before a marriage is allowed.
In this case, the Court had granted permission for the couple to marry.

Glenda Larke [believes](http://glendalarke.blogspot.com/2010/12/when-malaysia-
makes-me-sad.html) that a child marriage is no different to paedophilia, even
if it is legal.

> A 14-year-old school girl is not an adult. She's not a woman, even if she
> has started her menses. She's still a child. She looks up to adults. Her
> religion and her culture tell her to obey her elders, especially her
> parents. She is gullible and vulnerable.
>
> A 23 year old man who marries her – an educated man, not some illiterate
> fellow whose society is still steeped in the 19th century idea that children
> should be working at 12 and married at 14 – is purely and simply a
> paedophile.

B.Joe [is of the
opinion](http://balajoe27.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/snippets-%E2%80%93-6-december-2010/)
that the rights of children and minors are not being upheld by the Syariah
Court and the girl’s parents.

> And the funny part of the whole deal is that the marriage was approved by
> the Syariah Court – what happened to the protection of the minor? Why the
> parents could not wait for a few more years until the minor is able to
> decisions for herself?

Un:dhimmi also [believes](http://undhimmi.com/2010/12/05/14-year-old-muslim-
girl-marries-publicly-in-malaysia/) that it is morally wrong.

> Study after study shows that girls subjected to sexual activity at such
> early ages suffer not only damage to their still-developing reproductive
> systems, but also lasting psychological trauma.

However, Fyzal [took a more neutral stance](http://fyzals-
territory.blogspot.com/2010/12/underage-marriage-in-malaysia.html) on the
issue.

> In the situation above the consent of Syariah Court has been obtained. That
> means we should have confidence in our Syariah Judges – they must have taken
> into account all circumstances before granting consent.
>
> Such consent, I believe, had been granted on the confidence of the judges
> that the man can take care of the girl and the girl could grow up well under
> the care of that man. If the judge doubted it, such consent will not be
> granted.
>
> Thus, I submit that in the issue of the marriage of Muslim girls under the
> age of 16, lets the Syariah Courts do their work. They know when to grant
> the consent and when not to grant the consent.
>
> But I am of the view that open discussion is still required between the
> Government and the Syariah experts to deal with this issue.
