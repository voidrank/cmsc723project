Russia and Venezuela have maintained a close commercial relationship since
2005: the South American country has invested over [$US 4
billion](http://en.mercopress.com/2010/10/18/russia-agrees-to-build-500mw-
nuclear-power-station-in-venezuela) in Russian armament in the last few years.
President [Hugo Chavez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_chavez), who is on a
tour throughout Europe and Asia, arrived in Russia (the ninth visit he makes
to this country) last October 14 and met with his counterpart [Dmitry
Medvedev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev). During their meeting,
Chavez and Medvédev signed an “action plan” on different subjects: financial
sector, hydrocarbons, armament sales (35 tanks T-72 y T-90), agriculture,
telecommunications, transportation, culture and atomic energy.

The expectations generated by his visit were met with a deal to build [an
atomic facility of 500
megawatts](http://english.eluniversal.com/2010/10/15/en_pol_esp_putin-
announces-sale_15A4612783.shtml). The building of the site would take about 10
years. Venezuela is the first Latin American country to sign an atomic energy
deal with Russia.

Reactions to the announcement started emerging at once. The US State
Department’s spokesman in the White House, [Philip Crowley
said](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5giSby4XvXH7Mxz7Gpo9KeA_b_X2A?docId=CNG.d4436e9f04d08331279fb14066d6d028.331),
“This is something that we will watch… very, very closely.”

and now the gringos have started squealing because now we are going to use
nuclear energy, show respect, we are a sovereign and socialist country, “viva

The governor of the state of
[Miranda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda,_Venezuela),[ Henrique Capriles
Radonski [es]](http://www.globovision.com/news.php?nid=165555) criticized,
“They talk about nuclear plants when there are over 3 million children
excluded from the school system, 58% of children in primary education do not
finish ninth grade and only a 5% finish the diversified cycle. That reality
must be changed by all of us, I am an instrument, but without you we cannot
change that reality.”

Venezuela is going through the worst electric energy crisis of its history,

The permanent Venezuelan representative at the United Nations, Jorge Valero,[
ratified [es]](http://www.avn.info.ve/node/23616) “That the NPT (Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty) does not only seek the elimination of nuclear weapons
but also the equal access to nuclear technology for civilian purposes,
therefore ‘the Venezuelan Government vindicates the sovereign right of all
countries to develop their nuclear industry with peaceful ends’.”

Apparently, when it is about “becoming a superpower”, it does not matter if it
is the socialist or capitalist way: the longed for end justifies the means.
Besides, it is easy to count with partners for this kind of enterprise; well-
intended and even altruistic partners that work so that nations can achieve
their independence. In this case, Venezuela has Russia.

Juan Cristobal from the blog _[Caracas
Chronicles](http://www.caracaschronicles.com/node/2727)_ presents “5 reasons
to not worry about the nuclear ambitions of Hugo Chavez”:

The construction of the nuclear plant is in its preliminary stage and mounting
this kind of infrastructure is not easy for a developing country that has many
factors against it: A mounting debt that is growing uncontrollably, a
[National
Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Venezuela) where
the government does not hold a super majority, and a social deterioration
reflected in the 30 homicides per weekend, making Caracas one of the most
violent cities in the world. President Chavez will have to analyze how
feasible it is to materialize his wishes at this time.
