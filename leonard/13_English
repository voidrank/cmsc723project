the 311 Tohoku Tsunami in Rikuzentakata, Japan

One year and ten months have passed since [the Great East Japan Earthquake hit
on March 11,
2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2011-special-
coverage/japan-earthquake-tsunami-2011/ "Japan Earthquake 2011"). The affected
areas are now making steps towards recovery thanks to the support from all
over Japan and around the globe. However one remaining issue, disaster debris
incineration, is dividing the country.

There are 910,000 tons of disaster debris in Miyagi prefecture, and another
430,000 tons in Iwate prefecture which [need to be
incinerated](http://www.reconstruction.go.jp/topics/20121127_higashinippondaishinsai_fukkohjokyoh.pdf
"PDF link to document by Reconstruction Agency of Japan.") [ja]. 370,000 tons
of debris from Miyagi prefecture and 170,000 tons from Iwate prefecture are
being arranged to be incinerated in 10 other prefectures, because there is
just too much debris for them to dispose of themselves.

In May 2012, Kitakyushu city accepted the debris, and protesters desperately
tried to stop incineration by [crawling under the
truck](http://blog.livedoor.jp/wbrwtg/archives/51882458.html "Blog: Citizen
Crawl Under Truck Loaded with Debris of Normal Level of Radiation") [ja]
loaded with debris. A[ website](http://one-world.happy-net.jp/ukeire/
"http://one-world.happy-net.jp/ukeire/") [ja] dedicated to compiling
information about local governments accepting disaster debris mapped the
status of rubble from tsunami stricken areas.

But people in the affected areas, who have to see piles and piles of disaster
debris every day, feel very differently about the debris distribution
incineration program. [The town of
Onagawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onagawa,_Miyagi
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onagawa,_Miyagi") in Miyagi prefecture showed
their gratitude to Tokyo prefecture for accepting debris by distributing
60,000 [saury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saury) fish for free at the Hibiya
Park on October 20, 2012. The following comments are from Twitter mentioning
the free saury distribution with a hashtag #秋刀魚収穫祭 ( saury harvest festival).

[The town of Taki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taki,_Mie
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taki,_Mie"), in Mie prefecture [had to withdraw
its offer](http://www.isenp.co.jp/news/20121117/news04.htm "Ise News Paper")
[ja] to accept debris, because 12 out of 13 members of their town council were
against it. The prefecture is still looking into the incineration program, but
_[Hahanowa](https://www.facebook.com/groups/241981385917111/ "Facebook Group
of Hahanowa") _[ja], a group of mothers handed a proposal to the Mayor of Ise
City in Mie Prefecture on December 4 2012, asking for a clear explanation
about debris incineration with a request to stop accepting all debris in the
future.

[In the blog of ](http://hahanowa.exblog.jp/17202869 "Blog: Hahanowa about
proposal to Mayor of Ise city")_[Hahanowa](http://hahanowa.exblog.jp/17202869
"Blog: Hahanowa about proposal to Mayor of Ise city") _[ja], a mother of a
one-year-old child writes about her anxiety about the wide debris distribution
incineration program:

>
> 様々な勉強会に参加して、それから三重県主催の説明会にも参加して、ますます不安が募る我々。「低線量被曝は安全」、「がれきには放射性物質は付着していないから安全」等々、市民が主催する勉強会の内容とはまったく反対の説明をする環境省と三重県。  
>  私達、どう対処すればいいの？

> I have participated in various study groups [on debris incineration], and I
> also went to one hosted by Mie prefecture. But our anxiety continues to
> grow. The Ministry of the Environment and Mie prefecture tell us “low dose
> exposure [to radiation] is safe”, ” it's safe because no radioactive
> substance is attached to debris” and so on, all of which is completely
> opposite to what we have learned in study groups. What are we supposed to do
> about this?

Kyushu Himawari Project, a group that studies problems related to wide area
incineration [made a call to
action](http://hinanohanasi.blogspot.jp/2012/08/fax-911-jv-89-httphinanohanasi.html
"Blog: Kyushu Himawari Project, Urgent Call to Miyagi Governor") [ja] to send
letters, faxes and emails asking Governor Murai of Miyagi Prefecture to stop
transporting debris to other prefectures.

Given that the petitions to stop debris from entering Kitakyushu city are
flooding in to Miyagi's assembly, the Twitter account of newspaper Asahi
Shimbun's Sendai branch commented that [these persistent actions are giving
mixed feelings](https://twitter.com/asahi_sendai/status/259260213864050688
"Twitter @asahi_sendai") to him [ja].

According to[ a document published by the Japanese government's Reconstruction
Agency](http://www.reconstruction.go.jp/topics/20121127_higashinippondaishinsai_fukkohjokyoh.pdf
"PDF : Reconstruction Agency: Recovery Status of Tohoku Region") [ja] on
November 27 2012, of a total of 18,020,000 tons of disaster debris, only 27
percent has been disposed. The Reconstruction Agency's goal is to finish
disposal of disaster debris by the end of March 2014.
