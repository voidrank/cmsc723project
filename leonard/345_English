In the town of Valparaiso in Chile, a downhill mountain bike competition has
been taking place for the last 10 years; the [Valparaíso Cerro Abajo
cup](http://www.valparaisocerroabajo.cl/). What makes it different from many
other downhill races is the location: this race takes place in the city
streets and sidewalks.

competitor doing a trial run before the actual race, zig-zagging through the
streets guided by plastic lines and cheered by onlookers:

And it seems that not only dogs are likely to walk into the cyclists’ path as
can be seen in this [next video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiUja3r_EWU)
where a person seems more interested in recording the race than in getting out
of the way:

And in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZAKa2wEvMk), riders in
quick succession are seen sorting the obstacles, racing down steps in
sidewalks, riding onto walls and jumping off ramps:

But not only Chile has downhill races in urban areas:[ this next
race](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwYbwH-MGHg), recorded through helmet cam
shows a course that crisscrosses a town in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina:

Or how about [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93UzcOVdYPM) in the
colonial city of Taxco, Mexico, that even goes through people's homes?

It's not all fun and games: in [this
race](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N7vxuAZsUA) in Cuzco, Peru you can see
some of the riders take spills and fall off their bikes:
