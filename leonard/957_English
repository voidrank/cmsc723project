An estimated 100,000 people took to the streets of Copenhagen on Saturday and
marched from Christiansborg Slotsplads to Bella Center – a distance of six
kilometers – demanding climate justice. In one of the strongest messages ever
sent to world leaders to be serious and make a ‘real deal’ in the negotiations
going on at [United Nations Climate Change Conference
(COP15)](http://en.cop15.dk/), people from different countries marched in the
cold winter weather of Copenhagen.

The day started early for activists when they gathered at the DGI-Byen – the
venue of the alternate climate summit [Klimaforum09](http://klimaforum09.org)
– in the morning and marched to the Parliament Square, most of them clad in
blue, in the symbolic event [Flood for Climate
Justice](http://www.copenhagenflood.org/), organized by the [Friends of the
Earth International](http://www.foei.org/). At the Parliament Square, they
were joined by thousands of people, who started a march in the afternoon to
Bella Center, the venue of COP15.

Even though pleasant rays of sunlight provided some warmth for the
demonstrators in the afternoon, as the dusk settled, the temperature dropped
down. As the demonstration ended in front of Bella Center, people were seen
huddled near bonfires lit on the street. The final inspirational speeches were
given by significant figures including former UN human rights commissioner,
Mary Robinson and the 21-year-old climate change activist from India, Deepa
Gupta who is the co-founder of [Indian Youth Climate Network
(IYCN)](http://iycn.in/).

“This global day of action is reminding governments that climate change is
hurting people. This is a human rights issue – climate change is undermining
people’s livelihoods and their access to health and education. It is affecting
poor countries efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Copenhagen
must deliver deep emissions reductions, and at least $200bn a year in new
money to help the poorest countries tackle climate change,” Robinson said.

I am here in Copenhagen to attend the
[Klimaforum09](http://klimaforum09.org/?lang=en), dubbed as ‘The Peoples’
Climate Summit’. It runs parallel to COP15 and has attracted a number of civil
society organizations, environmental justice activists and indigenous people.
“The Bella Center is the biggest case of disaster capitalism. The deal we
really need is not even on the table,” Naomi Klein said in the opening
ceremony of Klimaforum09.

Other high profile visitors expected to speak at Klimaforum09 includes Bill
McKibben, the founder of [350.org](http://350.org/), and Mohamed Nasheed, the
President of the Maldives.

Ecological debt and climate justice are recurring themes in Klimaforum09 and
in Saturday’s demonstration as well.

One of the most colourful groups participating in the demonstration was [The
Climate Debt Agents](http://climatedebtagents.com/) clad in bright red suits.
They called on rich countries to pay their climate debt to poor countries as
part of an [MS ActionAid Denmark](http://www.ms.dk/) initiative. Earlier this
year, 31 Global Voices bloggers were [mentors to students
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/09/08/global-voices-bloggers-mentor-new-
danish-and-african-bloggers/) participating in MS ActionAid's [Global
Change](http://globalchangenow.net/about) programme. It was a pleasant
surprise to meet my mentee among the red suits calling for climate debt to be
settled.

Across the globe, citizens of the world demanded a fair and real deal to be
made from the COP15 talks, as they held vigils and marches to mark the weekend
of [‘The World Wants a Real Deal’](http://tcktcktck.org/realdeal) initiated by
the TckTckTck alliance.

Copenhagen is flooded with activists, journalists, photographers and bloggers
covering the most important climate change negotiations of recent times. At
the [Fresh Air Center](http://tcktcktck.org/freshair) in downtown, a work
environment created by a [TckTckTck](http://tcktcktck.org/) alliance for
bloggers, I met fellow Global Voices author [Mac-Jordan Holdbrookes-
Degadjor](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/07/featured-author-mac-
jordan-holdbrookes-degadjor/). The Global Voices authors in Copenhagen during
this exciting time will try to form[ a small
team](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/copenhagen-climate-
summit-2009/) covering the lively conversations occurring in blogosphere on
COP15.

Blogger _Alex Engwete_ from Congo expresses [deep
skepticism](http://alexengwete.blogspot.com/2009/12/cop15-5th-global-day-of-
action-on.html) of any significant deal to emerge out of COP15:

> In Copenhagen, the US delegation doesn't seem to grasp the urgency of the
> catastrophe and is behaving like a bunch of squabblers and obstructionists.
> And back home in Washington, with vicious and powerful climate skeptics in
> the Senate of the species of Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe
> (author of the 2006 confused pamphlet [“Skeptic’s Guide to Debunking Global
> Warming”](http://www.traditionalvalues.org/read/2960/senator-inhofe-
> announces-public-release-of-ldquoskepticrsquos-guide-to-debunking-global-
> warmingrdquo/)) who is on record calling global warming a “hoax,” I don’t
> see how the Obama administration could really take any really significant
> action in Copenhagen.

Angel, from the Maldives, blogging at _FAMUSHU_ urges people [to think and act
beyond COP15](http://www.famushu.com/blog/illustration/in-harmony-with-
nature/):

> The COP15 summit has begun at Copenhagen, Denmark and everywhere around the
> globe the same voice “save our planet – seal the deal” echoes. My home
> Maldives is one of those helpless and fragile countries that are at the
> frontline to be affected by global warming, at this very moment we can only
> hope that the COP15 summit becomes effective, ‘cos the responsibility rests
> on the shoulders of those countries who emit large amounts of CO2. However,
> each one of us should take the responsibility to care and nurture for our
> mother earth – switch off the lights, chargers etc if you are not using ‘em,
> plant more trees and walk, ride a bicycle or use public transport systems:
> opt for a ‘greener life’ everyone.

In Copenhagen, a number of artists and organizations are having exhibits in
important locations of the city to stress the importance of achieving a fair
and binding agreement out of COP15. However, the real decisions are being made
by negotiators and politicians at Bella Center, and it remains to be seen if
they will listen to the voices of global citizens demanding a fair deal for
the future of the planet Earth.
