As the BP oil spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its aftermath continue to
make headlines, the catastrophe has also brought a little global media
attention to the oil-related woes in another country—Nigeria.

Africa's most populous country, Nigeria is among the [10 biggest
exporters](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-
factbook/rankorder/2176rank.html?countryName=Nigeria&countryCode=ni&regionCode=af&rank=7#ni)
of oil globally and the largest oil producer in Africa. Since oil was
discovered off Nigeria's coast in the 1970s, it has become a major source of
wealth. Oil accounts for [90 percent of Nigeria's
exports](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2836.htm) and over 80 percent of
government revenue.

But these oil riches have not been accompanied by economic prosperity nor food
security for the majority of the country's population. Earlier this year,
preparations took place in northern Nigeria for [anticipated food
shortages](http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=89759), due to severe
water shortages, plummeting livestock prices and rising grain costs. On his
blog, Nigerian Joachim Ibeziako Ezeji, a sustainable development professional,
elaborates [on those impacted by these types of
shortages](http://joachimibeziakoezeji.blogspot.com/2010/06/travails-of-
nigerian-rice.html).

> “Nigeria, a former agrarian nation, abandoned agriculture in the early 1980s
> when the government refocused the economy on oil exploration… Sadly, the
> bulk of this revenue is stolen by politicians and their cronies. The
> consequence is that today, according to the agriculture ministry, 91 million

> insecure.”

Nigeria had a strong agricultural base before the oil boom, but throughout the
years its big farms and plantations have been neglected. Journalist David
Hecht, who wrote a series on [the hunger crisis in
Nigeria](http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/nigeria-oil-rich-hungry)
supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, says that about 90
percent of [Nigeria's agricultural output
today](http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/little-keeps-nigeria-crisis-hunger)
comes from inefficient small farms. Most farmers have little or no access to
modern technology like fertilizers and irrigation. As a result, Nigeria has
become one of the world's biggest importers of food staples, particularly rice
and wheat. Even with these imports though, more than [a
quarter](http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/country.jsp?i=48&c=162&cat=4&sn=1)
of Nigerians younger than 5 suffer from malnutrition.

The country's oil industry, which is primarily located in the Niger Delta, has
also become a source of conflict, corruption and human rights abuses. An
[Amnesty International report](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-
updates/news/oil-industry-has-brought-poverty-and-pollution-to-niger-
delta-20090630) released last year examined these consequences, as well as the
environmental fallout from the industry.

The [Deepwater
Horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill) explosion
earlier this year has also drawn attention to the environmental damage caused
by oil spills, including spills in the Niger Delta. Some media report that
[more oil is spilled in the Niger Delta every
year](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/30/oil-spills-nigeria-niger-
delta-shell) than has been lost in the Gulf of Mexico. These spills cause
pollution that severely affects surrounding communities by decreasing fish
stocks and contaminating water supplies and arable land.

A post on the blog _Niger Delta Unrest_ chronicles [a protest last
year](http://nigerdeltaunrest.blogspot.com/2009/03/bodo-community-report.html
) against the lack of action by
[Shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell) and the Nigerian
government following a large offshore spill. People from the affected
community in Bodo spoke of their grievances:

> “They detailed how there was widespread hunger and thirst in the community:
> all the fish had been killed, the water contaminated, access to the creeks
> blocked and the ground-soil polluted and crops poisoned. One woman presented
> a meager basket of cassava meant to feed her family for a week. It was only
> enough for one person. Another woman pushed forward and said her eight year
> old son had died of hunger… A higher up in the Youth Council, the same one
> who had been interpreting, told of his frustrations and how he felt control
> slipping out of his hands. He said it was getting impossible to calm the
> youth in the town and that he was sure some of them would slip into
> militancy and armed action. ‘A hungry man is an angry man,’ he said.”

Randal Maurice Jelks, blogging on _The Black Bottom Blog_ in the United
States, says that [people in Nigeria and the Gulf coast of Louisiana have more
in common](http://theblackbottom.com/?p=5862) than many would think:

> “For years, the state of Louisiana has permitted oil companies to have the
> loosest of regulation–a wink and a nod instead of enforced laws. As result
> many African Americans, like the Ogoni people of Nigeria, who live in the
> Gulf region have been most affected by what is called Cancer Alley. The
> pollutants from chemical and oil production have poisoned both their lands
> and bodies for years, like the Ogoni people these Black and poor people were
> ignored. The Louisiana state government like the Nigerian government left
> the oil companies to their own devices–laissez faire.”

An analysis in the Nigerian newspaper Vanguard by Peter Osadalor says that
[the World Bank coined the term “Nigerian
Paradox”](http://allafrica.com/stories/201007191601.html) specifically to
describe the extreme underdevelopment and poverty in a country brimming with
resources and potential. Bloggers have proposed various solutions to this
paradox, from [stricter regulation of oil
companies](http://methodismadness.blogspot.com/2010/05/effect-of-oil-spill-on-
health.html) to [better
leadership](http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=5118)
to [decreasing reliance on imported
crops](http://ojesweet.blogspot.com/2008/05/global-food-crisis-and-
nigerias.html).

Hecht, in his article series, says that even though Nigeria faces a serious
food security threat, [the country has enough fertile land to feed
itself](http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/nigeria-oil-rich-hungry) and
much of the region if its oil wealth is invested more wisely. Afolabi Taiwo
Okunola, in a post submitted for a [youth essay
competition](http://youngstars-foundation.org/blog/category/nigeria-pride-
essay/) on the Youngstars Foundation's blog, comes to a similar conclusion,
saying that [refocusing on agriculture is key](http://youngstars-
foundation.org/blog/agriculture-the-future-of-nigeria-as-a-leading-nation/):

> “If the Nigerian government can be dedicated and devoted to the course of
> agricultural, many problems like inadequate supply of food, high expenses of
> the food supply will become outdated. The level of unemployment among
> Nigerian graduates will reduce because many graduates will be gainfully
> employed. In this vein, agricultural produce will increase because
> mechanized farming will be used and Nigerian exporting earnings will
> increase…The quest for power, gross looting of the national treasury by the
> greedy politicians will reduce to a certain extent because many people will
> realize that it is not only oil that can give a nation money but that
> agriculture too is important in that aspect. Therefore, the wicked struggle,
> killing and wanton destruction of lives and property in order to get to the
> position of authority in Nigeria will reduce. In a very short time, Nigeria
> will become a citadel in which other countries will have to come and learn
> from.”
