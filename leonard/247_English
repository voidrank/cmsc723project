The National University of Singapore and Yale University
[announced](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1119931/1/.html)
that they will establish the [Yale-NUS
College](http://www.ync.nus.edu.sg/About-Yale-NUS-College.html) which will be
Singapore's first liberal arts college. The new college will begin operations
in 2013 and will initially accept 150 students

Yale president Richard Levin
[defended](http://www.pressrun.net/weblog/2010/09/yale-on-academic-freedom-in-
singapore.html) the idea of offering a program in Asia

> We believe that if Yale is to engage the world in ways that may shape the
> global future, we should recognize that many nations live by different
> traditions and norms. Despite obvious constraints on the scope of public
> discourse, our investigation shows that there is real opportunity for robust
> inquiry and discussion on the NUS campus. The limitations we would need to
> accept, given Singaporean tradition and law, have to be weighed against the
> opportunity we have to influence over time the curriculum and pedagogy in a
> major part of the world.

However, some members of [Yale faculty](http://markoppenheimer.com/front-
page/yale-in-bed-with-authoritarian-regime.html) pointed out that Yale’s
liberal tradition is not compatible with the ‘authoritarian regime’ in
Singapore. Even the student paper, _Yale Daily News_ , is [not
supportive](http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/feb/11/keep-yale-out-of-
singapore/) of Yale’s expansion in Singapore

> The new Yale-NUS will look like Yale, but it won’t hand out Yale degrees.
> Yale appointees will sit on its board, but likely alongside members of the
> Singaporean government, like those on the NUS board. Its students will take
> classes taught by Yale professors, but in them, they won’t be able to read
> banned books about the regime’s death penalty, jailhouse torture,
> homosexuality prohibition, or its censorship.
>
> Even if local laws do not explicitly limit campus scholarship, self-
> censorship by students and faculty certainly will. Who would publish a fiery
> doctoral thesis in a country that metes out caning for minor offenses? A
> country that slanders and jails academics and authors for running foul of
> its government?

They added that the [University of
Warwick](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GK16Ae01.html) in England
decided not to set up a branch in Singapore in 2005 because of the perceived
lack of academic freedom in the prosperous city state. Even [John Hopkins
University](http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/sep/28/free-speech-a-
concern-for-yale-singapore-college/) closed a research facility when it had a
conflict with the Singapore government.

_The Kent Ridge Common_ , a student-baded paper in Singapore,
[clarified](http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=7794) that politics is freely
discussed in Singapore schools

> Political topics in Singapore, quite frankly, enjoy a no-holds barred
> discussion in NUS.
>
> Rather then operating in a strictly controlled environment where they have
> to watch what they speak, and speak only the good things, lecturers often
> even joke about the inherent flaws or prejudices of ‘sensitive’ topics in
> the lecture halls or classrooms.
>
> Students — young Singaporeans belonging to a completely different
> generation, if anything, are even more engaged and rigorous during classroom
> discussions. Points are often passionately and strongly made in class —
> whether critical or supportive of Singapore’s system — to show that young
> Singaporeans really care about the future of their country, and are not
> merely limited by a myopic and one-sided assessment of Singapore’s system.
>
> Singaporeans have the liberty to speak, and Professors have the liberty to
> teach.

[Koh Choon Hwee](http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=10567) thinks that the presence
of an Ivy League institution in Singapore affirms the prevailing attitude in
society of worshipping the ‘superior’ education of Western countries

> Hence, while I do feel happy for the Yale-NUS College, as an NUS student and
> as a Singaporean, I am aware that this ‘happiness’ exists within a discourse
> of ‘Western superiority’. My ‘happiness’ quickly dissipates into apathetic
> jadedness (read: sian) at this point.
>
> Further, after the euphoria of Ivy League novelty subsides, one observes
> that this is no revolutionary change in substance.
>
> YNC however has the name ‘Yale’ and will have Yale faculty involved in the
> program – to some that may mean all the difference, to others that may not.
> In terms of NUS-branding, perhaps this is that crucial difference.

An anonymous commented in the blog of _my sketchbook_
[rejects](http://seijieiga.blogspot.com/2010/09/yale-and-nus-tie-up.html) the
planned Yale-NUS joint undertaking

> whats up with all these tie-ups?! are the universities here in singapore
> trying (to) gain “instant” credibility by all these? i believe that
> universities in singapore have the capabilities and the capacity to be
> excellent institutions by themselves but of course they have to be patient
> as it will take time…but it will happen…but by doing these tie-ups they are
> short-changing themselves as when the relationship is over, you are left
> with nothing….

Joel Chow [prefers](http://campus-observer.org/content/view/265/36/) that NUS
develop its own brand rather than gain prestige through a partnership with
Yale

> While the partnership with Yale is doubtlessly a coup for NUS, the terms of
> the agreement reflect an unequal burden upon the university that is perhaps
> too high a price to pay for Yale’s brand name.
>
> Furthermore, the partnership with Yale overlooks the organic development of
> our own liberal arts college in NUS and suggests a preoccupation with
> securing big name partnerships rather than looking to our own backyard for
> viable alternatives.
>
> While we have reason to celebrate the partnership with an Ivy League
> institution like Yale, perhaps it is also time we seriously start
> cultivating our own brand name, only then can we really become a leading
> global university centred in Asia.
