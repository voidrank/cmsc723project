One after the other, independent movie theaters are going out of business in
Japan. In this post we will look at the situation in Tokyo, which has the
[largest number of theaters in Japan](http://www.eiren.org/toukei/screen.html
"the number of theaters in Japan: the Motion Picture Producers Association of
Japan.") [ja].

In 2011, two theaters were closed in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward. This year, on
January 29, [Ebisu Garden Cinema](http://gardenplace.jp/gardencinema.html)
[ja] and on February 27, [Cinesaison
Shibuya](http://www.ttcg.jp/cinesaison_shibuya/) [ja] were shut. [Ginza
Theatres Cinema](http://www.ttcg.jp/theatre_ginza/) [ja] will follow suit in
May 2013.

In the Asakusa area, which is home to
[Denkikan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkikan
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkikan"), Japan's first dedicated movie
theater, built in the early 1900s and a symbolic place for Japan's motion
picture, the last three traditional cinema houses [Asakusa-
Meigaza](http://www.e-asakusa.net/meigaza/) [ja], [Asakusa-Chuei
Gekijo](http://www.e-asakusa.net/chuei/) [ja] and [Asakusa-Shin
Gekijo](http://www.e-asakusa.net/shingeki.html) [ja] were forced to shut down
on October 21, 2012.

The [Chuei Corporation](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E6%98%A0) [ja]
which ran the three theaters explained “the deterioration of the buildings”
had forced them to close.

Quite a few people were shocked by the news:

On April 24 2012, a Japanese film director [Koji
Wakamatsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dji_Wakamatsu), who passed away
on Oct 17 this year, made a proposal on Twitter about the country's grant
system on arts and cluture, which has been retweeted 5,927 times as of
November 27, 2012:

Meanwhile, @Dol_Paula tweeted in reply to this question on
[2channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2channel), a Japanese textboard, “What
makes you avoid going to theaters?”

@guitarkids2010 thinks that it is because films themselves have lost their
appeal:

The tide of closing cinemas has changed the look of Tokyo's streets. People
who used to get together and spend time there have lost their place.

@IMAO_S worries about elderly fans of traditional cinema houses.
