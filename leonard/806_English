Only a few days after [“The Cove” was awarded the Oscar as best
documentary](http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/the-cove-
wins-oscar-for-best-documentary) drawing the attention of public and media
around the world to the hunting of cetaceans issue, anti-whaling group[ Sea
Shepherd’s leader Peter Bethune was arrested in
Tokyo](http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/breaking-news-world/sea-shepherd-
antiwhaling-activist-arrested-in-japan-20100312-q2y1.html) [en], re-igniting
the controversy between Japan and Australia – New Zealand.

The protest group activist is charged with trespassing, for boarding a
Japanese whaling ship in the Southern ocean during February while attempting
to make a citizen’s arrest of its captain for the sinking of the Sea
Shepherd’s ship one month earlier (as [previously
reported](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/08/australia-whaling-war-of-
words/) for Global Voices by Kevin Rennie).

Although [Japan’s whaling
program](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/23/japan-whaling-scientific-
research-or-commercial-hunting/) is only authorised for scientific purposes
and most of the Japanese people do not regard whale meat their favourite meal,
the collision with the New Zealand anti-whaling vessel has roused some
[sentiment of nationalism](http://stamen.iza.ne.jp/blog/entry/1500155) [ja],
though weak, in the country.

But ‘jingoistic’ sentiments are also evident in the announcement of Peter
Bethune’s arrest on the [Sea Shepherd official
website](http://www.seashepherd.org/).

> The Japanese whaling ship Shonan Maru 2 arrived in Tokyo today with the
> first New Zealand prisoner of war to be transported to Japan as a political
> prisoner since World War II.As soon as his foot touched Japanese soil,
> Captain Bethune reestablished himself as a national hero in New Zealand and
> an international hero in Australia, France, Britain, the United States, and
> every other country whose citizens deplore the continued illegal whaling
> activities of the Japanese whaling fleet.

In Japan, some feel New Zealand and Australia’s anti-whaling activity as an
attack on their country’s food culture and wonder [why whale meat should be
prohibited while cattle and pig meat is
not](http://tsublog.excite.co.jp/mumble/3a0422ff6238516a4b86552d59540d3d)[ja].
It highlights the contentious divide between slaughtering debatably
intelligent versus non intelligent animals.

In some cases Japanese media increasingly rode the wave of polemic on the
issue. James at [Japan Probe](http://www.japanprobe.com/2010/03/16/sea-
shepherds-sources-of-funding/) posts about Japanese broadcaster NTV’s show
‘Bankisha’ reporting on the Sea Shepherd issue. In the first part of the show
he says, attention is paid to analyzing Sea Shepherd’s funding sources and
budget.

_Masablog_ however [does not agree](http://keekorok.cocolog-
nifty.com/blog/2010/03/post-a1ef.html) with those who use food culture as a
counter-argument deeming it as reductive.

> 何となく日本たたきのようにこの問題をとらえていたが、ちょっと違うみたいだなあ。  
>
> 日本人の反論としてよくあるものに、じゃあアメリカ人は牛を食べるが、それと何が違うんだ？鯨を助けても牛の数が減るだけだ、というものがある。これに対しては、単に鯨は知能が高いからかわいそうだということではなく、殺すのに時間がかかるので人道的に問題があるという議論があるようだ。

Previously, I had regarded this issue as having to do with anti-Japan
sentiments, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  
As counter-argument, some Japanese wonder what the difference is between
Americans eating beef [and Japanese eating whale]. Another one is that even if
whales are protected, it’ll simply cause the number of cows to decrease.
However, the real discussion seems to be humanitarian, regarding the fact that
it takes more time to kill a whale. The issue is not about people being
empathic with whales because of their high intellectual ability.

_Akki_ [says](http://akinobu0224jp.seesaa.net/article/143485125.html) he
condemns the methods used by the animalist group.

> 私自身は捕鯨については賛成も否定もしませんが  
>  （いまどきの高価な鯨を食べるようなお金もないですし）  
>  彼らのやり方は、どう理由があろうがはなはだ迷惑な行為であり  
>  危険であります。本当にケガ人が出たらどうするつもりなんだろう。

I personally neither agree nor disagree with whaling. (I don't have the kind
of money to eat whale meat, anyway.) However, their methods, no matter what
the issue is, are simply troublesome and dangerous. What are they going to do
if someone get hurt?

Australian blogger
[Youngmarxist](http://strangetimes.lastsuperpower.net/?p=611) calls for an
accurate revision of the IWC rules that would regulate whaling at
international levels.

> Reports are hitting the media about draft amendments to international
> whaling rules that are meant to bring Japan, and other whaling nations, back
> under the rule of the International Whaling Commission. The amendments in
> effect will allow nations that are already killing whales to keep on doing
> so with the approval of the IWC, provided that they limit the numbers of
> whales they catch. The exact limits are yet to be decided, and of course
> will only apply if the draft amendments pass.[…]  
>  If this plan ends the ridiculous hypocrisy that is “scientific” whaling, so
> much the better. There is no reason that whales should be treated any
> differently to any other resource. Whales should be managed properly, so
> they aren’t recklessly driven extinct, but there’s no good moral reason to
> privilege the “rights” of whales over the right of humans to hunt them.
