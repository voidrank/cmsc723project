Global Voices has featured several dancing videos from the Philippines. The
most famous video is still the [Dancing Prisoners from
Cebu](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/06/29/philippines-dancing-prisoners-
tribute-to-michael-jackson/) featuring inmates dancing the Thriller song of
the late Michael Jackson.

A dancing video can also be a protest action and this was proven by the
[Dancing Filipina Maids in Hong
Kong](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/29/protest-video-dancing-
filipina-maids-in-hong-kong/). They were protesting the plan of politicians
led by the Philippine president to amend the 1987 Constitution.

This month, budget carrier Cebu Pacific surprised passengers when [female
flight attendants](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/06/philippines-
dancing-flight-attendants/) began to dance while giving airline safety
instructions.

The video of the dancing flight attendants became popular worldwide but it
also generated controversy when women groups denounced the stunt as
[sexist](http://tinesabillo.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/on-gossip-sexism-being-
prude-andor-malicious/). This didn’t stop the company from coming up with a
new dancing video; but this time, only male flight attendants were seen
dancing

Cebu is the queen city of the southern part of the Philippines. It is famous
for its white sand beaches, dried mangoes and now, dancing videos. But before
the dancing youtube videos became a global hit, Cebu officials often welcome
arriving dignitaries by [dancing in
airports](http://www.pia.gov.ph/asean/?m=2&src=pia&sp=37&fi=p070111.htm&no=74).

There is a new Cebu dancing video which features the city’s tax collectors.
The aim is to encourage citizens to pay their taxes on time and to thank
honest taxpayers. Here is the video of the Dancing Tax Collectors

_Gogol Da Blog_ provides links to [various dancing
videos](http://gogolsez.blogspot.com/2010/10/so-they-think-they-can-

[Laiza Penaranda](http://laizapenaranda.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/dancing-
philippines/) cites modern technology for the popularity of the videos

> Filipinos have always been getting in the world’s limelight for quite a

> in catching the attention of other races around the globe.
>
> Modern technology really helped to raise the popularity of the said “dance
