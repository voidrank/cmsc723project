Arsham Parsi is the founder and director of the[ Iranian Queer
Organization](http://irqo.org/) based in Toronto, Canada. In 2008, he
[told](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/05/16/iran-the-internet-is-a-gift-
to-us/) Global Voices, “the Internet has been a gift to us.”

This year, on May 17, the [International Day Against
Homophobia](http://www.homophobiaday.org/), several Iranians, once more used
this ‘gift’ to raise their voices by launching a [“We are
everywhere”](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/We-Are-
Everywhere/109095095845562) campaign, on YouTube, Facebook and blogs against
homophobia worldwide.

In Iran, homosexuality is punishable by death.

**We Are Everywhere**

On [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/We-Are-
Everywhere/109095095845562) several Iranians declared their homosexuality
openly and did not hide their faces.

In another video Shokoofe, a Lesbian, says [fa]:

> My queer experience started by falling in love and I believe everybody can
> feel that in this world. The strange thing was that people around me where
> thinking it was a joke while I was suffering. The most painful thing was not
> being able to talk with people close to you. I could talk, but they did not
> listen. I think we can live in a better world, where you don't face death
> for being in love with a person. I hope our days have a big sun, a rainbow
> and loves that can be talked about without fear.
