[The latest attack](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/nov/23/north-
korea-fires-south-korea) [en] by North Korea on South Korea has put Japan on
the alert. Is it the beginning of a war? Will it be Japan's turn next time? Or
is it just a ‘beat-up’ created by both conservative and alarmist media alike?
People in Japan are alarmed but don't know what to think.

The northern neighbor has always been viewed with suspicion by the Japanese
islanders, as several [missile launches
](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSEO3669420080328) [en] in the recent past
and ongoing issues such as the [abductions of Japanese nationals in the 1970s
and 1980s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_abductions_of_Japanese)
[en] have contributed to create a climate of diplomatic tensions between Kim
Yong-Il's regime and Japan.  
And so stacks of commentaries on the incident have flooded TV programs and
editorials, but media-distrustful Japanese people smell a rat and give their
own interpretations of the incident.

Kayo proposed an [emergency plan](http://kayo.bambina.jp/2010/11/post_161.php)
just in case something terrible happens.

> こんなに近い国で砲撃事件が起こったのは自分が生まれて初めてのことだったから、今までの遠い中東での戦争と違って、すごく現実感があるし、緊張する。

> 「北朝鮮こわいねー」「そうだねー」なんて脳天気な会話は平和ぼけが垣間見えて違和感あるし、「北朝鮮は頭がおかしい国だ！」とか悪態つく人もたくさんいるけど、世の中に余計な怒りを広めてる分全然共感できない。どちらも意味のない会話。

It's the first time since I was born that an attack like this happened in a
neighbor country. It's different from the war in the far Middle East. This
time it's real and makes me nervous.  
I feel quite uneasy when people make careless comments like “North Korea is
really scary! Oh yes, indeed!” typical of a country that is not experiencing
conflict. Many say “North Korea is a crazy country!” with malice in their
words. I really don't understand those who spread rage like this in this
world. They are all meaningless conversations.

> こういうときって冷静に、自分に今できることは何だろうかと、次のステップを考えて実行することが大切じゃないかな。テレビやネットを見て無駄に不安になったり、怒ったりするんじゃなくて。  
>  例えば、サバイバルグッズを揃えたり、非常持ち出し袋をセットしておくとか。って笑われそうだけど、地震の備えにもなるしね。

In cases like this, it's important to think what to do next and consider in a
sober-minded way how one can prepare, without getting anxious and angry
because of the news watched on TV or read on the internet.  
For example, one could prepare survival goods or set up a bag with emergency
stuff. I know that some people may laugh at me but it's also handy in case of
an earthquake.  
Even training your body so that you'd be able to live a little longer in case
something bad happens…People may laugh at me also for this but it can also be
an excuse for a diet, so two birds with one stone.

Fear of an imminent war made some bloggers, like [teruteruasita
](http://terurute.exblog.jp/11607967/), reflect on what counts in life and the
bliss of living in a peaceful country.

> ・・・・・ニュースを見ていて・・・・・鳥肌が立った。  
>  北朝鮮は世代交代にあたって、その軍事力をみせしめるためなどの噂が早くもたっているが、そんなことは・・・どうでもよく、とにかく戦争は・・・怖い。  
>  人間が死んでしまうのが怖い。  
>  みんな家族や友人がいる。  
>  一瞬にして失う。  
>  平和・・・・。それが成り立ってこそ、みんなが幸せなんだ。

…I had goose bumps when I saw the news…  
Rumors said that because of a generation change [in the leadership], North
Korea wants to show off its military power but…I don't care…I'm just scared of
war.  
It's scary that people die.  
Everyone has a family or friends and they can be lost in one second.  
Peace…Only if peace is built will people happy.

But does it make sense all this alarm? some wonder. Or is it just Japan being
hyper-sensitive to whatever actions North Korea takes?  
Chisa Murakami [says](http://tnc.livedoor.biz/archives/65524080.html) things
sound different when asked of a person who actually lives in South Korea.

North Korea's attack really surprised me. I realized that an attack in such a
nearby place could really happen.  
It's sufficient [that Kim Jong-Il says:] “I'm pissed off!” and Japan can be
hit …  
Hmm, what a scary country!  
When the first news arrived I was in the office. It was a holiday but some
people had come to work and we were all glued to the TV.  
Toshi-boy ran to call his sister who was in Seoul but she was watching a
cartoon with her child and didn't know anything [about the attack]…

Freelance writer Shigenobu Gu (具 滋宣), who grew up and lives between South
Korea and Japan, tried to see [the circumstances from the neutral and detached
viewpoint](http://youpouch.com/2010/12/02/083216/) of someone who knows both
cultures very well.

North Korea's attack on November 23 has shocked people for many reasons. This
time even two civilians were involved and the South Korean government issued
the highest level alert warning, a situation that has rarely been seen in the
recent times.  
People were worried for me and in Japan there was quite a nervous atmosphere.
For instance, the number of tourists who canceled their travels to South Korea
increased but reality was slightly different. Although the South Korean
government was active, many don't know that the common people didn't need to
stay away from the streets and nothing changed particularly in their daily
lives.  
Since the scale of the attack was quite large the Japanese media covered it
extensively but in reality troubles between South and North Korea have been
happening numerous times in the last decades. South Korean people are kind of
used to this and “North Korea? Again?”, is often the usual reaction. To the
extent that now, when something particular happens [involving the North],
South Korean media seldom increase their audience share with news on North
Korea.

I felt a quite different level of interest between Japan and South Korea in
regard to this North Korean incident. Perhaps I felt it because I've become
used to living in a peaceful country for there's no doubt that Japan is really
a peaceful country in a good sense.
