On February 28, 2010, [Rare Disease Day](http://www.rarediseaseday.org) will
be marked [with a variety of events and
activities](http://rarediseaseday.us/get-involved/activities/whats-happening-
for-rare-disease-day/) all over the world – as well as with plenty of citizen
media and online participation. The goal is to raise awareness about so-called
[rare or orphan diseases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease ). These
are diseases that affect only a relatively small number of people in any given
country ([definitions vary](http://www.rarediseaseday.org/article/what-is-a-
rare-disease)). But the numbers add up. Worldwide, it is estimated that there
are 6,000 to 8,000 rare diseases.

In Europe alone, 30 million people have rare diseases, according to a
[Eurordis](http://www.eurordis.org/) [report
(pdf)](http://www.eurordis.org/IMG/pdf/princeps_document-EN.pdf) from 2005.

For the most part, rare-disease patients and their families have to cope with
an enormous sense of solitude, fear and vulnerability because there is a
general lack of information about their diseases. There are usually also
limited funds for scientific and medical research or special treatment
centers.

A [Rare Disease Day channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/rarediseaseday) on
YouTube features dozens of videos, ranging from personal accounts to
information concerning specific syndromes, to this [video about dolphin
therapy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEqQgPwlu60). This cartoon in Italian
by artist Bruno Bozzetto was created to help raise awareness about rare
diseases.

**From strength to strength**

Some patients are able to turn their deep sense of frustration into strength
and determination to do more. One woman, Samantha Mina, affected by an
extremely rare disease, [explains in a
letter](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1521749) to a Facebook Group
called Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome Awareness & Support:

> After […] receiving a life-expectancy estimate of six weeks at one point, I
> decided I wanted every second of my own suffering to count by making
> widespread “rare disease awareness” a personal mission of mine. I was
> stunned by the ignorance and neglect I found in the medical community as a
> result of having an “orphan disorder,” and even fell victim to some very
> serious malpractice at the hands of a deceitful surgery professor who
> essentially wanted to use me as a guinea pig for his research.
>
> After that, I decided that no one else should have to endure what I did, and
> that public education through networking and online media is a great way to
> make that happen. That is why I made a [YouTube
> video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=k1y1TRnxfwk ) of my story for the profile
> of the “World Rare Disease Day” Organization, started the FAQ thread here
> (see the “Discussions” tab), and authored the [Wikipedia
> article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_syndrome) on SMA Syndrome (I was
> actually stunned the entry didn't exist as of 2008).

Access to adequate health is a major problem for many families, and many have
joined, and often founded, organizations dedicated to raising funds for buying
medical equipment. They create networks and spread information particularly
about the crucial connections between education and health. They can also
inform citizens about [their patient
rights](http://www.activecitizenship.net/content/view/283/165/).

On the _Rare Disease Support_ website, [Nora tells her
story](http://rarediseasesupport.org/2010/02/19/rare-diseases-and-the-
similarities-between-education-and-health/):

> My son was diagnosed with a rare disease two years ago. He has had twenty
> surgeries, countless doctors appointments and has been robbed of his voice.
> As a result I have willingly and aggressively plunged into the field of
> public health. I sit in classes these days where the people are talking in a
> language that sounds similar, but different. But I have realized that
> helping families with children who have rare diseases is my passion right
> now. […] as you live life with your child’s rare and unpredictable disease,
> you experience moments of crisis and despair, but also clarity and purpose.
> I found my mind making connections between the experience I was having with
> the health care system and my passion for improving the educational system.
> […] I again come to the proposition of a community response. A tipping point
> where people connect with others and help them meet their needs, be those
> needs educational, health related, or other.

**Preventive measures**

Early diagnosis is something that can make a huge difference for many rare
disease patients, and many patient advocates push for life-saving detection
measures. For instance, some severe [errors of
metabolism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_metabolic_disease ) could
be diagnosed through [screening of new born
babies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spectrometry ). With just a
drop of blood sampled from a baby's heel, you could [potentially make a
difference](http://www.parents.com/baby/care/pediatricians-medicine/genetic-
testing/?_requestid=276808&_requestid=276808) between a normal life and a
severely damaged one.

The story of one family in the United States [on
_Rarediseases.org_](http://www.rarediseases.org/briefs/monaco1inamillion)
helps illustrate what a huge difference early detection can make. Jana
Monaco's son Stephen is severely brain damaged as a result of not having been
tested at birth and diagnosed for an enzyme deficiency called isovaleric
acidemia. His younger sister leads an entirely different life, because she
did.

[![AISMME](http://www.aismme.org/images/poesie_per_la_vita_ant.jpg)](http://www.aismme.org/)

In Italy, the [non-profit AISMME Association](http://www.aismme.org/), among
others, was founded in 2005 to promote awareness on a new born screening
technique for early diagnose on some metabolic diseases, and its website
provides [hundreds of links](http://www.aismme.org/mme_sos.asp) to additional
resources and centers across the world related to the hereditary metabolic
disease field.

The importance of hope**

Epasen is a teenager in Finland who writes a moving blog titled [_Living with
sclero – My Life with Localized Juvenile
Scleroderma_](http://livingwithsclero.blogspot.com), a rare chronic autoimmune
disease. She writes about the importance of never losing hope:

> So one day, I decided that it had to come to an end: I'm not a quitter. I
> can not give up all of my dreams for reasons I can not affect. All these
> years I've been thinking “I can not do this, I have scleroderma.” But now
> I've grown to see that it just ain't so: I want to at least try. I have
> chances just like everyone else, I have motivation and a lot of mental
> strength. Why wouldn't I make it? […] All those tears I had cried for losing
> my chances, all those sleepless nights and stressful days […] I cannot
> compare my situation to anyone else's since I'm not them. I don't know what
> healthy really is. But I do know, that I work out six times a week just that
> I'd be able to complete my [military] service with great statements, beat
> the guys or at least be as good as them. As able as everyone else.

a young boy named Jeff wins a speech competition by telling the story of how
he was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disease, known as [Methylmalonic
Acidemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmalonic_acidemia) when he was
only one month old. He gives a proud smile at the end of his difficult speech—
and says: “Thank you ladies and gentlemen for listening…”
