Online forums in Russian cities are in a certain sense a unique phenomenon.
It's not blogs that became the major platforms for open discussion in the
regions, but discussion boards (called more often forums). Unlike Moscow or
Saint Petersburg, where blogs or LiveJournal communities represent the most
important spots in the information space, other Russian cities usually have a
different structure of the blogosphere – if we count the forums as part of the
blogosphere, of course. And, obviously, we should, as they play the most
important role there.

At the same time, forums are underexamined. It's not only that they are
sometimes underestimated by RuNet researchers, it's also because they're worse
indexed by the search engines. In my Ph.D. paper, I performed a study of the
Russian local discussion boards. Below are the summarized results of this
research.

**Technology**

Forums are usually hosted on open platform engines (like
[phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/) [EN], [Invision Power
Board](http://www.invisionpower.com/) [EN] or
[vBulletin](http://www.vbulletin.com/) [EN]). Forums differ by type, size and
the level of political independence. On the one hand, forums imply a higher
level of anonymity. On the other hand, users on such forums have significantly
fewer rights than forum administrators.

**Role of forums**

The impact of forums on the social capital and political mobilization is still
quite questionable. Theoretically, forums should contribute to building local
communities online, filling the “offline gap in the space of social relations”
that is often present in Russia. However, in reality this is often not so.

Of course, sometimes forums become a platform for public campaigns (which lead
to both negative and positive consequences). In 2006, the [Kondopoga
riots](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1071116.html) [EN] were initiated
on the local city forums. Sometimes forums become the leading information
sources in times of disaster (the way it happened with the [Perm forum
_teron.ru_ during the fire in the restaurant in
2009](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/05/russia-online-forum-beats-
media-in-covering-night-club-fire/) [EN]). In the city of Ryazan, portal
_forum.rzn.info_ is mainly dedicated to politics and is one of the most
popular websites in the region. However, in some cities there are no political
forums. For example, in the city of Orenburg the most popular forum is devoted
to fishing ( _orenfishing.ru_ ) [RUS].

Some forums, like _Virtual Grozny_ (forum of the [Chechen
Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya)‘s [EN] capital,
[Grozny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny) [EN]), virtually “die” (it means
that forum users no longer post messages), yet continue to be an important
source of online documents that reflect the time and the people. Back in 2006,
GV [covered Natasha Raslambekova's
story](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2006/10/18/russia-grozny-war-
diaries-1994-95/) [EN] of the First Chechen War, which she had shared at
_Virtual Grozny_. Even after the forum is dead, some of the discussions there
remain quite interesting.

**Forums and freedom of speech**

It seems that forums are monitored very carefully by the regional authorities.
Sometimes monitoring is combined with control. In 2007, independent journalist
_Dmitry Tashlykov_ was [accused of defamation against the governor of Vladimir
region](http://cpj.org/2007/02/russian-journalist-on-trial-for-defaming-local-
gov.php) [EN] because of a comment posted on a Vladimir city forum.

**Audience and transformation to multi-service platforms**

The size of the forum audience (that was measured on the basis of the open
statistics services like LiveInternet, SpyLog or Mail.ru) correlates very well
with the size of the city (correlation coefficient = 0.63), which means “the
bigger the city – the larger the forum.” In the largest cities, forums have
evolved into multi-service portals (just as lots of search engines in the US
turned into portals in the early 2000s, though not many of them have survived
since then). The audience of some portals can be compared to radio stations or
even local TV channels. For example, the Yekaterinburg regional portal
[e1.ru](http://www.e1.ru/) [RUS] boasts 2 million users monthly, while in
Chelyabinsk [74.ru](http://74.ru/) [RUS] has 675,000 users. Of course, it's
important to treat such numbers with caution, since online statistics services
often exaggerate the number of visitors.

The table below presents cities with the most popular forums:

**Russian cities with the most popular Internet forums**

№ | City | Monthly audience of the city forum*, thousand users  
---|---|---  
1 | [Yekaterinburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg) [EN] | 957  
2 | [Nizhny Novgorod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizhny_Novgorod) [EN] | 350  
3 | [Chelyabinsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk) [EN] | 338  
4 | [Novosibirsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk) [EN] | 286  
5 | [Tyumen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyumen) [EN] | 207  
6 | [Perm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perm) [EN] | 198  
7 | [Veliky Novgorod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veliky_Novgorod) [EN] | 154  
8 | [Volgograd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd) [EN] | 148  
9 | [Novokuznetsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novokuznetsk) [EN] | 144  
10 | [Lipetsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipetsk) | 142  
  
_* – with the correction coefficient 0.5_.

In several cities, popular forums have not been found. Most of them are
capitals of [Russia's national
republics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_Russia). The absence of
forums can be explained by poor Internet connection conditions. (It is
important to note that only Russian-language forums were studied; there are
also forums in local languages as well as in English). The other group is
comprised of industrial towns (like
[Dzerzhinsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzerzhinsk,_Russia) [EN] or
[Balakovo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balakovo) [EN]). A possible reason is
that people in smaller towns tend to visit forums of the regional capitals,
which have bigger audiences and are usually more influential.
