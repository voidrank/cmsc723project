With less than three months on the job as the Vice-President for the
[Dominican Corporation of State Electric Companies [es]
](http://www.cdeee.gov.do/) (CDEEE for its initials in Spanish), businessman
Celso Marranzini has seen the need to look for help outside of the country [to
resolve the serious energy
problem](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/19/dominican-republic-solving-
the-issue-of-power-outages/), which has recently reached critical levels.

A delegation headed by Marranzini [traveled to South Korea to seek technical
assistance to help solve the energy problem
[es]](http://www.hoy.com.do/economia/2009/11/8/301097/Marranzini-y-otros-
funcionarios-tratan-energia-en-Corea-del-Sur), in which half of the electrical
plants have been out of service under the argument that they are under
maintenance. However, this has resulted in an energy deficit reaching 600
Megawatts, in which Dominicans have been under 9-10 hours of power outages per
day.

As this is an ongoing problem that seems to be worsening to the current
critical levels, the population has been showing its discontent, after holding
onto the hope that Marranzini could solve the problem. These power outages are
causing frustration and criticism of Marranzini's leadership. Twitter users,
Elvis Medina and Ana Peguero provide some thoughts on the situation:

> Hondo tenía circuito 24 horas hasta que llegó Marranzini, ahora nos dan
> apagones por un tubo… y la factura más cara to los días!!!

(The neighborhood) Arroyo Hondo had energy 24 hours a day until Marranzini
arrived, now we have blackouts, and the most expensive bills.

> para estas navidades, el sr. Marranzini, se convierta en Santa Claus y nos
> regale un poquito mas de ENERGIA…Oremos por eso..

Hopefully for this Christmas, Mr. Marranzini becomes Santa Claus and gives us
a little more ENERGY… Let's pray for that.

In addition, street protests against the power outages have taken place in
places like the province of Barahona and the National District. The most
recent incident took place [in the city of Santiago, where one person died and
many others were arrested
[es]](http://www.7dias.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=63270).

As a previous critic of the CDEEE before being named to head the entity, many
hoped that Marranzini could solve this problem that has been going on for more
than 40 years, and which has become an obstacle in the country's development.

While Marranzini has concentrated on improving the CDEEE's finances and the
reduction of payroll, he has not been able to reduce the blackouts. The
outages have reached the point that they have worsened since he took office in
August 2009, maintaining the electrical system in such a delicate state, that
some have even called for the return of Radhames Segura, his predecessor.

The solution goes beyond changing one public official for another. There are
some that attribute the situation to personal interests and politics. For
others, like [Dr. José Antonio
Vanderhorst](http://www.blogger.com/profile/10513152976382997401), consultant
on electricity, the core issue is the structure of the national electrical
system. He writes on the group blog [Grupo Millenium Hispaniola
[es]](http://grupomillenium.blogspot.com/2009/09/urge-decision-para-cambiar-
el-sistema.html):

> … por sí misma la despolitización es insuficiente. Es absolutamente
> necesario cambiar el sistema (eléctrico) que sigue muy influenciado por el
> paradigma de la CDE y de la capitalización que están orientadas a la oferta,
> cuando los problemas más complejos están en los aspectos sociales,

>
> Es urgente dar un giro para desarrollar e integrar los recursos de la

… depoliticization itself is insufficient. It is absolutely necessary to
change the (electrical) system which continues to be greatly influenced by the
CDE(EE) paradigm and the capitalization that is oriented to the supply, when
the more complex problems are in the social, organizational, and cultural
aspects, which corresponds to the consumption and demand.

It is important to make a shift towards the development and integration of the
resources in demand. The urgency is in the decision to change the law needs to
be introduced in the agreement with the FMI (International Monetary Fund). On
the other hand, we still are left without solving the systemic crisis in the
electrical sector.
