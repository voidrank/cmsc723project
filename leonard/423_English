In the wake of popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, Qatar-based Al Jazeera
is receiving global accolades, particularly for its English-language channel’s
recent coverage. From the _New York Times_ , which
[praised](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28jazeera.html)Livestation,
[english.aljazeera.net](http://english.aljazeera.net), or the channel’s
[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera)), a contingent of
Americans are fighting for the channel to become a part of their cable
packages.

Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor in New York, is one of those Americans. In
a blog post, he [explains](”http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/01/30/cable-
companies-add-al-jazeera-english-now/”):

> Cable companies: Add Al Jazeera English NOW!
>
> It is downright un-American to still refuse to carry it. Vital, world-
> changing news is occurring in the Middle East and no one–not the xenophobic
> or celebrity-obsessed or cut-to-the-bone American media–can bring the
> perspective, insight, and on-the-scene reporting Al Jazeera English can.
>
> Yes, we can watch AJE on the internet. But as much of an internet
> triumphalist as I am, internet streaming is not going to have the same
> impact–political and education impact–that putting AJE on the cable dial
> would have. I can watch AJE in the Zurich hotel room where I am now; I want
> to be able to watch it on my couch at home.

Jarvis also
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/jeffjarvis/status/31752060160446464):

> What the Gulf War was for CNN, the Egypt revolution is for Al Jazeera
> English…except we in America can't see it.

NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen feels similarly,
[expressing](http://twitter.com/#!/jayrosen_nyu/status/31397357203492864) in a
tweet:

> Al Jazeera hosts who fight back when BS is paraded out by their guests are
> showing people in America how bankrupt their electronic press is.

Daniel Streicher, linking to a Huffington Post article on the subject,
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/streicher/status/32101837456801792) earlier
today:

> Why can't we get Al Jazeera English on our TVs in America? Not enough Bieber
> coverage? <http://pulsene.ws/Vr5J>

Rob Hyndman [has an alternative
explanation](http://twitter.com/#!/rhh/status/31797487534604288) for why he
thinks the channel isn't offered in the States:

> America's fear of Al Jazeera comes from its independence. Same as Wikileaks.

There is also a [campaign](”http://iwantaje.com/”) initiated by the channel
itself to urge Americans to demand Al Jazeera English from their cable
providers. The campaign tackles myths and facts and allows users to enter
their zip code and send a letter to their chosen cable provider.

The reasons for the blacklisting of Al Jazeera in the United States is
unclear, though in light of recent events, it can no longer be blamed on
demand: On January 30, the site's Head of Online, Mohamed Nanabhay,
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/mohamed/status/31780042916765696):

> 55% of our Al Jazeera English (http://english.aljazeera.net) web traffic is
> from the US and Canada tonight. #egypt
