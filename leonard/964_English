While the political direction of Madagascar remains mired in total uncertainty
since the [coup d'etat in
March](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/madagascar-power-
struggle-2009/), in Addis Ababa, the international community is again trying
to [mediate an
agreement](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jSBjjiLHHcXnjyFDfDSe3jylZguQ)
between the various political movements. The president of the African Union
and one of the mediators present in Addis Ababa, Jean Ping, [opened the
meeting by stating](http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-11-03-voa56.cfm):

> “The reality as you know it on the ground in Madagascar is characterized by
> fatigue that is felt by the people of Madagascar, people who are hoping the
> crisis will come to an end. A crisis to which, after all, they are the
> hostages. Whereas the socio-economic situation in your country is getting
> worse day by day. The people of Madagascar deserve better destiny and that
> depends completely on you”

This sentiment seems to be shared by a large portion of the blogosphere who
focused their attention on the other challenges affecting Madagascar. Several
provinces are currently plagued by the cumulative disastrous effects of a
severe drought, the toxic spill of a ship wreck that poisoned the livelihood
of thousands of fishermen and the ecological disaster of illegal logging of
the rain forests.  
( **Update** : A power sharing agreement was signed by the 4 political
movements over the week-end
([BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8347942.stm)) where Madagascar will
be led by 3 co-presidents. More analysis can be found on this political
breakthrough on [Reuters
](http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL8252135)and [Madagascar

**The ecological scandal of the Gulser Ana toxic spill**

The Gulser Ana was a [Turkish freighter transporting
Phosphate](http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1498505.php/Leaking-
Turkish-shipwreck-sparks-ecological-emergency-in-Madagascar) that sunk off the
coast of Madagascar, spilling toxic waste in the process and [killing
migrating whales and causing illness among the fishermen
community](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/10/toxic-shipwreck-madagascar-
kills-whales-disease.php). Although the disaster has been reported in a few
media recently, the ship started to sink two months ago as Malagasy bloggers
signaled on their blogs back in early September.

The political drama not only steers the focus away from this tragic event but
it makes one wonder who will be accountable for following up and taking charge
of the issue.

Joan asks simply: “[Have you heard of the Gulser
Ana](http://www.purplecorner.com/2009/09/11/have-you-heard-about-the-gulser-
ana/) ?”. In the comment section, [Capt Collin Smith explores the possible
causes](http://www.purplecorner.com/2009/09/11/have-you-heard-about-the-
gulser-ana/comment-page-1/#comment-2919) of the grounding:

Mialisoa [reports on her
blog](http://mialisenfout.hautetfort.com/archive/2009/10/29/faux-cap-en-
pleine-catastrophe-ecologique.html) that (fr):

> cutanées et diarrhéiques ». Car non seulement ces personnes ont été exposées

The locals suffer from respiratory problems, skin diseases and diarrhea. Not
only were the people exposed to toxic waste but the clean up was also
performed without adequate equipments and protective gears

The lack of report early on in the media prompted this reaction from [Tomavana
on twitter](http://twitter.com/tomavana/statuses/4943597952):

> “@fanjakely j'ai l'impression que les habitants Sud #Madagascar sont des

> #Solidaire”

“@fanajkely I have the impression that the people from the South of Madagascar
are considered 2nd class Malagasy citizens. I hear a lot of nice speeches but
we are not showing solidarity”

Unfortunately that was not the only source of worry in the region.

**Severe drought**

Rain has been very scarce in the Southern region. According to the Guardian,
the unseasonal dry weather caused by climate change (10% increase in
temperature) has prompted [a severe drought and warning signs of famine
](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/23/madagascar-drought)for the past
six months. Tovoheryzo Raobi Jaona explains how climate change [has affected
the
south](http://www.letemps.ch/Facet/print/Uuid/9d019fae-c7f7-11de-974e-cca0c3260e93/Vivement_un_cyclone_cest_mieux_que_de_subir_la_s%C3%A9cheresse)
(fr):

> “Avant, il y avait une sécheresse tous les dix ans. Or, depuis 2000, il y en
> a eu quatre”

“Before, a drought was observed every 10 years. Since 2000, there has been 4″

Féroce Remanongona, an elected official goes further [as to
say](http://www.letemps.ch/Facet/print/Uuid/9d019fae-c7f7-11de-974e-cca0c3260e93/Vivement_un_cyclone_cest_mieux_que_de_subir_la_s%C3%A9cheresse)
(fr):

> Nous prions le Grand Dieu que le cyclone passe chez nous. Même s’il détruit
> nos maisons, c’est mieux que subir la sécheresse

We pray God that a cyclone comes our way. Even if it destroys our homes, it's
better than facing the drought

This is a powerful statement when one recalls how the [recent cyclone
devastated the majority of the
region](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/25/madagascar-devastating-
tropical-storm-makes-way-for-a-political-one/).

The Panos Insitute recently published a series called [“Pushed to the
Edge”](http://www.panos.org.uk/pushedtotheedge) about the effect of climate
change on the Malagasy population in the Southern region. Here is a [testimony
from the report by Bruno](http://www.panos.org.uk/?lid=29210):

> I noticed that the weather had changed from our usual predictions, and the
> rainy seasons were starting very late… Not only was rice production
> affected, but also sweet potatoes and cassava. It was getting hotter and
> hotter, which made planting cassava challenging… When I harvested it, I
> discovered that the roots had become smaller, compared to my previous
> harvest. In terms of rice, I used to collect three to four large baskets and
> now I can harvest only one small basket. The change is so obvious that it
> makes me ask the question, “What is happening to the climate?”

A recent academic paper for the American Political Science Association by
Richard Marcus illustrates the [challenges of water resource
management](http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p58976_index.html) in the
Ambovombe-Androy region. The paper states that

> “Rural communities are suddenly faced with having to pay exorbitant costs
> for water. They are ill-prepared to carry out their municipal functions and
> unable to raise the level of user-fees or community taxes necessary to fund
> infrastructure development”

[Stephane](http://pakysse.wordpress.com), a blogger from [Foko Madagascar
](http://club.foko-madagascar.org/)attended the [UN conference on climate
change in September
](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2009/09/22/foko-bloggers-

challenges](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2009/09/30/malagasy-

developing countries like Madagascar.

Finally, a resolution to [condemn the plundering of natural resources in
Madagascar](http://news.mongabay.com/2009/1104-madagascar.html) has been
introduced by Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon) at the House of Representatives.
Illegal logging of precious woods from the rain forest has been increasing
with the political turmoil. Courier International and l'Express de Madagascar
also reveals that the government [allowed for exportation of precious
rosewood](http://tr.im/Efqf) in late September (fr). More details on the
illegal logging of the rain forest are available[
