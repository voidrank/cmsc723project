When the economies of world plummeted late last year, that “motherhood” would
be a victim of the spiraling trend might not have been foremost in the minds
of most. However, recent reports have indicated that mothers have ended up
being as much a casualty of the recession as the stock markets.

**Alternate Income**

According to _[Associated
Content](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/277958/single_mothers_are_turning_to_online.html)_
:

> With the extremely high cost of decent childcare in this country and the
> ongoing problem of women being unable to collect child support regularly,
> more and more single mothers are turning to prostitution in order to pay
> their bills and support themselves and their children.

The report states that the Internet has opened new doors for these ladies.
“Holly”, aged 25, was quoted as saying:

> My ex-husband was not paying child support for our four-year-old son, and I
> was getting desperate for money… I placed an ad on Yahoo looking for a
> sugar-daddy type of relationship and met a decent guy that was willing to
> help me out.

This has apparently become a trend in Japan. [_Japan Today_
reports](http://www.japantoday.com/category/kuchikomi/view/single-mothers-
squeezed-by-recession-turning-to-prostitution-as-last-resort):

> There are 1.23 million single-mother households in Japan, Health and Labor
> Ministry statistics show. Their average annual income, government benefits
> included, is 2.11 million yen—40% of the overall household average. A
> revised welfare law shrank entitlements in 2002. The current recession is
> choking off employment opportunities. For the 28-year-old woman Suzuki calls
> “Ruriko Kumata,” prostitution seems her only means of survival.

Not only mothers, single women are turning to prostitution or “hostess” jobs
in Japan. [News from _Ground
Report_](http://www.groundreport.com/World/Japanese-women-turn-for-club-jobs-
again/2904802) states that more young women are turning to “club jobs”, while
_[Nurse In Australia](http://www.nurseinaustralia.com/nurses-turn-to-
prostitution/)_ , a blog by a nurse in Australia, reports that nurses are
leaving the profession and turning to prostitution.

In response to [a

similar to these, _[Wandaphull
World](http://wandaphullworld.com/2008/11/24/desperate-women-are-turning-to-
prostitution-during-recession/),_ a blog ‘is dedicated to all the “REAL” women
of the world”, states:

**Thinking Twice About Motherhood**

Another effect the recession has had on motherhood is that many women are
reconsidering motherhood. [_Bester News_ reports from
Reuters](http://www.besternews.com/article/Bester%20News%20-%20Top%20News/Recession%20giving%20U.S.%20women%20pause%20about%20motherhood/):

A recent survey by the [Guttmacher Institute](http://www.guttmacher.org/)
echoes these sentiments, finding that “nearly two-thirds (64%) of US low- and
middle-income women of childbearing age say they cannot afford to have a baby
because of the current bad economy.”

**What Birth Control?**

The [Guttmacher Institute also found](http://www.care2.com/causes/womens-
rights/blog/birth/) that women are either forgoing birth control pills or else
purchasing cheaper contraceptives to save on cash during this economic
downturn. The _Women’s Rights blog_ at _Care2.com_ stated:

> The problem is, affordable birth control is not yet regarded as a

[Francine Huff on the _Wallet
Pop_](http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2009/05/19/recession-adoptions-economy-
forces-some-women-to-give-up-babies/), struggling families are now considering
giving away their babies because they cannot afford to bring the children up.
In addition, _Wallet Pop_ reports that adoption agencies claim there has been
an increase in inquiries from women who are considering giving their babies up
for adoption. With these as a few examples of how the recession has affected
motherhood, perhaps more will be done on the way back to recovery.
