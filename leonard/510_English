December 7, Iran's “Student Day” [16th of Azar] protests against student
repression in Iran will be organized around the world. Last year thousands of
protesters defied the Islamic regime by protesting during [Student
Day](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/06/iran-tensions-rise-as-student-
day-approaches/), chanting slogans against Ali Khamenei, the leader of the
Islamic Republic, and protesting the government's foreign policy. They also
chanted [“Where is my vote?”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Movement).

**Green call from London**

_[London Green Movement](http://www.greenmovementlondon.com/about-us)_ has
sent a mass email and invites to Londoners:

> 16 Azar has always been regarded as the symbol of Iranian student movement
> combating tyranny and demanding democracy and freedom since 1953,
> nevertheless each and every repressive attempt has been made, however
> unsuccessful, to silence the students’ voices by the dictator! Once again,
> we will gather to stand by Iranian students in their struggle for democracy
> and freedom, remembering those courageous souls who stood up for their
> rights and spoke out against brutal IRI repression and despotism, likes of
> Majid Tavakoli and over 70 other students who have been imprisoned ever
> since and many more who have been expelled from universities across Iran for
> practicing their right to freedom of speech and assembly!

And a YouTube video has been published on this occasion with a series of
photos from the Iranian protest movement.

**Protest of empty chairs**

_Politicsofresistance_ in the Netherlands[
writes](http://www.politicsofresistance.com/Where_is_my_classmate/Where_is_my_classmate.html):

> In response to the persistent harassment of Iranian students, we have held a
> protest of empty chairs at the Rietveld Academy of Art and Design in
> Amsterdam. Students would enter the building and see a class of empty
> chairs. Some of them would read the information and get on with their
> business. Others would also sit down and write something for a student in
> Iran. These messages will be sent to a few of them or their families.

This site has also published several photos (one above) and says:

> Around 100 students are currently in prison. Over 100 have been expelled and
> an unaccounted number have been banned from entering universities in IRAN.

**University is Alive**

_Abai_ , an Iranian blogger [says](http://aabeee.blogspot.com/2010/11/blog-
post_23.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+aabeeeblogspotcom+%28%D8%A2%D8%A8%DB%8C%29)
[fa] the plans for 16th of Azar show that the university is still alive
despite all wounds on its body. The blogger mentioned the name of several
jailed and persecuted bloggers, such as[ Majid
Tavakoli](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/12/iran-men-in-hijab-to-
support-jailed-student/).

On YouTube another video claims to show a gathering of students at Tehran
University chanting “Down with the dictator” on December 6.
