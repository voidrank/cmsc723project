Last week, eleven Serbian tourists spending their holidays in Tunisian resort
towns of [Sousse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousse) and
[Hammamet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammamet,_Tunisia) categorically
refused to leave this North African country before Thursday, Jan. 20, which
was supposed to be the final day of their tour. Because of [the emergency
situation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/), they had been offered to return to Belgrade with the last
Jat Airways flight last week, but after they refused, the Serbian Embassy
representatives told them they would be staying at their own risk, as the
Embassy could not guarantee any flights out of Tunisia on the day of their
scheduled departure.

Although the resorts are located at some distance from the Tunisian hot points
of political unrest, evacuation was recommended mostly because hotels were
closing for safety reasons, slowly running out of food and water.

Milica Cubrilo Filipovic, the Serbian Ambassador in Tunisia, did find herself
and her children in a truly dangerous situation, however: she said “bullets
whistled from all directions” during [the evacuation of her
children](http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/147834/Milica+%C4%8Cubrilo-
Filipovi%C4%87%3A+Jedva+sam+spasla+decu!.html). She had warned the Serbian
tourists of potential risks that they were exposed to as foreign citizens in
Tunisia.

The Embassy of Serbia helped to evacuate 11 Macedonian tourists, since
Macedonia has no embassy in Tunisia. One Russian woman with two small children
somehow happened to be among these evacuees.

Serbian tourists said to the [Serbian
media](http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/229680/Avion-sa-srpskim-turistima-iz-
Tunisa-sleteo-na-beogradski-aerodrom) they were satisfied with how the
Tunisians were protecting them. According to them, special forces were on the
roof of their hotel, while plainclothes police officers walked around outside.
The only problem they encountered was during their transfer to the
[Monastir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastir,_Tunisia) airport, when a
group of demonstrators threw stones at their bus. No one was injured, however.

Those tourists who agreed to return to Serbia were upset because their winter
holiday was prematurely terminated. A retired Serbian couple Dara and Mihajlo
Stancevic, for example,
[told](http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/147944/Penzioneri+iz+Loznice+te%C5%A1ka+srca+prekinuli+%E2%80%9Ezimovanje%22%21.html)
a Serbian newspaper that they they had been spending their winters in [Ben
Ali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali)‘s Tunisia for the
past seven years and liked it there, not only because of the excellent
climate, but also because the cost of living there was much lower than back
home in Serbia.

Describing the tourists’ mentality, she also explained :
