The video from the Peruvian television program _Reporte Semanal_ that shows an
[alpaca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpaca) named
[“Pisco”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisco) supposedly surfing, guided by
its trainer, Domingo Pianezzi, himself a surfer, has been attracting a lot of
attention. This [Reuters blog
post](http://blogs.reuters.com/photo/2010/03/16/surfing-alpaca-makes-waves/)
has several photographs of the surfing alpaca. The stunt is especially
interesting because the alpaca is an Andean animal from the South American
[camelid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelid) family and has a lot of hair
necessary to withstand the low temperatures in the Andean mountains. Even
though there is mention that before the arrival of the Spanish that the alpaca
could also be found on the coastal wetlands, it is difficult to imagine these
animals interacting with the ocean and with the high summer temperatures.

Those who have seen the video come away with the impression that the surfing
alpaca is not very comfortable, and it even jumps into the water when fear
takes over. This is different than [other ‘surfing’ animals, such as
dogs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JujbOPb-Zxg) that appear to enjoy the
experience even more. To judge for yourself, [see the video
[es].](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M2IqE0cNEg&feature=player_embedded)

For many in the beginning, the surfing alpaca was something praiseworthy or
something to proud of as Peruvians, as can be seen in the comments section of
[the story in the El Comercio newspaper
[es]](http://elcomercio.pe/noticia/446882/alpaca-surfista-sensacion-verano-
peruano). However, there were also comments against this stunt from those who
accuse the surfer of animal abuse. The same newspaper published another
article where animal-rights activists [express their concern for the well-
being of the alpaca [es]](http://elcomercio.pe/noticia/449050/alpacapisco-
agita-marea-polemica) because it was taken out of its natural habitat and was
in contact with salt water. The alpaca's trainer describes the safety steps
that are taken, such as plugging the animal's ears and rinsing it with
freshwater after being in the ocean.

However, for many those measures do not appear to be enough. In the blogs,
there are many voices that are in disagreement with this “sporting practice.”
For example, Roger Torres Pando writing in the blog _Perú Antitaurino [es]_[
writes](http://peruantitaurino.blogspot.com/2010/03/alpaca-es-humillada-y-
maltratada-por.html):

> Cabe señalar que este deportista, profesor de surf para niños, está violando
> la Ley Nº 27265, Ley de Protección a los Animales Domésticos y a los
> Animales Silvestres mantenidos en Cautiverio, así como el Artículo 450-A del

It should be noted that this athlete, surfing teacher for children, is
violating Law No. 27265, Law to Protect Pets and Wild Animals kept in
Captivity, as well as Article 450-A of the Civil Code. So what kind of
training could he be giving to future generations when he does not respect
animals and nature? Shouldn't have his parents, before teaching him how to
stand on a surfboard, teach him values to be better men? From here we call on
the Department of Flora and Fauna and the Environmental Police to rescue the
innocent alpaca from the clutches of this selfish “athlete”.

The blogger RBC also was not in agreement and writes in his blog _De Todo un
Poco…y que Dios nos Coja Confesados [es]_ and asks [Question: Who is more of
an animal?](http://rbcdetodounpoco.blogspot.com/2010/03/desafiante-quien-es-
mas-animal.html):

> A diferencia de un labrador retriever, una alpaca NO se lanza al mar a

Unlike a Labrador Retriever, an alpaca DOES NOT dive into the ocean to swim,
just look at its bended legs on top of the surfboard because it is scared of
being exposed to the ocean. However, Pianezzi says that his pet “is used to
the water”…. right, of course. It would be interesting to see this trainer
surf stark-naked in the Andes mountains..

In the blog _Tecnología [es]_ [the blogger
writes](http://chetecnologia.blogspot.com/2010/03/alpaca-surf.html):

> nos preguntamos que sentirá la protagonista de esta nota, solo podemos decir
> que se le ve mas echada en la tabla (como algunos principiantes) que como
> todo un surf y solo atina a caerse de la tabla que a correr la ola.

we wonder what would the main character of this story feel, all we can say
that it appears laying down on the surfboard (like some beginners) and only
manages to fall from the surfboard to ride the wave.

The blogger from _Interiorismo de Verdad [es]_ also
[reflects](http://interiorismodeverdad.blogspot.com/2010/03/la-alpaca-surfer-
llamada-pisco.html):

> (refiriéndose al perro NdE) Creo que la amistad del ser humano con los

(in reference to the surfing dog) I think the friendship between human beings
and animals is what we must nurture and teach and I think the trainer of San
Bartolo Domingo Pianezzi has developed a friendship with his pet, which he
taught to go to the beach with him and climb aboard the surfboard, which is an
example of impressive companionship, … but now comes news that the novelty of
the alpaca Pisco that would become his new surfing student, I think he is only
doing this to gain publicity because it does not seem appropriate for this
animal from a different habitat from the coastline must get used to the ocean,
and must be fleeced to avoid the heat from the coast, can you imagine that?

In Facebook, there are two groups [Pisco the Surfing
Alpaca](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#%21/pages/Pisco-the-Surfing-
Alpaca/369273193911) that appears to be in favor of the stunt and [Surfing
Alpaca? I would say animal abuse
[es]](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#%21/group.php?v=info&ref=search&gid=104081746288850).
The second El Comercio article mentioned contains a polls with the question
“Are you for or against the surfing alpaca?” At the time of publication there
is 43% in favor and 57% against.
