[Pink Tentacle](http://pinktentacle.com/2011/04/namazu-e-earthquake-catfish-
prints/) posted numerous images of namazu-e (“catfish pictures”), a type of
color woodblock print that became popular after the Great Ansei Earthquake,
which struck current day Tokyo in 1855. The mythology
[namazu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namazu_\(Japanese_mythology\)) and
earthquakes is still prevalent in contemporary Japanese culture; one such
example being the icon for the [iPhone
app](http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/id398954883?mt=8) that gives earthquake
warnings.
