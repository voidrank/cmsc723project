Yong Vui Kong, a 21 year old Malaysian, was convicted by Singapore's High
Court in 2008 of trafficking 42.27g of heroin and given the death sentence,
mandatory for offences involving more than 15g of the illegal substance. He
claimed that he was just a drug mule and was tricked into carrying the drugs.
He filed an appeal but told his lawyers later to withdraw it, one week before
the hearing in April.

In December last year, represented by Mr M. Ravi, he was given the chance to
file a new appeal. The Court of Appeal said it had a duty to hear new legal
arguments even after a criminal case had come to a close, especially if it
involved the death penalty.

Most bloggers are against the death penalty, pointing out that many countries
have done away with the death penalty and a teenager shouldn't be sentenced to
death.

He also argues that teens shouldn't pay the price for their ‘ignorance':
