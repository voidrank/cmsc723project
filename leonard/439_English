blogger-prosecuted-for-criticizing-local-mayor/mosina/)

Łukasz Kaprowicz, a journalist working for _Fakty Mosińsko-Puszczykowskie_ , a
local Polish newspaper, and a long-time author of the
[_Mosina.blox.pl_](http://mosina.blox.pl) blog, was sued for defamation after
he had criticized Zofia Springer, the mayor of
[Mosina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosina), in his blog posts.

As he writes on this [blog](http://mosina.blox.pl/2011/01/ZOSTALEM-
SKAZANY.html), the sentence he has received obliges him to:

>   1. not work in his profession for a year
>   2. pay 500 PLN fee to the Polish Red Cross
>   3. 10 months of limited freedom + 300 hours of community service
>   4. publish apologies in the local newspaper _Głos Wielkopolski_
>   5. cover the cost of psychological and psychiatric tests (3 items)
>

Bloggers and social media users are highly critical of the prosecution and are
defending the blogger. A special fan page on Facebook has been created:
[_Popieram Łukasza Kasprowicza skazanego za bloga. Stop cenzurze
władzy._](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Popieram-Lukasza-Kasprowicza-
skazanego-za-bloga-Stop-cenzurze-wladzy/195788340431713) (“I support sentenced
blogger Łukasz Kasprowicz – stop censorship.”)

Piotr Wajszczak [comments](http://www.piotrwajszczak.pl/komuno-wroc-czyli-
skazany-radny-i-bloger-z-mosiny/) on his blog:

On the other hand, [Piotr Vagla Waglowski](http://prawo.vagla.pl/node/9338), a
blogger who writes about the Internet and law, tries to define what the term
“press material” might mean for the judge and points out various scenarios in
which a blog can be named “press material” or not.

> If in fact Poznań's court sentenced the man for not doing his professional
> work as a journalist, that means that the judge thinks that self-publishing
> on an internet portal (on a “blog”, that is) is in fact doing this job.

Olgierd Rudak highlights [different aspect of the
case](http://olgierd.bblog.pl/wpis,bloger;skazany;na;zakaz;pisania;bloga,48502.html):

> The sentenced blogger not only ran for city council with a different
> committee than the Mayor, but he was writing for a local magazine – and not
> the _Merkuriusz Mosiński_ , which – suprise, surpise! but how typical –
> fully supports the mayor's actions. I think that we can say that the judge
> got somehow involved in a local “political honor” conflict.

Olgierd points out at the end:

> To sum it all up, I think we have the first Polish blogger who was banned by
> a judge to write his blog.
