The National Police Agency has recently released the results of its annual
survey on suicide in Japan. According to the [official
statistics](www5.cao.go.jp/seisakukaigi/shiryou/0028-100427/pdf/item03.pdf)
[ja, pdf], 32,845 people committed suicide last year and dramatic is the
increase in number of victims in their 20s and 30s; [the main reasons
](http://www.asahi.com/national/gallery_e/view_photo.html?national-
pg/0513/TKY201005130202.jpg) [ja] are said to be 1) health problems, 2)
economic and social problems, 3) family problems.

Sadly known as one of the developed countries with one of [the highest per
capita number of
suicides](http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/number-of-suicides-
stays-above-30000-for-12th-straight-year) [en], Japan has been trying for
years to confront the problem, by working to tackle it at all levels of
society. The government and other groups constantly launch campaigns to raise
awareness and invite people to turn to assistance centers whenever they feel
depressed or convinced that the only way to solve their, or often their loved
ones, problems is to commit suicide.

Deciding to talk to somebody, reflecting and defining the causes of their
desperation, is a very hard step that few people in a state of depression are
believed to be able to make. But, although it cannot represent a definitive
solution, some believe that the internet might be a tool to help, especially
among the tech-savvy, younger generations.

To this regard, Twitter has been recently a subject of debate of those who see
in its 140 word format a potential for contact with those who seek help but
prefer to remain anonymous and cannot express their suffering in long and well
articulated phrases.

[Yamabe](http://yamabe.biz/375) says that the
[news](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/03/moore.twitter.threat/index.html)
[en] that actress Demi Moore reportedly prevented a woman from committing
suicide by tweeting a 16-word-long comment recently made him reflect on the
question.

> 考えてみたんだけど、案外自殺予防とツイッターって相性が良いのかもしれない  
>  まず、ツイッターはゆるい関係が主体なので、書き込みがしやすいというのがある  
>  このことは何を意味するかというと、ちょっと人生が嫌になって実際に自殺はしないのだけど  
>  心が折れてしまってこのまま消えてしまいたいそんな気持ちをもツイッターでつぶやきやすいということだ  
>  つまり自殺予防だけではなく、その前の段階（死んでしまいたい気持ち）に至るのをも防ぐことができるということだ  
>  絶望から来る自殺なら、ツイッターでそれをつぶやけば  
>  案外自分は一人ではないと気がつくかもしれない……

I gave it some thought and realized that actually suicide prevention and
Twitter could be a good match.  
First of all; the relationships through Twitter are more casual, which makes
writing easier. When feelings first surface that life is disappointing or
depressing without going so far as to want to end it, this is a point where
that feeling could be tweeted – feeling that one simply can't go on and that
perhaps it would be better to disappear from this world.  
Therefore, it could be possible to apply Twitter not only for actual suicide
prevention but also to inhibit the birth of that previous stage, the thought
of wanting to die. For suicides that result from utter despair, if one can
tweet the desperation, maybe it will help to realize that one is not alone….

Many have tried to give
[insight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_Japan) [en] into such a
complex issue, trying to analyze the sociological implications that the ‘act
of suicide’ has in Japan, where traditionally it used to be considered as a
brave act at times. Not only in the samurai culture but also in the rural one,
where often the o[lder people decided to ‘retire’ themselves in the
mountains](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/2862051.stm)
[en] instead of being a burden to their families.

But the fact that the number of victims is not likely to decrease, can only
mean that the causes are difficult to identify, and some bloggers, like
[Ayasan](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/a068805/e/f9df46c6594281c8da607670ffb9ab57),
are skeptical about the power of Twitter and the Internet in general.

> ツイッターやチャット、相手の素性を知らず（こちらの素性も知られず）に、リアルタイムでやり取りをする方法は沢山あります。  
>  勿論、然るべきルートで然るべき方法をとれば、「PCの向こう側の個人」を特定することはできるけど、リアルタイムではほぼ無理。  
>  そういう状況の中で、フリーにアクセスできてしまうツールで、「命」を扱う事、私はとても危うい事だと思います。[…]  
>  過去の記事に、「言葉は人を殺す事ができる」という内容の記事を書いた事があります。  
>  言葉の選び方、漢字の使い方、文のニュアンス…  
>  「あちら側との狭間」に立つ人は、「言い回しひとつ」に過剰に反応し、簡単に決行してしまう。  
>  PCを通して向かい合っている（つもり）の相手が、「善意の人」だと言い切れますか？  
>  インターネットでの繋がり程度で、「死にたい程の孤独」が紛れると本気で考えてるとしたら、相当オメデタイか、想像力が欠如してると思うよ？

There are many ways to deal with each other in real time, such as using
Twitter or a chat room, where you don't know who the other one is nor do they
know who you are. Of course it may be technically possible to identify the
individual behind the PC but in real time, it's almost impossible. Which is
why in such circumstances, I think it's very dangerous that someone's life can
be handled with a tool that allows such free interchange. […]
