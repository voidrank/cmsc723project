The Indian ambassador to the United States [Meera
Shankar](http://www.washdiplomat.com/ambprof/India.html) was pulled from a
security line at the Jackson-Evers International Airport in Mississippi, USA,
and was subsequently forced to undergo a pat-down body search by a [Transport
Security Administration](http://www.tsa.gov/) (TSA) agent. On December 4, 2010
Shankar was about to board a flight to Baltimore after attending a Mississippi
State University programme and although she did not set off the airport's
metal detectors, [she was singled
out](http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2010/12/india-diplomat-gets-
humiliating-pat-down-at-mississippi-
airport-/134197/5?csp=outbrain&csp=obnetwork) on grounds that she was wearing
a sari, India's national dress. She mentioned her diplomatic status, but it
did not stop the ordeal in front of the other passengers. Last September,
Shankar underwent a similar pat-down in Chicago.

The incident sparked strong protests from India. Indian Foreign Secretary
_Nirupama Rao_ [said](http://www.indiatalkies.com/2010/12/patdown-search-
meera-shankar-good-public-diplomacy-nirupama-rao.html) that the incident is
not good public diplomacy shown by USA and India's Foreign Minister S.M.
Krishna [reiterated]() that this is unacceptable to India. Indian opposition
party BJP has [demonstrated](http://www.teluguone.com/news/2010/12/11/bjp-
demands-us-apology-for-frisking-meera-shankar/) near the US Embassy in India
demanding apology from US. The blogosphere is also buzzing with reactions as
details are emerging.

There were mixed responses from the US authorities. The US Department Of State
has reached out to the ambassador
[regretting](http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/americas/US-regrets-pat-
down-of-envoy-Meera-Shankar/Article1-636609.aspx) the incident. However,
according to [news
sources](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/12/09/2010-12-09_india_protests_against_sariclad_envoy_meera_shankar_tsa_patdown_at_airport.html#ixzz17fEx70p8),
TSA defended their action mentioning that diplomats are not exempted from the
searches and that Shankar was “screened in accordance with TSA's security
policies and procedures”. It may be mentioned here that not all passengers are
subject to pat downs, only [those passengers who set off the metal
alarm](http://www.panasianbiz.com/world-news/meera-shankar-secondary-
screening-regretted-by-us/) have to go through the screening, and “Ms. Shankar
had passed through the metal frame without setting off the alarm”. The US
border search exception rule
[asserts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_search_exception) that the
officer must have reasonable suspicion or prior information to believe the
search will reveal threat or contraband, and may have to have a higher
standard or court-reviewed warrant for some of the more invasive searches.

The ambassador visibly felt humiliated as she was searched openly, inside a
transparent booth. _Pavani_ at _Sepia Mutiny_

The incident shows the ignorance about the
[Sari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari), the national outfit of many South
Asian countries which is worn by millions of women in this region and all over
the world. A comment at
[NYDailyNews.com](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/12/09/2010-12-09_india_protests_against_sariclad_envoy_meera_shankar_tsa_patdown_at_airport.html)
perhaps shows how many Americans feel about Sari:

> Wear the garb of a terrorist and you should expect to be searched. Good work
> TSA.

_Bhai_ [wonders](http://bhai-just-a-few-words.blogspot.com/2010/12/pat-down-
searches.html):
