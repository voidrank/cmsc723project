Anime director Satoshi Kon died of pancreatic cancer on August 24th, and the
world lost a visionary creator. He was 46 years old. As [
jbetteridge](http://twitter.com/jbetteridge/statuses/22026299183) tweeted:

> It's not that anime will never be the same with Satoshi Kon gone. It's now
> much more likely that anime will always be the same.

Kon's wife published his last words, [“ _Sayonara_
(Farewell)”](http://konstone.s-kon.net/modules/notebook/archives/565), on his
website on the 25th. It is a lengthy post that starts with how he and his wife
were told in May that Kon had six months to live, and chronicles his decision
to greet his fate in his own home, a near death experience, the love and
support of his wife, colleagues and friends, and his unfinished film _Yume
Miru Kikai_ (The Dream Machine).

Writer Makiko Itoh [translated the entire
article](http://makikoitoh.com/journal/satoshi-kons-last-words) on her blog,
saying:

Here are some excerpts:

Itoh [tweeted](http://twitter.com/makiwi/status/22332107223) that there is [a
German translation](http://noushi.org/2010/08/26/satoshi-kons-

posted [Further language and cultural notes regarding Satoshi Kon's last
words](http://makikoitoh.com/journal/further-language-and-cultural-notes-
regarding-satoshi-kons-last-words).

Satoshi Kon's last message made the rounds in the Twittersphere as his message
resonated with legions of fans.
[@SAKAI_Kenzi](http://twitter.com/SAKAI_Kenzi/statuses/22335339110):

> 先日亡くなった今 敏監督、余命宣告を受けていたんですね。オフィシャルサイトKON'S
> TONEの、長い長い最後の投稿を読んで、自分の死に冷静に向き合う姿勢に目頭が熱くなった。「死ぬための準備」僕にはできそうにない。http://bit.ly/asvCKo

I hadn't realized that director Satoshi Kon had known that his days were
numbered. I read his long, long, final message on his official site, KON's
TONE. His stoic stance on facing his own death made me tear up. Preparing to
die… I don't think I can do this.

[@KatsumiKuga](http://twitter.com/Kuga/statuses/22335123403):

> 再度、今敏監督の最後の日記を読む。
> 死にゆく者の達観にも圧倒されるが、監督を取り巻く群像の描写と、それにより今敏の死というシーンが鮮やかに立ち上がってくることに改めて衝撃を受ける。最後の最後まで表現者だったのだな。遠く及ばずながら、願わくは俺もそのように生き、死にたい。

I read Satoshi Kon's last entry again. The philosophy of a dying man is
impressive enough, but it's the vivid way in which “Satoshi Kon's death” as a
scene is protrayed that makes such an impact on me. He really was a creator
until the very end. I can only hope to live and die like he did.

[@dienojibigboss](http://twitter.com/dienojibigboss/status/22346213768),
referring to one of @konsatoshi's
[tweets](http://twitter.com/konsatoshi/status/21414831553):

> 故今敏監督は亡くなる一週間前にツイッターで「でも、やるんだよ」とつぶやいていた。涙がとまらんよ。俺も絶対頑張ろう。どんなツラいことがあっても
> 「でも、やるんだよ」

One week before the late Satoshi Kon passed away, he tweeted “even then, do
it”. I can't stop crying. I swear, I shall also do my best. No matter how hard
things get…. “even then, do it”.

One of Kon's best known works is
[Paprika](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851578/), a film that explores the
intersection of dreams and reality, released in 2006. Giving a brief overview
of Kon's movies, [James Leung](http://raiwebs.blogspot.com/2010/08/satoshi-
kon-dreamer.html) writes:

> When Paprika was released, Kon was reaching the zenith of his powers as a

watched Paprika over the weekend:

>
> 「パプリカ」鑑賞終了。ほんとにすごい作品。今敏監督の作品て意識的に理解するというより、無意識の領域で「わかる」ようなかんじ。現実と虚構が入り交じる現代社会、情報の波に踊らされてしまうのは至極当然。でもたまには立ち止まって「大事なモノってなんだっけ？」自分に問いかけるのもまた一興か

I just finished watching “Paprika”. It's a truly amazing film. I think
director Satoshi Kon's movies are about unconsciously understanding the
unstated, rather than deliberately analyzing what is expressed. In a
contemporary society where reality and fiction mingle, it's natural to become
lost in an ocean that's rocking with waves of information. Sometimes though,
it's important to stop for a while and ask yourself, “What is really
important?”.

Ohagi at Anipression, a group blog for anime bloggers,
[remembers](http://anipression.blogo.jp/archives/51018235.html) the first time
he saw a Kon film and says farewell.

> 「PERFECT
> BLUE」は当時衝撃を受けました。今でも見終えた後の放心感は覚えています。。当時（1998年）色々なアニメを見ているうちに「アニメーションの表現には大きな可能性があるのではないか」なんて考えていました。そんな時に緻密な描写とその描写・表現の革新性や演出力を見せつけた本作はまさに「新しいアニメーションの可能性」を感じさせてくれた作品でした。この人の動向はチェックしなければいけない。そんな事を感じさせてくれました

Watching “[PERFECT BLUE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Blue)” was such
an eye-opening experience for me. I still remember being dazed after watching
the film. At that time (1998), I was watching a lot of anime and thinking that
animation as a medium for expression had great possibilities. And the
elaborateness of detail and the freshness of the visual storytelling that was
so powerful in the film was exactly what I was looking for in terms of “the
possibilities of new anime”. I remember thinking that I should keep an eye on
this director.

While most animated films are based on books or are film adaptations of
popular TV series, Satoshi Kon created anime that was dependent on personal
ingenuity for the past ten years. He is not only “number one”, but the “only
one”. I think this is what attracted talent like [musician] [Susumu
Hirasawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Hirasawa) and other wonderful
animators, and led to the consistent release of works with incredible quality.
That we are going to lose the ambitious, innovative direction that Kon
envisioned for anime makes me so sad.
