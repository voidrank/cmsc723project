December 17th is the[ International Day to End Violence Against Sex
Workers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_to_End_Violence_Against_Sex_Workers),
a day which started in 2003 as a memorial and vigil to the Sex workers killed
in Seattle Washington and then evolved to an international day to call
attention to the hate crimes committed against sex workers throughout the
world.

Some of this violence is related to stigmatization and the immediate
association many do between sex-workers and AIDS. Women in
[SANGRAM,](http://www.sangram.org/) an NGO in India, are working for that
association to be a positive one, where sex workers are known for their work
in preventing HIV/ AIDS and raising awareness.

The International Woman's Health Coalition recently visited SANGRAM to do
media training and documentation and this is [the short documentary film they
made](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hut0z3qoTPg). You can also see some of
the pictures[ they took during the documentation process
here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/iwhc/sets/72157622241143059/). As producer
@AudaciaRay [mentioned on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/audaciaray/status/6767128825):

> The US sex worker movement has a lot to learn from Indian activists. Watch
> my video to see how they're collectivizing…

In the video, the women of SANGRAM explain how education regarding their human
rights has made them take action to ensure that they receive proper medical
care, that they are treated equally by law enforcement and government
officials, that they protect themselves and so they can educate others
regarding the risks of STDs and unprotected sex. From the description:

> Based in a rural community in India's Maharashtra State, SANGRAM works to
> ensure equal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support:
> Over 6,000 women in rural India have participated in HIV testing as a result
> of these efforts. Drawing on 15 years of work to empower marginalized
> communities to claim their rights, SANGRAM is becoming an increasingly
> strong advocate nationally, and globally for health policies and programs
> that are responsive to the real-life needs of local communities.

In Australia, Juicy Jessie Abraham who works in a “legal” setting in the
Northern Territories [makes a vlog entry calling to abolish registration of
sex workers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fY2RjgjeDc). She wishes for
stigmatization against sex workers to stop, and she believes registration is a
way to identify sex workers and possibly use it to discriminate against them,
among other issues.

From [Grit TV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBBjFyyPb4Y), a short video
explains what is the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers and
its history, as well as the importance of the red umbrella symbolizing
resistance to discrimination against sex workers :

There are other organizations for whom sex work itself is equivalent to
violence. They wish to combat legalization and decriminalization by
eradicating sex work and criminalizing the purchase of sexual services. For
example, that is the position that [Honour
Consulting](http://www.honourconsulting.com/honours-history) in Canada holds.
Founded by former sex worker Trisha Baptie who also was a founding member for
EVE- formerly Exploited Voices now Educating, they have posted a song called
Would you Wait where they put out their perspective. In Ms. Baptie's words:

> We need to call prostitution what it really is, which is violence against
> women.  
>  Calling it violence against women, and an attack on women's equality,
> allows us to name the injustice that we have to fight against.  
>  Supporting the criminalization of the demand of prostitution, which is
> referred to as the Swedish model of law, or as of late, the Nordic model of
> law, which calls for an end of the commodification of women's bodies, is pro
> women and pro equality.

In a contrasting perspective from Macedonia, [Witness.org
](http://www.witness.org/)and the [Hops organization in
Skopje](http://www.hops.org.mk/), have produced the following 18 minute
documentary about sex work titled [_You Must Know About Me: Rights Not
Violence for Sex Workers in
Macedonia_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXhyzUya9BE). In it, sex workers
speak out firsthand about what it is like to live in an environment where they
are targeted, their human rights are overlooked and they are abused by the
figures of authority who should be protecting them, and where they wish to be
recognized as workers, with the same rights as any other consenting adult in
employment, where the problem with sex work is not the work itself, but the
stigmatization, insecurity and violence they face because of persecution and
discrimination.

From the video description:

> You Must Know About Me is a first-hand account of sex workers experiences
> and aspirations off and on the streets. While dealing with harassment and
> violence from clients, pimps, and the police, sex workers strive to counter
> hostile public attitudes by speaking out and fighting for their rights. The
> video calls for zero tolerance of violence against sex workers and the
> coordinated response of institutions to the actual needs of sex workers.

Do you know of any other activities or initiatives to end violence against sex
workers? Please let us know!
