**UPDATE (March 17):** Josef Oehmen's original post (linked below) has been
removed by Jason Morgan, apparently at the author's request. The post has been
[edited significantly and republished](http://mitnse.com/2011/03/13/modified-
version-of-original-post/) at the Nuclear Science and Engineering Blog at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Oehmen's original post reflected
the situation at the time – when only one of the Fukushima reactors was
experiencing problems. His comments about the potential release of
radioactivity have been removed in the revised post. Jason Morgan's original
post now conveys a message from Dr. Oehmen directing readers to the MIT blog:

> The version on mitnse.com is the most accurate, and as you can tell in many

Science bloggers at nature.com's [The Great
Beyond](http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/) continue to monitor the
situation very closely, including Geoff Brumfiel, who has provided periodic
updates on radiation levels both near the damaged reactor and at various
distances from it. His [March
17](http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/03/update_8_water_on_fukushima_fu.html)
post includes the following:

> NHK also [reports elevated radiation
> levels](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/17_26.html) around Fukushima
> prefecture. At Fukushima City, 65 km northwest of the plant and well outside
> the evacuation zone, authorities reported levels as high as 13.9 μSv/hr

> for more about the numbers).

There has unquestionably been a high demand for quick and accurate information
– both about specific radiation levels and how to put those levels in their
appropriate context. On March 16, Brumfiel tried to assess what the levels of
radiation meant for the public:

_[original post begins below.]_

The horror of Friday 11 March's [earthquake and resulting
tsunami](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/japan-earthquake-
tsunami-2011/) near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, soon gave way to
widespread panic as explosions rocked the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
However, one community in the blogosphere seemed to be more measured in
response to events unfolding at Fukushima – science bloggers.

Barry Brooks of _bravenewclimate_ republished [a lengthy
post](http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/03/13/fukushima-simple-explanation/)
written by Josef Oehmen, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and originally published by [Jason
Morgan](http://morgsatlarge.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/why-i-am-not-worried-
about-japans-nuclear-reactors/). Brooks and Morgan are supporters of nuclear
power, and consider the mainstream coverage of the nuclear power plant
“partial meltdown” to be overblown and full of errors. Oehmen gives his
thoughts based only on what he has read in the media, but immediately seeks to
put people at ease:

> There was and will *not* be any significant release of radioactivity.

> By “significant” I mean a level of radiation of more than what you would
> receive on – say – a long distance flight, or drinking a glass of beer that
> comes from certain areas with high levels of natural background radiation.

**Serious, but overhyped**

Echoing Dr. Oehmen's concerns that the situation at Fukushima is serious but
still overhyped, David Ropeik writes a post at the [_Scientific American Guest
Blog_](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=beware-the-fear-of-
nuclearfear-2011-03-12). He notes that the situation at the nuclear plant in
Fukushima has been compared in the media not only to Chernobyl (in the
Ukraine), but also the World War Two atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in Japan:

> We know from studying the survivors of those bombings, who were bathed in
> horrific doses of high level radiation – far worse than anything that could
> come from the Daiichi plant (or that came out of Chernobyl) – that ionizing
> radiation from nuclear energy is a carcinogen, but a relatively weak one.

Ropeik lists nuclear power interests among his clients, and disclosed this
fact in the post.

Also at the _Scientific American Guest Blog_ , Rita King [provides a valuable
primer](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=failure-of-
imagination-can-be-deadl-2011-03-12) on what a “nuclear meltdown” really is
and explains some of the differences between this incident and Chernobyl. She
also notes the often intractable views between nuclear power's supporters and
its critics:

> Opinions around nuclear energy tend to be binary, with industry proponents
> acting as if nothing could possibly go wrong while critics, terrified of
> nuclear apocalypse, remain convinced that old nuclear plants are time bombs.

Sharon Astyk of ScienceBlogs.com's [_Causabon's
Book_](http://scienceblogs.com/casaubonsbook/2011/03/inconceivable_why_failure_shou.php)
notes this attitude and suggests that this incident should have been foreseen
and that contingency planning must play a greater role in our decisions:

> I keep thinking about the word “inconceivable” in relationship to the
> terrible events in Japan – the earthquake, now upgraded to a 9, the
> subsequent tsunami and the nuclear events. As Nicole Foss's work has made
> clear, the Fukushima nuclear disaster is not a black swan – it follows on
> the heels of long warnings about the danger of building plants in such
> seismically sensitive places, and also after safety concerns within the
> plant itself. We know that the plant was not designed to handle such a major
> earthquake.

**Nuanced conversation**

Science bloggers continue to have a nuanced conversation about the merits of
nuclear power. Leading the discussion are _Scienceblogs.com's_ Mike the Mad
Biologist and James Hrynyshyn. Both bloggers step away from the hyperbole in
the current coverage and try to compare the benefits of nuclear power to other
steps societies could take to increase energy supply and decrease demand.

[Mike the Mad
Biologist](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2011/03/a_defense_of_nuclear_power_as.php)
suggests the nuclear industry move to develop an alternative form of nuclear
power that uses thorium instead of uranium -while thorium creates several
scientific challenges, it leaves less nuclear waste and is more abundant. He
also notes that people in the United States need to make some radical changes
in the way they live their lives to make large-scale energy conservation
possible:

> One of the best ways to reduce the amount of stuff we have to light on fire
> is to move from single detached housing in areas with no efficient mass
> transit to apartments with access to mass transit (keep in mind that
> residential use and transporation account for about two-thirds of total
> energy consumption). In other words, we have to massively ‘desuburbanize’
> and simultaneously ‘reurbanize.’

Since this scenario seems highly unlikely, Mike the Mad Biologist calls
nuclear power “a second best option.”

[Hrynyshyn](http://scienceblogs.com/classm/2011/03/the_fukushima_legacy.php)
suggests it's more appropriate to compare nuclear power with other
“alternative” power options:

> I'd rather we compared nuclear's risk and benefits against those of clean
> renewables. What's the worst-case scenario for a thermal solar power plant?
> Even a wind farm engineer's most terrifying nightmare seems like a powder
> compared with nuclear technology.
