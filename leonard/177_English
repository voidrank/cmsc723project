Laden](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/the-death-of-osama-bin-
laden/).**_

As news of United States (US) Special Forces’ targeted killing of Osama Bin
Laden was broadcast around the world, netizens in Mexico tweeted and blogged
their responses to this signal event in the “war on terror.” Tellingly, in the
vast majority of cases their language invoked the “war on drugs” that has been
imposed on them by their own government since 2006.

With the tactical deployment of analysis, analogies, irony and hashtags,
Mexicans put their own indelible stamp on an event with global ramifications.

On Twitter, users based in Mexico telegraphed the relevance of Bin Laden and
the US-led “war on terror” to their own troubled circumstances. Abraham SC
(@[abraham_360](http://twitter.com/#%21/abraham_360/status/64894095369306112)),
for example, drew a crisp analogy with [Joaquín Guzmán
Loera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Guzm%C3%A1n_Loera), head of
the Sinaloa drug cartel:

> #OsamaBinLaden es para USA lo que para #Mexico lo es el #ChapoGuzman

#OsamaBinLaden is for the USA what #ChapoGuzman is for #Mexico

Speculating on the temporal horizons involved, Victor Girón
(@[victor_giron](http://twitter.com/#%21/victor_giron/status/64890857828007936))
posed an open question:

> Si #EUA se tardo 10 anos en capturar a #OsamabinLaden, Cuanto tiempo tardara
> #Mexico en capturar a los mas buscados traficantes de #mx

If it took the USA 10 years to capture #OsamaBinLaden, how long will it take
#Mexico to capture the most wanted traffickers of #mx

([@mari3_1416](http://twitter.com/#%21/mari33_1416/status/64896234904756224))
struck a tone both wistful and ironic:

> Es oficial, #osamabinladen esta muerto! Ojala y en #Mexico tuvieramos un
> objetivo tan claro.

It's official, #osamabinladen is dead! I wish that we in #Mexico had such a
clear objective.

Valencia
(@[ViCoValEnCiA](http://twitter.com/#%21/ViCoValEnCiA/status/64896601348513794)),
[http://twitter.com/#!/ViCoValEnCiA] wrote skeptically – and with some
apprehension – about the timing of the US strike on Abbottabad:

> Que coincidencia que matan a #OsamaBinLaden cuando #Obama inicia su campana
> de reeleccion y en #Mexico a quien matarian!!!????

What a coincidence that they kill #OsamaBinLaden just as #Obama begins his re-
election campaign and in #Mexico who are they going to kill!!!????

A tweet by Alex Alan
(@[alan_weasley](http://twitter.com/#%21/alan_weasley/status/64899314757009408)),
saturated in black humor, made tacit reference to the mass graves recently
unearthed in Tamaulipas state:

> A #OsamaBinLaden lo encontraron descuartizado en una fosa en San Fernando,
> eso de la mansion en Pakistan es puro pedo! ;) #mexico #tampico

They found #OsamaBinLaden dismembered in a grave in San Fernando, the stuff
about the mansion in Pakistan is pure crap! ;) #mexico #tampico

With more characters at their disposal, bloggers were in a position to expand
on the complex sentiments briefly signaled on Twitter. Writing for [_The Mex
Files_](http://mexfiles.net/2011/05/01/we-champs-and-now-osam/), Richard
Grabman (a US-born resident of Mazatlan) posted under the title “‘We are the
champions'…and now? On Osama Bin Ladin and Mexico”:

> The government here, at the behest of the United States, targeted – and
> killed – any number of supposedly indispensable men in generic evil-doing
> business. While there's a tendency to give these groups inappropriate names

> “Transnational Criminal Organizations,” the Mexican fight has been against a

> Every time some “drug king-pin” has been blown away we're told it's an

A day after news of Bin Laden's death was broadcast, [_Blog El
5antuario_](http://el5anto.blogspot.com/2011/05/en-mexico-se-le-presta-mas-
atencion-al.html) [es] published the post “En Mexico se le presta mas atencion
al asesinato de osama bin laden que a cualquier asesinato en mexico” (”In
Mexico more attention is paid to the murder of Osama Bin Laden than to any
murder in Mexico”). Writing anonymously, the blogger began with an anecdote,
and wound up with an argument for the singularity of the Mexican instance:

> Hoy paso la peor estupidez en la television mexicana, en Televisa
> transmitian el programa pequenos gigantes todo iba bien era una transmision
> normal cuando interrumpen transmisiones (me imagino que todas las
> televisoras paso lo mismo) para decir “Osama Bin Ladin ha muerto.” OK
> ustedes diran, “bueno pues es Bin Laden.” pero sinceramente, cuantas

Today the worst stupidity happened on Mexican television. Televisa was
broadcasting the program “Small Giants”, all was well, it was a normal
transmission, when they interrupted the broadcast (I imagine all the networks
showed the same thing) to say “Osama Bin Laden is dead.” OK, you will say,
“well, it is Bin Laden.” But honestly, how many people die every day in
Mexico? Honestly, I wish that every time they murder a Mexican, whether it is
a hit-man, a drug dealer, a rapist, a soldier, a federal police officer, a
municipal police officer, or simply a person who just stepped into the street
and got caught in the crossfire (you see how things happen here in Mexico), I
wish that every time a Mexican is murdered they would interrupt the
programming on Televisa, TV Azteca and say “Today 10 Mexicans were murdered”
and dedicate at least 1 minute of attention to them on the news, but sadly
everyone knows this will never happen, thanks to the [Merida] initiative the
death of 1 person is more important than the deaths of 10, 20, 30 or even 100
Mexicans. Sadly this happens only in Mexico. So it is more advisable to look
for true information on the Internet.
