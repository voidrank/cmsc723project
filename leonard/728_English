Amidst the protests of [right-wing groups that opposed to the screening
](http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201006040405.html) [en] of the Oscar-winning
documentary “[The Cove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cove_\(film\))” [en],
three theaters decided not to show it.

The controversial movie which records the slaughter of dolphins in the inlet
of Taiji, a small village on the Southern Coast of Japan and historically
dependent on whaling, [was set to be screened
](http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/the-cove-to-be-
screened-in-japan-from-june) [en] in Japanese cinemas at the end of June.  
But, after threatening calls and protests in front of the distribution
company, two cinemas in Tokyo and one in Osaka declined to screen it. Another
twenty three will still screen it, but on a yet to be defined date.

The documentary has been harshly criticized in Japan as ‘anti-Japanese’ by
many, although very few have had the opportunity to watch it.  
Its reputation preceded it and it became known as the infamous movie where a
group of Americans land in Japan, then proceed to outwit the local fishermen
and criticize Japanese traditions.

Blogger at [Ki ni naru nikki](http://h43mjax1.blog130.fc2.com/blog-
entry-1.html) says he realizes the reasons for the protest.

> 日本人は一般的にいるかの肉を食べいないもの。。。  
>  ザコーヴへ抗議が殺到するのも、分かります。。。  
>  でもちょっと、見たいかな。。。ザコーヴの書籍でも読もうかな。

I can understand those who protest against “The Cove”…  
because the Japanese people normally don't eat dolphin meat … but I'd be a
little curious to watch it …  
maybe I'll read the book.

So far the only screening of “The Cove” was at the Tokyo International Film
Festival (TIFF) in November, though [it was initially
rejected](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3i54adc2f71aebbaa4cdcb541500eaa31d)
[en].  
In the film, made with high-tech equipment such as camouflaged high-definition
cameras, anti-dolphin-hunting activists secretly documented the slaughter of
dolphins and the black market of dolphin meat sold as whale meat. They also
highlighted the dangers of mercury, well known in Japan since the so called
[Minimata incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamata_disease) [en],
contained in the dolphin meat.

Blogger at
[umikarahajimaru](http://umikarahajimaru.at.webry.info/201003/article_15.html),
who saw the film at the TIFF, criticizes it for its biased and overly
emotional tone. In his opinion this makes it more of an activist-authored
movie rather than a journalistic style documentary.

> それはともかく、私が残念だと思うのは、太地町のことでも、この映画の作り手のことでもなくて、この映画の受け手のこと、つまり、こんな論理性もなく、具体的な論拠も証拠も示せずに、観客の情緒に訴えかけることで共感を得ようとするような、ドキュメンタリー映画とも言えないような代物を、最優秀ドキュメンタリー賞に選ぶアメリカ人が非常に多いことです。

What I criticize most about the film is not the fact that it talks about what
happens in Taiji, nor who made it but those who watched it. In other words,
the fact that many Americans awarded best documentary to a film which in my
opinion can't even be called a documentary. It tries to appeal to the viewer's
feelings and gain their sympathy without showing any concrete evidence and is
also lacking in logic.

It seems that people in Taiji would like to have ‘The Cove’ pulled from
theaters but, because it could look like they are trying to hide something
bad, it may have the opposite effect and the number of Japanese who are
interested in watching it may increase. If they were to let it go and the
movie was screened, it might be that a rumor that ‘it's a terrible movie’ will
spread and all this buzz will disappear in the blink of an eye.

However, the threatened actions by the rightist activists won’t let Japanese
people remain indifferent. Some liken it to 2008 when the documentary
‘[YASUKUNI](http://www.meniscuszine.com/issue23/subwaycinema2008/yasukuni20080705/index.html)‘
[en] (about the Yasukuni Shrine) was [similarly
pulled](http://www.japanprobe.com/2008/04/20/rightist-groups-dont-like-
yasukuni-documentary/) [en] because it was branded as ‘anti-Japanese’.

At the time some 55 Japanese intellectuals, journalists and film directors
declared themselves to be against the cancellation of the screening. Appealing
to the principle of freedom of expression, they released a common statement
which said they were against the censorship of the film and supported those
cinemas and people who were targets of the threatened action.

_renjakudo_ shares [ the text of the statement](http://yourry.cocolog-
nifty.com/renjakudo/2010/06/post-90f6.html) on his blog.

> こういう事態が一般化すると、評価が分かれるような問題作というべき映画は上映できないことになってしまいます。そもそも海外では広く公開されているこの映画が、作品で描かれた当事国の日本で公開できないというのは、日本における「言論表現の自由」がいかに脆弱かを示す事柄といえましょう。

If such episodes become normal, eventually it will become impossible to screen
any controversial movie that may divide public opinion. The fact that a movie
like this, which has been widely released abroad and features Japan cannot be
screened in Japan itself shows, just how fragile ‘freedom of expression’ is in
this country.
