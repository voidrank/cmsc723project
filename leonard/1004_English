She is British, blond, slim and cute. Her name is [Beckii Cruel
](http://www.tkma.co.jp/tjc/j_pop/beckii/)[ja] and, at age 14, has become an
idol on the Japanese web.

Beckii Cruel started to gain popularity at the end of this year thanks to some
videos posted on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/xBextahx ) where she
appears dancing in her room, to the tune of anime songs, attracting the
interest of inveterate fans of anime and manga.  
After becoming a celebrity on the Internet as user _xBextahx_ , she was
invited to perform in Akihabara, the district in eastern Tokyo that is widely
acknowledged as the symbol of the [otaku culture
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku)[en].

She is a pretty 14 year old girl living on the Isle of Man, England.  
After she read the manga _[Fruits
Basket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket )_ three years ago, she
went crazy for the Japanese otaku culture [she says].  
This March, Beckii Cruel published on Youtube videos of herself dancing to
Japanese anime songs.  
After the video _Danjo_ (Man and Woman) was shown on [the Japanese video
sharing website] Niko Niko Doga in May, her popularity exploded.

Beckii Cruel's popularity is certainly a Japanese phenomenon, as demonstrated
by the fact that the only [Wikipedia entry on her
](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AB
)is in Japanese. However, the word of mouth has spread also among those
foreigners who are passionate fans of Akihabara and the _otaku_ culture in
general.

_GodLen_ , at Animevice. com, for example,

akihabara/2829/) with a bit of mock jealousy on the British idol's career.
