It is a popular saying in Latin America that women always get what they want.
In Sarayaku, Ecuador, women from the Kichwa tribe proved the saying to be
true. When an oil company came onto their forest lands for oil exploration for
future drilling, the women decided to stop them with a simple but flawless
plan.

Esperanza Martinez says on the blog _Ecoportal [es]_ , that [women told their
husbands that if they allowed the companies to work on their lands, they would
have to find other women …on different
lands.](http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/84724) The Kichwas
organized a united front against the oil company until it finally had to
leave.

This group of Kichwas live in province of Pastaza, on 140 thousand hectares in
the Amazon, an area the Ecuadorian Ministry of Mines and Oil identified as
Block 23. Several companies attempted to work there throughout the years, but
they failed every time due to Kichwa’s opposition to drilling.

Although the decision to resist was made by the entire tribe, women’s
participation became a key component. These fearless women will go a long way
to preserve the forests and their lands.

**Support Women**

The blog _Observatorio Petrolero Sur [es]_ [publishes what Kichwa leader
Franklin Toala said about the role of women during this
process:](http://opsur.wordpress.com/2009/11/11/sarayaku-cuando-el-pueblo-
dice-no)

> Uno de los procesos que tuvo Sarayaku, que hay que recalcar, es el magnífico
> apoyo de las mujeres. La relación que existe entre las mujeres y las
> comunidades es mucho más fuerte.

One of the processes that Sarayacu went through that needs to be emphasized,
is the great support women provided. The relationship between women and the
communities is much stronger now.

Ecuadorian newspaper Diario Universal [described a chilling scene involving
Kichwa women that took place in
2003,](http://www.eluniverso.com/2003/02/05/0001/12/A2A1B5C330924D12B3D80265877DF953.html)when
15 women and children ran for 4 hours through the jungle yelling “anchuri,
(get out) anchuri oil companies,” to meet face to face with the oil company’s
workers and armed guards. Confrontations took place and eventually the army
intervened. But the Kichwas remained on their lands and kept them free of oil
drilling.

**Petroleum, Climate Change, and Indigenous women**

In Ecuador, several regions have already suffered the terrible environmental
and health consequences of oil drilling. [In Pichincha in the province of
Sucumbios, oil drilling has been taking place for 20
years](http://www.accionecologica.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1157&Itemid=1),
the air is polluted and the water contaminated because of oil spills. The
people have suffered the loss of domestic animals because of drinking
contaminated water and the loss of crops because the contaminated land becomes
infertile. They are also affected by several skin and respiratory diseases,
birth defects, and miscarriages.

Women are once again the most vulnerable to these negative impacts. In
petroleum areas of Ecuador the incidence of cancer is three times more
comparing to the national average, [especially affecting
women](http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/84724). Women are in
constant contact with contaminated water [by washing clothes and bathing their
children in the river](http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/84724).

It is no wonder Kichwa women reject oil drilling. They know it will transform
their lands, their lives, and the environment for ever.

**The Online Community Reacts to the Kichwa Example**

Blogger Efren Calapucha shares his feelings on the Kichwa’s stand on the blog
[_Redamazon [es]_](http://redamazon.wordpress.com/2008/08/17/kichwas-y-shuar-
en-contra-de-la-actividad-petrolera):

> ¡Amigos de la Tierra! En este espacio de la selva amazónica con grandes
> recursos biodiversos se quiere cercenar LA VIDA lo que NO PERMITEREMOS se
> establezca tan execrable hecho que afectará al Calentamiento Global
> extinguiéndose los pueblos, la flora y la fauna hasta hoy fortalecidas y
> guardadas celosamente

Friends of the Earth! In this place in the Amazon rainforest with significant
biodiversity resources, LIFE is threatened to be eliminated but we will NOT
ALLOW this terrible event to take place here, which will affect climate
change; extinguishing communities, fauna and flora, which have been
strengthened and safeguarded to this day.

The blog _Observatorio Petrolero Sur [es]_ posts about [the remarkable
determination of the Kichwas despite the
circumstances](http://opsur.wordpress.com/2009/11/11/sarayaku-cuando-el-
pueblo-dice-no):

> Han pasado dos décadas y hasta el momento la exploración no se concretó,
> pero la amenaza es permanente. En 20 años pasaron muchas cosas, demandas a
> nivel nacional e internacional, campañas en un lado y en el otro, y en el
> territorio la presión fue mucha. Los kichwas sufrieron todo tipo de
> atropellos, persecuciones e incluso la militarización de Sarayaku; pero
> siguieron diciendo no.

So far, oil exploration has not occurred, but the threat is constant. Many
things have happened over the past 20 years, including national and
international lawsuits, campaigns, and there was a lot of pressure. The
Kichwas suffered all kinds of abuses, persecutions, and even the
militarization of Sarayaku, but they kept saying ‘no.’

The Kichwa community has managed to keep their forests safe so far but the
struggle is not over. Of course with Kichwa women among them, they have little
to fear.

**Watch the Video**

A Kichwa child stands defiant with the words “I’m a forest protector” painted
on his chest. He appears in the

filmed and posted by Oilwatch, which is about the Sarayaku community’s
reaction to the attempt of an oil company to carry out oil exploration in
their lands. [Click here to watch the video in
