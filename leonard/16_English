The total number of Mobile Phone subscribers in Bangladesh is currently more
than [98 million](http://www.btrc.gov.bd/) and a large portion of them are
female. Targeting this population a maternal health care service using mobile
phone was launched recently.
[Aponjon](http://www.aponjon.com.bd/Content.php?MId=35&SubMId=53) is a mobile
phone based health service for expecting and new mothers in Bangladesh under
the auspices of [Mobile Alliance for Maternal
Action](http://healthunbound.org/mama/) (MAMA). It is a low-cost service, free
for the poorest 20 percent of its subscribers and it aims to reduce maternal
and newborn illnesses and deaths.

The Aponjon service was [introduced](http://degrees.fhi360.org/2012/12/from-
novel-idea-to-catalyst/) in September, 2011 in 13 locations of four districts
in Bangladesh with 1200 subscribers on a pilot basis. On completion of a
successful pilot, Aponjon kicked off its national scale operation. Aponjon
aspires to reach more than 2 million expecting women and new mothers by 2015.

**The state of of Mother and Infant health in Bangladesh**

Both the Maternal and child mortality rates are high in Bangladesh. [According
a report](http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/million-moms-bangladesh/),
every 45 minutes a woman in Bangladesh dies from complications in pregnancy or
childbirth. Every 4 minutes, a child less than 1 month old dies because their
mother didn't have access to proper post-natal and ante-natal care.

However, over the past decades, persistent efforts at national and local
level, have led to a sharp decline in maternal and child mortality in
Bangladesh. Infant mortality declined from 97 deaths per 1,000 live births in
1990 to 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011. In the same period, post-
neonatal mortality fell by 50 per cent, and under-5 mortality dropped by 67
per cent.

**Successes story**

[Asha Rani](http://aponjon.com.bd/Content.php?MId=37&SubMId=35), a 24-year old
woman happily married with two children, lives in the Vashantek slum in
Mirpur, one of the most crowded slums in Dhaka city. After the birth of her
second child she learned about “aponjon” from a health worker and got
registered. She is happy for the service:

In last few years, mobile phone rapidly spread in rural Bangladesh. Most of
Bangladesh are now covered under mobile network. So mobile phone is a very
convenient medium to send and receive information. [Dr. Fida
