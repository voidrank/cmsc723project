Mexican judge Blanca Lobo Dominguez ordered theaters to temporarily halt
screenings of the popular Mexican documentary _[Presunto
Culpable](http://www.presuntoculpable.org/) __[es] ([Presumed
Guilty](http://www.pbs.org/pov/presumedguilty/film_description.php))_. The
reason behind the ruling is that Victor Manuel Reyes Bravo, one of the
prosecution witnesses in the documentary, states he did not give the
filmmakers authorization to record him and appear in the film.

The documentary reveals a case where Mexico’s justice system appears weak and
deteriorated. This is shown through the story of Antonio Zuniga, who is
charged with murder in 2005. Throughout the movie the case is overturned, as
the information used for condemning him does not add up.

On the blog [_Gancho_ ](http://ganchoblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/popularity-of-
presumed-guilty-in-mexico.html)the popularity of the documentary is affirmed:

> I'd previously read far more about _Presumed Guilty_ , a documentary about
> what appears to be a truly heinous miscarriage of justice in the Mexican
> court system, in the [US
> media](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=12950322). However,
> [_Milenio_ says](http://www.milenio.com/node/653109) it has turned into that
> rarest of things: a documentary enjoying box-office success in Mexico. With
> the support of Cinépolis, the largest theater chain in the country, in its
> first weekend, _Presumed Guilty_ earned 6.4 million pesos. This is only
> $500,000 or so, but it's already halfway to being the most successful
> documentary in Mexican history.

Teacher and blogger Octavio Islas [expresses concern about how freedom of
expression ](http://octavioislas.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/6758-mexico-amedi-
rechazamos-la-censura-a-presunto-culpable/)[es] would be affected through the
screening halt of the documentary:

> La suspensión en las exhibiciones de la película _Presunto Culpable_ sería
> un atentado a la libertad de expresión. En esa cinta se muestran escenas de
> un proceso judicial que fue público. Los hechos allí registrados son de
> interés público –atendiendo al principio de máxima publicidad establecido en
> la Constitución– y su divulgación no requiere del permiso expreso de las
> personas que participaron en tales audiencias.

The exhibition suspension of the movie _Presumed Guilty_ would be a case of
violation of freedom of expression. In that film there are scenes of a public
trial. The facts recorded there are of public interest –taking into account
the principle of maximum disclosure provisions established in the
Constitution– and its disclosure does not require permission from the people
who participated in it.

Alejandro Ortiz Sotomajor [writes about the censorship
theories](http://vivirmexico.com/2011/03/se-suspende-la-proyeccion-del-
documental-presunto-culpable) [es] being discussed:

> Esta claro que no hay que pensar mucho para poder llegar a varias
> conclusiones, la principal y que anda en prácticamente boca de todos es que
> el sistema judicial no quiere que se saque a la luz todas la irregularidades
> en su administración y su forma de resolver los juicios.

It is clear that there is not much thinking required to reach several
conclusions, the main one and the one that is being talked about the most is
that the judicial system does not want the film to bring to light all the
irregularities in its administration and how they resolve trials.

The filmmakers, in an announcement posted on their
[website](http://www.presuntoculpable.org/) [es], state that the documentary
will continue to be shown until they receive a government or judicial order.
In the United States, the whole movie can be watched [online through the PBS
website](http://www.pbs.org/pov/presumedguilty/watch.php) until March 31,
2011.
