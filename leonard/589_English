Gay Pride Parade held on October 10, 2010, in Belgrade brought out the worst
and the best elements of Serbian society in the open. The police had to
suppress about 6,000 rioters who, in a very organized manner, wrecked damage
of at least EUR 1 million in the city center, while pro-democracy forces
hailed the event as a big advance for the freedoms of speech and association,
guaranteed by law.

As [reported](http://outboy.blog.mk/2010/10/11/prva-uspeshna-gej-parada-vo-
belgrad/) [MKD] by _Macedonia Gay Blog-Magazine_ , at least the legal part of
the event was a success:

During the day, the state media announcements kept repeating that over 60% of
the arrested rioters were not locals, but had been brought from other places
in Serbia in an organized manner. In various ways commentators complained of
the present levels of unchecked hate among the youth, and hinted or openly
blamed reactionary nationalist forces which relied on football hooligans to
form the core of paramilitary units during the Milošević regime. [In
total](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-
article.php?yyyy=2010&mm=10&dd=10&nav_id=70196) around 140 persons were
injured, mostly policemen, and the police detained over 200 suspects.

The social media [hero of the
day](http://www.mondo.rs/s185583/Info/Hronika_i_Drustvo/Policajac_postao_hit-
_Dosta_je_vise_rusenja.html) [SRP] was the policeman Saša Čordić, 26, who was
captured on video telling off a rioter [loose translation] “How dare you to
wreak havoc to _my Belgrade_! Get the fuck out of here!”

The video was instantly reproduced in several copies, with hundreds of
thousands views. [A Facebook page based on the
quote](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Moj-Beograd-si-dosao-da-
lomis/167898639891946) [SRP] very quickly gained several thousands of fans.

Another social media hit was the column “Open your mind!” by turbo-folk star
[Jelena Karleuša](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelena_Karleu%C5%A1a), first
propagated by Twitter users such as Slobodan Markovic, who
[described](http://twitter.com/smarkovic/status/27021481153) [SRP] it as
“brutal.”

In the [column](http://www.kurir-info.rs/kolumna/otvorite-svoj-um-54050.php)
[SRP], which won praise on FB by liberals who usually consider turbo-folk
reactionary, the singer asks when will “millions of Serbs stop allowing a
handful of human excrement to portray their people as savage and stupid.” She
candidly wrote about confronting the homophobic attitude of [her footballer
husband](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%C5%A1ko_To%C5%A1i%C4%87), a self-
proclaimed typical Serbian macho man, by exposing the hypocrisy and double
standards in regard to heterosexual and homosexual relations, as well as
refusing to continue to take part in sexual acts deemed “unnatural” by such
traditionalists, but required within their marriage.
