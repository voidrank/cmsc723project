Two former presidential candidates, two current Senators, and some
businesspeople have been calling for an impeachment of [President Fernando
Lugo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Lugo) for his inability to provide
security to the country. However, it has been the recent kidnapping of Fidel
Zavala, a cattle rancher who has been captive since October 15 and whose
kidnappers have demanded a 5 million dollar ransom, which has really stirred
up debate about who is ultimately responsible for the security concerns, what
steps should be taken to solve the situation, and whether the blame placed on
the President is merely a political maneuver by the opposition.

Zavala was kidnapped by the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP for its initials in
Spanish), a terrorist group believed to the continuation of the Patria Libre
political party. The EPP is also [said to have been advised by Colombia's FARC
in 2004 in the kidnapping and murder of Cecilia Cubas
[es]](http://noticias.aol.com/articulos/_a/afirman-que-ejercito-del-
pueblo/n20091016163309990032), daughter of former President Raúl Cubas.

Liberal senator [Alfredo Jaeggli said Lugo should face an impeachment
[es]](http://www.abc.com.py/abc/nota/36712-Senador-Jaeggli-pide-juicio-
pol%C3%ADtico-para-Lugo/) because he is not fulfilling his functions as
president by not providing security to Paraguayan citizens. The impeachment
idea is also supported by Pedro Fadul and Lino Oviedo, both former
presidential candidates and Senator Julio Cesar Velázquez.

What places Lugo in an even more difficult position is that the President has
been linked to members involved in Cubas’ case, to the point that Cecilia’s
mother, Mirta Guzinsky,[ launched a video during the 2008 presidential
campaigns asking citizens not to vote for Lugo
[es]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-iSZsd-Bl8&feature=related). The video
has now been revived within the online Paraguayan community through collective
emails with the subject line: “What if Mirtha Gusinsky was right?” Lugo was
the Bishop of San Pedro department in 2004 when he said he had not heard
anything about the kidnap, even though the Cubas case was on every single
media utlet in the country at that point.

Debates are ongoing both within the high political spheres and among regular
Paraguayan citizens. Blogger José Angel López Barrios, comments on his blog
[that the government is not now nor has never been equipped to fight the
increasing kidnap industry

There is no doubt that there are many factors that make the kidnaps possible,
which have been haunting us, we have had about 100 kidnaps in the last 8 years
and the main outstanding factor is that the people who are supposed to be
responsible of solving these crimes are not prepared for the task (…)

The unbelievable sum of money requested by the kidnappers (5 million dollars)
reveals that behind their request lies the idea of financing more operations
for this clandestine group.

Maki Fretez, a blogger who comments on an ABC Color article, [says impeachment
is fundamental to reestablish security and safety in Paraguay

Changing the president at this moment is a matter of survival! Otherwise we
better turn off the lights and leave the country as soon as possible. A
political trial is a constitutional mechanism, so it can’t be considered an
irregular measure to take.

Others believe the impeachment flag is being used by politicians to favor
their parties and personal interests, and that it is neither helping the
kidnapped Zavala’s circumstances, nor improving the situation in the country.

The political trial idea was incited by the opposition and the press – who
insinuated that Lugo’s silence meant he was hiding something- and of course,
by the vice president who insisted in his auto destructive and irritating
function of pointing out his differences with the president.

At times when it is necessary to use trouble-free words and reflect prudently,
the irresponsible disqualification and fanatic clamor prevailed. The person
who should have been the main concern – probably captive in dramatic
conditions in the forest in the North – became a secondary issue.

As Zavala remains captive, the debate over security concerns continues.
