The investigation of a political corruption case known as ““Gürtel” has
revealed more serious facts like the alleged [under the table salaries given
to some members of the Popular Party (PP)
leadership](http://www.publico.es/449937/el-hombre-que-destapo-las-
irregularidades-en-el-pp-rajoy-no-tiene-verguenza-ni-perdon-de-dios) [es],
which currently rules Spain [“under the table” means an illegal salary that is
not officially informed or regulated]. The former treasurer of the PP, Luis
Bárcenas, who up until a couple of weeks ago still had an office at the
party's headquarters and was backed up by the leaders, is now being
[investigated for having a Swiss account with 22 million euros and for paying
bonus salaries under the
table](http://politica.elpais.com/tag/caso_barcenas/a/) [es] during long
periods of time to important public offices.

It could turn out to be the most important corruption case in all Spanish
history, and in spite of that, the implicated have denied all accusations,
bragged about having transparent accounts, and are still asking the people to
“adjust their budgets” due to the current crisis. To regain the citizens’
trust and prove their innocence, members of the party have offered solutions
like [an internal audit and sworn income
declarations](http://www.publico.es/449938/cospedal-asegura-que-los-
dirigentes-del-pp-haran-declaraciones-juradas-de-renta-para-mostrar-su-
inocencia) [es] which have angered everyone even more.

The case has caused strong reactions that have led to protests on the streets
and on the web. Even though Twitter was down because of an overload several
times during the day, netizens managed to [call a sit-in infront of the
Popular Party ](http://www.publico.es/449917/a-las-20-horas-en-genova-
pasalo)[es] in Madrid. As it had already happened before, the police
surrounded Génova street, where the party headquarters are located, but the
massive amount of citizens that protested chanting “Quit Government”, “There
it is, Ali Baba's cave” and “The president is a criminal.”

Since the newspaper El País [leaked secret
documents](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/01/31/album/1359589649_452820.html#1359589649_452820_1359589849)
[es] that proved the illegal financing of the PP, social media have become the
support system for the popular outcry. An online petition at Change.org, which
is still running, managed to [receive 100,000 signatures in 10
hours](https://www.change.org/es/peticiones/un-mill%C3%B3n-de-firmas-por-la-
dimisi%C3%B3n-de-la-c%C3%BApula-del-pp-lospapelesdeb%C3%A1rcenas-
quesevayantodos) [es] asking for the resignation of the Spanish government.
Also, an initiative called the Spanish people to publish thousands of comments
with envelope drawings (the money was supposedly handed out in envelopes) on
[the party's Facebook wall](https://www.facebook.com/pp?ref=ts&fref=ts) [es].
The party's communication department was not able to erase them all.

The hashtag **#lospapelesdebárcenas** (Barcena's papers) [turned into a
worldwide trending
topic](http://www.deia.com/2013/01/31/politica/estado/barcenas-y-sus-papeles-
trending-topic-mundial-en-twitter) [es], as informed by several media. Also,
other related hashtags about the case appeared on Twitter. For example,
#pelisconbárcenas (movies with Bárcenas) opened the room for netizens to use
their imagination and humor to comment the news using movies names in an
attempt to highlight that reality exceeds fiction. Hashtag #DondeestaRajoy
(where is Rajoy?) emerged as a way to denounce Mariano Rajoy's (Spain's
President) silence because he hasn't made a statement on the case or on his
possible involvement.

[The international press has echoed the severity of the situation
](http://www.publico.es/449934/la-marca-espana-que-exporta-el-pp)[es] that
Spain is going through, and

several netizens have pointed out that the government, and not the protesters,
are the ones harming Spain's image overseas, in reference to an accusation
made by the government.

Spanish bloggers also had a say on the scandal. Principia Marsupia published
an article with the title [“4 modest proposals for a revolution in
Spain”](http://www.principiamarsupia.com/2013/02/01/4-modestas-propuestas-
para-una-revolucion-en-espana/) [es]. The post makes a call to the party
members and employees, to the citizens with a bank account, and to
administration and strategic industry bureaucrats to denounce irregularities
and take on the streets to end the financial scandals that hurt the country so
much. It seems that this protest is already taking place since some mayors and
party members have already presented their [resignation and have defected the
government](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/02/01/actualidad/1359723443_216003.html)
[es]. The blogger introduced the case as follows:

> Algunos seréis de derechas y otros somos de izquierdas. Ojalá eso no cambie
> nunca: la tensión de ideas y el debate riguroso son los requisitos
> fundamentales para que una sociedad avance. Pero creo que muchos estaréis de
