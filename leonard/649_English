A new Facebook app has been creating some controversy in India. The [Facebook
app](http://www.facebook.com/VaselineMenBePrepared), launched by
[Vaseline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaseline), is a product line owned by
Unilever lets [users lighten the skin colour on their profile
pictures](http://www.facebook.com/VaselineMenBePrepared?v=wall#!/VaselineMenBePrepared?v=info).
It is not the first time that desirability of ‘fairness’ has been discussed in
the Indian blogosphere. However, the app in question promotes a product that
targets men, which is a relatively new trend. So far, most fairness creams in
the Indian market usually target female consumers. _[Le

observes:

> The thing that strikes me most about this advertisement is that, it in fact
> focuses on the need for men to have fair skin, not women. That boggles my
> mind considering that in Anthropological speak; women are the ones who
> represent culture not men. In one way, these advertisements are certainly
> progressive in their inclusion of men in the “fairness” conversation.

In response to [Le Sigh](http://sailajajoshi.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/fair-
for-facebook/#comment-73)‘s post, a comment by _Sneha_ , who works for an
advertising agency, [highlights some of the reasons for men becoming the
target of fairness cream
manufacturers](http://sailajajoshi.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/fair-for-
facebook/#comment-73).

> Also, as more relationships develop outside the arranged marriage system and

_Suhail_ at _[Rantings of a Homesick
Lunatic](http://homesicklunatic.blogspot.com/2010/07/fair-game.html)_
discusses the subliminal racism that exists in India, where preference to
lighter skin is deeply entrenched in many communities. This preference can
manifest in many ways.

> Some pretty obvious observations are the film industry, and down south
> females need to have milky-white skin to be able to land the big roles along
> side “superstars”, who are sometimes on the other end of the skin color
> spectrum, but that's more sexist than racist. It became pretty apparent to
> me that camera-facing jobs for TV and media almost always go for the fairer
> skinned candidate.

_[Freshbrew](http://www.afreshbrew.com/2010/07/whats-the-brouhaha-on-fairness-
creams-for-men-is-it-just-a-gender-bias/)_ points out that the controversial
aspect of the product's marketing strategy is not so much that it attempts to
sell ‘fairness’ but that it sells it to men, and that it's for this reason
that people are sitting up and taking note.
_[Bhatnaturally](http://www.lbhat.com/online/vaseline-and-the-pitfalls-of-a-
borderless-digital-world/)_ points out that it maybe pointless to blame the
manufacturers of the product, and perhaps that the ‘digital’ nature of the
campaign brings more focus to the product and the app.

> People accuse brands like these of reinforcing the notion that fairness is
> more desirable, superior and causing great harm to society. The counter
> argument that such brands merely tap into an existing need (long before such
> products were even conceived or advertised) falls on deaf ears.

A related sentiment is echoed in[ many comments across
blogs](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/07/20/skin-whitening-
tanning-and-vaselines-controversial-facebook-ad-campaign.html/comment-
page-1#comment-204181), where people feel that the preference for being light
skinned is being judged by those who are not familiar with the cultural
context and is being labeled racist. _Gautam Ramdurai_ comments in [Danah
