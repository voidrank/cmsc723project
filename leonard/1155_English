A 2008 version of the stamp, before the price increase

As Muslims in the United States celebrate [Eid al-
Fitr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr), the celebration which marks
the end of Ramadan, a pernicious chain e-mail is making its rounds. The e-mail
falsely claims that President Obama has issued a new postage stamp
commemorating the two Eid celebrations and urges readers to boycott it, naming
several terrorist attacks on the U.S. over the past twenty years. The full
text of the e-mail can be seen in [this
post](http://missivesfrommarx.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/this-stuff-makes-me-
sick/#comment-1096) by _Missives from Marx_ , who expresses frustration at the
letter, saying:

> I received the following email forward today from a family member. It is
> because of stuff like this that I’m going to have to spend four weeks of my
> Western Religions course deconstructing Muslim stereotypes. This is why
> critical thinking has to be an essential component of all my courses.

As it turns out, there's nothing new about the letter, or the stamp.

explains that the letter has been around since at least 2002, while the stamp
itself was issued on September 1, 2001.

Aziz Poonwalla, on the BeliefNet blog _City of Brass_ ,
[explains](http://blog.beliefnet.com/cityofbrass/2009/09/terror-mail-the-eid-
stamp.html) the history of the e-mail:

> Versions of the email, which has been making the rounds for years, have been
> [repeatedly debunked](http://www.snopes.com/politics/stamps/eidstamp.asp)
> before, but it still persists. I've blogged extensively about [the history
> of the Eid stamp](http://cityofbrass.blogspot.com/2007/10/eid-stamp.html),
> the controversy that accompanied it when it was introduced (mostly from
> conservative Republicans), and the defense of the stamp by President Bush
> and Speaker Hastert. In a nutshell, the stamp was introduced on September
> 1st 2001, ten days before the 9-11 attacks, during the Bush Administration.
> Mayor Piper joins a long list of conservative politicians who have no

A [post](http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2009/09/04/the-mayors-anti-islamic-
email-is-a-major-embarrassment/) on the _Clarksville Online_ , a blog for the
town of Clarksville, Tennessee, explains why the e-mail has made major
headlines this year:

> Clarksville Tennessee’s Mayor, Johnny Piper has sent an inflammatory anti-
> Islamic email to employees of the city, encouraging them to boycott a stamp
> issued by the U.S. Postal Service…
>
> …Mayor Piper has since attempted to defend his actions, but they are simply
> indefensible. Muslims are a integral part of this country. They serve
> honorably in our armed forces, defending our nation, and our freedoms. No
> one should be treated like a second class citizens based on their religious
> beliefs, or the actions of a radical fringe. This incident created by our
> Mayor has been an embarrassment for our City, our State, and our Country.

Sheila Musaji has been tracking chain e-mails about the stamp for _The
American Muslim (TAM)_ since 2005, and in an update, [remarks
