There is another side to the ongoing revolution in Egypt, which is the daily
life of those people sitting in on [Tahrir
Square](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tahrir_Square). For the
past 12 days, they have remained on the square, eating, drinking, chanting,
cheering – simply living there day and night. Life here has its own rhythm
now, and the spirit on diplay is of a mini Utopia.

Mornings begin with physical exercises while chanting “Down down Mubarak!”.

As the day continues, and more people pour into the square, residents welcome
them with more chants as
[@ashoukry](http://twitter.com/ashoukry/status/34051377680359424) says:

أجمل لحظات اليوم:استقبال الثوار بالغناء و التصفيق عند دخول التحرير، لحظات لا
تنسي و نسائم حرية حقيقية تتهادي و تتدفق فاذهبوا و أروا قلوبكم

The best time of the day: Welcoming the rebels into Tahrir Sq. with singing
and clapping. Unforgettable moments where we breathe the air of freedom.

The million pound question on everyone's mind, was asked by
[@Maysaloon](http://twitter.com/Maysaloon/status/33973641213382656) from Syria
on Twitter:

> Had a thought today, what are all those people in Tahrir Square doing for
> sanitation? I don't see any cubicles anywhere…

And so [I replied](http://twitter.com/Lastoadri/status/33975887120572417):

> Either they use nearby mosques’ or underground public toilets, or nearby
> buildings, or shops. Some even return home & come back.

For instance [@TAFATEFO](http://twitter.com/TAFATEFO/status/33974330459160576)
tweeted while staying on Tahrir Square himself:

واحد قال في الميك انه ممثل أصحاب الـ 3 عمارات اللي في الميدان .. وانهم فاتحين
الدورين السادس والسابع للي عايزين ياخدوا دش أو يناموا

Someone said on the loudspeakers that he is a representative from the 3
buildings on the square. They said they opened their 6th and 7th floors to
anyone wants to take a shower or sleep.

With every that day passes, the mood on the square becomes more like a daily
open carnival organised by the people and for the people. As
[@etharkamal](http://twitter.com/etharkamal/status/34232446962638850) tweeted:

At night, its much quieter, yet the same spirit prevails.

One night people combined their chants in a song entitled “Power to the
people” to celebrate Egyptian youth coming together for peace, freedom and
change:
