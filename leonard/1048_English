On the same day as the Presidential elections in Uruguay, two ballot questions
were presented to voters. One of the questions asked whether the [hundreds of
thousands of Uruguayans living
abroad](http://www.uruguaydailynews.com/news.php?viewStory=2736) should have
the right to the epistolary or consular vote. The debate was based on whether
or not those that live outside of the country should have the right to elect
who will govern those still living in Uruguay.

At the website [_Voto x Uruguay [es]_](http://votoxuruguay.org) (I Vote for
Uruguay), there are many videos with messages of support for this motion by
Uruguayans living abroad. who want the right to vote. There were videos
submitted from Canada, Spain, France, and the United States. This video
created in the Spanish city of Ferrol shows a group of Uruguayan ex-pats, who
gathered to simulate a vote, as a way to show their support for their right to
vote.

However, the result on election day was “No,” with only 36.93% voting “Yes.”

The other plebiscite that attracted more attention and caused more sad and
surprise reactions, was the question that attempted to annul the [Law of
Expiration
[es].](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_de_Caducidad_de_la_Pretensi%C3%B3n_Punitiva_del_Estado)
This current Uruguayan law establishes that the crimes committed by the
military and the police during the last civic-military dictatorship, which
included multiple violations of human rights, would remain with amnesty.

The United Nations has observed the law, and it has also been [repudiated by
the Organization of American States
[es]](http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=165484&sts=1). However,
in the end the vote results to annul the law reached 47.36%, and it did not
reach the necessary 50% + 1.

This result caused strong and sad reactions from the various online
communities. In Facebook, for example, in the two days following the vote,
there were a large number of groups created, such as [Parliament Should Annul
the Law of Expiration
[es]](http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=161794828955), [I Cannot
Believe that the Law was not Annulled
[es]](http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=163486372374), [National
Mourning [es]](http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=158946383234), and[ I
Will Never Forget
[es]](http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=158220813001).

For some, like 19-year-old Mauricio P. Milano of the blog _Montevideo Blogger
[es]_ [writes why he neither voted “no,” nor “yes” in the
question](http://mvd-blogger.blogspot.com/2009/10/nadie-me-conoce-segunda-
parte.html):

Even though fortunately, I was not alive during the dictatorship era in
Uruguay, with the few years that I have already lived, I have already heard
hundreds of stories about this history, in favor of the military and in favor
of the (guerrilla group) Tupamaros. Maybe the eclecticism that characterizes
me as typical of a generation that came after the waters subsided, like mine,
but the opinion that I have been formulating from all this is that both groups
were wrong, there were crimes (kidnappings, murders) from both sides and in
reality, neither can wash their hands of what they have done. This is
historically undeniable. I will not comment on the hypocrisy of the simple
fact that one of the Presidential candidates belonged to the Tupamaros,
because I have already commented on it on [this post [es]](http://mvd-
blogger.blogspot.com/2009/08/nadie-me-conoce-primera-parte.html).

What I want to say today, in favor of justice and the right to choose by those
who were involved in that history, is that I consider it to be unacceptable
that my generation must bear the weight of the decision to annul or not the
Law of Expiration. For the simple fact that we did not live it and we will
never understand the true profundity of the concepts that it involves, because
we had nothing to do with it. In fewer words, we do not need to assume the
mistakes made by those that came before us. To say this does not mean to look
the other way. In any case, it is to look ahead. Society, like each of the
person who is a part of it, has wounds. Since they are wounds, it is obvious
that they burn. Since they are wounds, the more that they are stirred, the
longer it takes to close. I will not let what happened before, contaminate my
generation, I do not want that social disease.

Finally, in _Asi Ta'l Mundo, Botija [es]_ , there are thoughts on why the law
was not annulled. [He writes that these plebiscites should not be conducted on
the same day as elections because too many are overwhelmed and that the
information does not arrive as it
should](http://www.asitalmundobotija.com.uy/2009/10/26/uruguay-un-pais-
politicamente-raro).
