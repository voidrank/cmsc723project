Egyptians are [dreaming](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/06/egypt-
dreaming-of-a-better-tomorrow/) of a better future, and for some the dream is
already coming true. In this post we hear from Egyptian bloggers who feel they
are seeing a new country being born, the country they have been waiting for.

_Mona Seif_ ([@monasosh](http://twitter.com/monasosh)) has been giving regular
updates from Tahrir Square, including on the night of [2
February](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_protests#2.C2.A0February).
She reacts to the descriptions of her being
[“brave”](http://ma3t.blogspot.com/2011/02/i-was-not-brave-i-was-
protected.html):

> I have to clarify this: I was not brave, I was protected.  
>  The battle extended over the night. It started with rocks & glass, moved
> onto Molotov cocktails, then there was gun fire. The army was there
> motionless, and at one point they even all went down and hid in their
> trucks.  
>  I could never find the words to describe the bravery I witnessed that
> night. […] That night made me fully realize, the Egypt I really want is that
> of Tahrir square. The people there are what Egypt is all about, and I am
> with them in whatever fate awaits us.

_Merry_ describes visiting Tahrir Square with a friend, and the encounter they
had with some [protestors](http://obliviology.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/square-
of-angels/):

> One of them asked me and my friend as his face beamed with a smile “why did
> you come?”… my friend said “because this is our country…”, I looked him in
> the eye and resisted hugging him as I answered “because YOU are my country”…
> and they are, Oh God, they are the country I have been looking for my entire
> life and I finally found it…

The sentiment is echoed by _Nadia El-Awady_ on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/NadiaE/status/34191736418869248):

> Egyptians at home: stop watching state tv and come to tahrir. See the #Egypt
> we've all been longing for #jan25

The blogger who calls herself _Fugitive in a World of Dreams_
[writes](http://donia-gheer-eldonia.blogspot.com/2011/02/blog-post.html):

كنت قد اخترت لمدونتي اسم دنيا غير الدنيا علي اعتبار انها دنيا احلام .. لم ولن
يتحقق فيها فيها شيء مما نرجو…. دنيا اسبح فيها بخيالي لابعد ما يكون دون الوصول
لادني حلم …. لكن بعد الخامس والعشرين من يناير اكتشفت ان انني كنت مخطئة لابعد
حد ….فقد علمني شباب مصر بل علم العالم باسره انه لا مستحيل يمكنك ان تحلم وتصل
بحلمك لابعد ما يكون يكفيك الارادة وحدها كي تحقق ما تتمناه … انني فخورة باني
مصرية وبأني انتمي لهدا الجيل الرائع من شباب مصر …. لقد اصبحت مصر فعلا دنيا غير
الدنيا بكل المقاييس

I chose for my blog the name “A World Out Of This World”, referring to it
being a world of dreams…Nothing we were hoping for had been or would be
achieved in it… A world in which I could swim around in my imagination,
however far it might be, without reaching the nearest dream… But after 25
January I discovered that I had been greatly mistaken… Egyptian youth taught
me – indeed the whole world taught me – that it is not impossible; you can
dream and achieve your dream, however large it is. All you need is the will to
achieve what you are hoping for… I am proud that I am Egyptian and that I
belong to this wonderful generation of Egyptian youth… Egypt has truly become
a world out of this world, by every measure.
