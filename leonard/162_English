The death of Osama Bin Laden in
[Abbottabad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbottabad), Pakistan, has benefited
not only the United States and its President Barack Obama, but also some of
the city's local business owners.

_Coffity_ , a local coffee house, turned into the second hottest place in town
overnight, the first one being the house where Bin Laden had been killed. As
“the first coffee shop in Abbottabad […] serving espresso based coffees
prepared from freshly ground beans” and offering “a smoke-free environment and
free wifi,” Coffity has been transformed into a unique local press center,
where international journalists gather exclusive information on the recent
events from locals.

After Osama Bin Laden

Coffity's online presence has been growing as well. Early in the morning on
May 2, 2011, Coffity's Facebook page was among the first outlets [to inform
the world](http://www.facebook.com/Coffity.Abbottabad/posts/168348096557290)
about the crash of a U.S. helicopter involved in the Bin Laden hunt:

> Hope everyone is safe and unaffected by the helicopter crash/blast

The [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/Coffity.Abbottabad) and Coffity's
Twitter account ([@coffity](https://twitter.com/#!/coffity/)) show how
business is now being done in a new way.

Norwegian journalist Mariane Vikas used Coffity to seek local sources for
information regarding Osama's death. She
[asked](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=168419756550124&id=751830653):

> Anyone in Abbottabad who has seen/know something about the operation against
> Osama bin Laden? Norwegian journalist seeking info. Pls message me.

Spanish journalist Julio Cesar Escovar added his request to the same thread:

> And journalist from Spain too, any help?

A Pakistani user [Umar
Naveed](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=168419756550124&id=751830653)
offered to help:

> contact me i tell you

[Jessi Spaulding
Johnson](http://www.facebook.com/j.johnson1979/posts/168640873194679) offered
a piece of advice to Coffity:

> Better up your prices. Journalists love their coffee. ;)

[Initially](https://twitter.com/#!/coffity/status/64901019737407488),
Coffity's owner didn't seem too prepared for the influx of large numbers of
journalists:

> Oops! Here's to hoping journalists don't drink a lot of coffee…

And today Coffity was [obviously
overworked](http://www.facebook.com/Coffity.Abbottabad/posts/168700189855414):

> The Coffity UPS is being used by media people; We can not turn the generator
> on today as there are a lot of voice conversations going on – so we will be
> closed for a while – until further notice. Non-coffee + non-blended items
> still available.

Michelle Klein-Hass [left this
note](http://www.facebook.com/msgeek/posts/169035133155253) to Coffity's
owner:

> instead as “That guy who writes awesome code and makes the best coffee
> drinks in the greater Islamabad area.” Cheers from an American geek.
