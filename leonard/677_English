In a space of a month, Singapore authorities caused a major uproar when they
banned a film of an ex-political prisoner and arrested a British author who
wrote a book about the death penalty in Singapore.

On 12 July 2010, the Media Development Authority announced its decision to ban
a film (starting from 14 July 2010) depicting Dr Lim Hock Siew speaking
publicly on his experience being detained under the Internal Security Act. The
film was filmed by Director [Martyn See](http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/).
Mr See was also asked to remove the film from YouTube. You can read the
transcripts of the film [here](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/07/film-
banned-so-herere-the-transcripts/).

Singaporean blogger, Lucky Tan
[called](http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2010/07/this-video-is-now-
banned.html) for the truth to be told:

> Basically what MICA is saying is they banned this film because they want
> only the truth to be told and this film is full of falsehoods, lies and
> distortions. Dr Lim Hock Siew was detained for 20 years without trial.
> During that period, the PAP govt had all the time to show the evidence and
> tell the truth so that we can all see how wonderful a job the ISD has done
> to protect us from evil. We are all still waiting.

On 18th July, British author Alan Shadrake was arrested by Singapore police in
his hotel on charges of ‘criminal defamation’, a day after his book, Once a
Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which was critical of the
Singapore judicial system was launched. His book was also taken off major
bookstores in Singapore.

He was detained for two days in which Amnesty International and Reporters
Without Borders called for his release.

Singapore socio-political blog, [The Online
Citizen](http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/07/alan-shadrake%E2%80%99s-crime/)
wondered why Mr Shadrake was charged with criminal defamation:

> Alan Shadrake’s book “Once a Jolly Hangman” makes for uncomfortable reading.
> The book might have made those in power uncomfortable enough to arrest Mr
> Shadrake on the rarely used draconian charge of criminal defamation.

A Singaporean blog, Chemical Generation Singapore,
[wrote](http://chemgen.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/shadrake-jolly-no-more-for-
now/):

> With the arrest of Shadrake, the whole issue is less about the death
> penalty, and more about where we draw the line on supposed foreign

> logistics is fine with me. But turning the screws on a foreigner in his book
> launch, although the foreigner is like a taunting Oliver Fricker and asking
> for it, is a bit too much in my book. Unless there is more than meets the

Political Activist, Chee Siok Chin [accused
](http://cheesiokchin.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/exposing-the-truth-scares-the-
pap/) the Government of having ‘dirty secrets':

> Now, which authoritarian regime would want to have it’s “dirty little
> secrets” blown opened in a book?
>
> The same goes for Dr. Lim Hock Siew’s speech that was put up by Martyn See

> without trial by the ISD.

> Again, which oppressive regime would want to have the truth told about how
