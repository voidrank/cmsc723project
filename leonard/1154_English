Cyberspace is more and more inhabited by government institutions in many
countries. Whether it is for the sake of elections, as during President
Obama's campaign in 2008, or for the sake of fighting for fair elections as
[recently happened in
Iran](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/iranian-election-2009/)
when Twitter was used by the Mousavi campaign, during the election and also in
the subsequent demonstrations.

Despite the fact that the 2010 presidential race is already warming up on the
Brazilian Internet, as future candidates start to blog and twitter to promote
themselves online, the government has just taken the first step in becoming
digital. On 31 June the Ministry of Culture and the National Network of
Education and Research officially launched the Forum for Brazilian Digital
Culture. The project consists of a social network that aims to encourage
Brazilian netizens to collaborate in creating a new mode of addressing public
policies.

This initiative has gone down well with Bloggers and twitter users who think
that the government has finally made an effort to reach out to people and
include them in public policies through the Internet, a direct and bureaucracy
free communication tool for contacting citizens. The network was initially
limited to only 300 people, but after its launch, it has been opened to anyone
interested in #culturadigitalbr, as it has been referred to on Twitter.

[_Lady Bug Brasil_](http://www.ladybugbrazil.com/) [pt] was invited to the
launch of the event. She [commented on her
blog](http://www.ladybugbrazil.com/2009/07/29/forum-de-cultura-digital-
brasileira/) [pt]:

> Em tempos de luta, censura e políticas públicas que precisam de retoques, é
> um alívio saber que há esperança e iniciativas democráticas que abrem espaço
> para as muitas vozes que habitam a rede.

In times of fighting back against censorship and public policies that need to
be amended, it is a relief to know that there is still hope and democratic
initiatives that give some space to the various voices that inhabit the
Internet.

_Gilberto Jr_ from the _[startupi](http://startupi.com.br/en/) _blog was also
invited to the launch. He [blogged in
English](http://startupi.com.br/en/2009/culturadigitalbr-government-launches-
social-network-for-public-policy-suggestions/):

> The simple fact that the federal government initiated this project is highly
> commendable. It opens discussion within communities, using the web as a base
> to stimulate discussion and create a kind of digital democracy (not just in
> the world of computing, but in Brazil in general).

The project features some other social network characteristics such as a
Facebook-like wall-to-wall comment system and the chance to aggregate online
discussions taking place on forums or Orkut. Everyday, new users join the
network and many discussion topics have been created. Another interesting
point to the launch was that many bloggers were invited to the press
conference alongside the mainstream media.

_Filipe Saraiva_ from the _[Liberdade na
Fronteira](http://liberdadenafronteira.blogspot.com/)_ blog [Freedom at the
Frontier, pt] gives his thoughts on this case. He praises the government
[saying](http://liberdadenafronteira.blogspot.com/2009/07/forum-da-cultura-
digital-brasileira.html) [pt]:

> Penso ser uma iniciativa bastante louvável por parte do governo. Em tempos
> de repressão ao compartilhamento na rede, vistos nos recentes casos do
> julgamento do The Pirate Bay ou no Projeto de Lei Azeredo, fomentar um
> espaço de discussão pública sobre um tema ainda bastante controverso mostra
> disposição e abertura para novas práticas e idéias que surgem no
> ciberespaço.

I think this is a praiseworthy initiative from the government. In times of
restrictions on network filesharing, as in the recent cases of the Pirate Bay
trial or the [Azeredo Bill](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2006/11/11/holding-
the-line-for-internet-freedoms-in-brazilian-cyberspace/), to promote a space
for public discussion on a still controversial subject is a display of
enthusiasm for and openness towards the new practices and ideas arising in
cyberspace.

Twitter user [@raquelcamargo](http://twitter.com/raquelcamargo) highlights a
possible problem on the Forum,
[tweeting](http://twitter.com/raquelcamargo/statuses/3113094277) [pt]:

> As discussões no Fórum da Cultura Digital acabam rápido, sempre com poucas
> mensagens.

The discussions on the Forum for Brazilian Digital Culture finish very
quickly, always with only a few messages.

CulturaDigitalBr has five main subjects up for discussion at the moment. They
want to build guidelines for the access, production, promotion, preservation
and free circulation of culture on any of these themes and topics are divided
[as follows](http://www.culturadigital.br/o-forum/eixos/) [pt]:

> 1\. Memória Digital (acervo, história e futuro);
>
> 2\. Economia da Cultura Digital (compartilhamento, interesse público e
> mercado);
>
> 3\. Infra-estrutura para a Cultura Digital (infovia, acesso e inclusão);
>
> 4\. Arte Digital (linguagem, democratização e remix);
>
> 5\. Comunicação Digital (língua, mídia e convergência).

1\. Digital Memory (collection, history and future);
