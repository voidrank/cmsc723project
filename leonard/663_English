Last May the [National Bank of
Angola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Angola) (BNA) brought
into circulation coins in denominations of 5 kwanzas, to join the 1, 2, 10 and
50 [kwanza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angolan_kwanza) coins, which are
circulating again.

The author of the blog _[After all I’m just a boy walking
around](http://justaboywalkingaround.blogspot.com)_ [pt] explains the purpose
of reintroducing of the coins:

> Com este objectivo pretende-se defender o consumidor, contribuindo para
> maior rigor nos trocos e menores perdas por parte deste. Ainda hoje ao
> almoço, a conta acabava em 7,50 kwanzas o que não me fez receber os 2,50
> kwanzas a que tinha direito (mesmo sendo um valor residual, somado muitas
> vezes, dá um valor grande). Num país com extrema pobreza parece-me uma
> medida adequada a proteger os mais pobres.

With this objective they intend to protect consumers, helping to make change
more precise, and to reduce losses to consumers when receiving change. Just
this lunchtime, my bill ended with 7.50 kwanzas, which left me without the
2.50 kwanzas that were owed to me (while this may be a residual amount, when
it happens many times it can add up). In a country with extreme poverty it
seems to me a good way to protect the poorest people.

The use of the coins has caused some suspicion among the population. According
to the newspaper _[Jornal de
Angola](http://jornaldeangola.sapo.ao/15/0/moedas_voltam_a_circular)_ [Angola
Newspaper, pt], “for many, they are a hurdle, because shopkeepers refuse to
accept them”. However there are those who defend the circulation of the coins,
arguing that they should be circulating in the formal and informal market, due
to the “poor conservation of small bills” which are currently in circulation.

Afonso Loureiro of the blog _Aerograma_
[writes](http://afonsoloureiro.net/blog/?p=4370) [pt] on this matter:

> Faz sentido que se cunhem moedas para substituir as notas de denominações
> mais baixas, que se estragam muito depressa. Por trocar de mãos muitas vezes
> por dia, a vida média de uma nota de 50 kwanzas deve ser de apenas alguns
> meses, por exemplo.

It makes sense to issue new coins to replace the low-denomination bills, which
wear out very quickly. Because they change hands many times each day, the
average life-span of a 50 kwanza bill must be only a few months, for example.

The question of coins in Angola has inspired artists, such as Manuel Guedes
dos Santos Lima, who in his poem “Kwanza” makes a poetic joke about the Kwanza
(the biggest river in Angola), and the national currency of the same name. The
author of [MultiBlog](http://bronzeletras.blogspot.com/2010/06/manuel-guedes-
dos-santos-lima.html) published his poem and says that “Angola’s real currency
is the dollar”.

In fact, with the coins in circulation, the Angolan government is trying to
curtail the use of the currency which really has reign over the country, the
dollar. The American currency has found its way into the national market
thanks to the political and military instability from which Angola has
suffered; the country was for almost 30 years absorbed in war, a struggle
between the two major national political parties, Unita and MPLA.

According to the newspaper _O País_ [The Country, pt], [price-setting policy
is still under evaluation](http://www.opais.co.mz/) due to the coexistence of
the two currencies in Angolan daily life, a practice which has its roots in
the habits of the general population, and although advised against by the
National Institute of Consumer Protection (INADEC, Instituto Nacional de
Defesa do Consumidor), it is naturally difficult to change.
