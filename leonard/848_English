On Friday of last week, [Ivo
Josipović](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Josipović) took office as
Croatia's third president, replacing outgoing two-term president, [Stjepan
Mesić](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stjepan_Mesić). The BBC
[ran](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8521615.stm) an extensive article
covering what the new president symbolizes as well as the hurdles that Croatia
faces in getting ever-closer to EU membership in 2011 or 2012. But, let's look
at what bloggers are having to say about this large change of power that has
coincided with Prime Minister, [Ivo
Sanader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Sanader), suddenly stepping down
last year and completely withdrawing from politics.

> I very much liked today's inauguration of the new president. The whole

Naturally, there are detractors, such as some of [these
comments](http://www.blog.hr/komentari/news/6002/novi-predsjednik-je-ivo-
josipovic.html) (HRV), especially one by _Vidi pisme ove_ (see this song):

> All this is just a performance, nothing more…  
>  we are all long since bought and sold…  
>  politicians are just actors, who work in someone's script…  
>  anything we do not choose, unless you want to watch the show or not,  
>  that's all…

And it is echoed by a longer comment by _Dosanjani_ :

> Although I was too young to have participated in them, I remember the

Josipović has a daunting task ahead of him as Croatia is in a massive
recession and the country has very large goals to reach EU membership. It is
understandable that comments haven't been terribly forthcoming from Croatians
at large as they wait to see if new leadership will bring new economic growth
and stability.
