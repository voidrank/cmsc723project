The recent [ban imposed by France on burqa (niqab), the Islamic face
veil](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/world/europe/12france.html?_r=2&hp),
has created a lot of buzz across the different blogosphere of the world. The
law does not say anything explicitly about the burqa and it is called the
“[law forbidding the covering of the face in public
space](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=867DFAF2AAEE2A5003896DBB5D6337B1.tpdjo10v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000022911670&categorieLien=id)”.
But in effect it is all about Muslims and Islam.

Some South Asian bloggers have been discussing this issue.

Sadiq Alam at _Technology Of The Heart_
[provides](http://www.mysticsaint.info/2011/04/france-ban-face-veil-
burka.html) some background of banning of face veils in France and the the
2004 law banning the wearing of religious symbols and clothing in public
schools. He argues:

> Majority of Islamic scholars agree on the point that Full Face Veil is NOT
> something which is a requirement of Islam or mandatory to observe (even
> though some observe it believing it as part of their religious observation).
> Many Muslim leaders have said they support NEITHER the veil nor the ban.
> [..]
>
> Thanks to various culture from where people came and accepted Islam, various
> pre-existing dress code and idea of modesty became part of Muslim culture
> and they must be viewed as cultural element than religious. Dressing
> modestly is possible independent of culture, race, or existing practices of
> any other land or nation.

He comments on the French burqa ban:

> While its understandable that full face veil is not necessarily a religious
> obligation from Islamic point of view, but an age old cultural practice, yet
> banning it creates a very different situation for it. From the point of
> individual freedom this becomes some what disturbing. A state or country
> telling its citizen what to wear and what not to wear contradicts with
> democratic, civil values – the very values French republic so high upheld.

Journalist and blogger Dipika
[writes](http://dionthejob.blogspot.com/2011/04/world-of-bans.html) after
weighing on several issues:

> Perhaps there are women who want to be freed of wearing a veil at all times
> throughout their lives- and are secretly happy that now they can.
>
> But on thinking about this for a while, I come to the conclusion that this
> law is still wrong. Because my leaning towards this law is based on the
> assumption that the women actually don't want the veil, but are being forced

> us, may want to wear it! And if a single woman in France wants to wear a

> is wrong.

She concludes:

> All bans are wrong when they tread on your personal freedom. The ban on
> veils in France, and the ban on sale of tobacco in Bhutan.

To conclude the debate Sadiq is
[hopeful](http://www.mysticsaint.info/2011/04/france-ban-face-veil-burka.html)
that this ban may have a positive effect:

> The sum effect of banning of Burqa most probably going to have positive

> customs, educate themselves and separate cultural baggage from authentic

> non-Muslims about their beliefs and the fact that those who practice Islam
> do not belong to a Mono-Culture.
