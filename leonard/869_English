Blogger _hanoi scratchpad_ writes about his recent visit to a [dog meat
restaurant](http://hanoiscratchpad.blogspot.com/2010/01/eating-dog-in-
hanoi.html) in Hanoi, Vietnam.

> Dog eating has deep roots in Vietnam; it is a practice steeped in ritual,

The blogger learned that there are seven ways to cook dog in Vietnamese
cuisine. These seven dishes are:

> Rựa Mận – Steamed dog meat with shrimp paste, rice flour, and lemongrass  
>  Giềng Me Mắm Tôm – Steamed dog in shrimp paste, galangal, and rice vinegar  
>  Thịt Chó Hấp – Steamed dog meat  
>  Thịt Chó Nướng – Grilled dog meat  
>  Dồi Chó – Dog sausage  
>  Chó Xào Sả Ớt – Fried dog in lemongrass and chili  
>  Canh Xáo Măng Chó – Bamboo and dog meat soup

So how was the dog meat?

> While flavorful – save for the dog sausage, which I didn't particularly care
> for – there was little to make dog, as a flavor experience, particularly
> unique. Whereas lamb has a distinct taste that shines through most recipes,
> dog disappears into its method of preparation. When prepared like pork, it
> could just as easily be pork; when prepared like beef, it could just as
> easily be beef.

This anonymous commenter writes that [dog meat was non-existent in
Saigon](http://hanoiscratchpad.blogspot.com/2010/01/eating-dog-in-

_hanoi scratchpad_ recognizes that there are legitimate reasons why eating dog
meat should be prohibited but he dismisses the common arguments used by
[animal activists](http://hanoiscratchpad.blogspot.com/2010/01/morality-of-
eating-dog.html):

> Consider that Vietnam consumes an estimated four to five million dogs per
> year. This is roughly the number of cats and dogs that are annually

> the nation that eats them?

Dog meat is eaten in several countries including Vietnam’s neighboring
countries in Southeast Asia. Vutha is shocked to see [dog meat shops in Phnom
Penh](http://www.vuthasurf.com/2009/12/04/ban-the-sale-of-dog-meat-in-
cambodia/)

> There are small handfuls of Cambodian people like eating it.
>
> Nowadays, there are small shops using dog meat as food for people who like
> it in Phnom Penh. Most of dogs have been stolen and sold to dog shop.

Gloria Esguerra Melencio is aware that eating dog meat has a cultural and
historical basis in some indigenous groups in the Philippines but this
practice has been abused already. The writer explains in detail how some
[Filipino men prepare dog meat](http://philippinehistory.ph/asocena-history-
of-dog-meat-eating-in-the-philippines/):

> 1\. Strangle the dog from behind by surprise. Do this swiftly to prevent the
> dog from biting. Gag its mouth. Throw the dog in a waiting jeepney, tricycle
> or van. Drive as fast to avoid apprehension. When accosted though, bribe the
> barangay tanod or police with your crispy Php 500 bill. Should you bought
> the dog from a nearby area from an owner who is in dire need of money, put
> the dog in a sack. Carry the sack on your back.
>
> 2\. Remove the dog from the sack. Tie the dog in a post. Do not hear its
> barks, cries and howls for dear life. Hit its head with a two-by-two inch
> piece of lumber with a nail at the end. Do this several times until it is
> dead.
>
> 3\. Hang the lifeless dog on a tree branch or post upside down. Slit its
> throat. Place a basin underneath to catch blood. Sprinkle rice and salt on
> blood until it solidifies. (Blood of black dogs is a potent medicine against
> tuberculosis, says a folk belief in Negros.)
>
> 4\. Burn the dog coat with a flame thrower. Release the lifeless dog from
> the post. Shave until its smooth white skin shows.
>
> 5\. Slice to pieces. Wash.
>
> 6\. Put the dog meat in a kawa or a big pan. Boil in vinegar for an hour.
>
> 7\. Add a little water and sprinkle salt. Do not mix yet. Let it stand for a
> few more minutes.
>
> 8\. Cook again in low, cooking fire. Add potatoes, soy sauce and sprinkle
> with black pepper.
>
> 9\. Pour tomato sauce, tomato paste, yellow and green peas and garnish with
> plenty of laurel leaves.
>
> 10\. Serve with plenty of ice-cold beers or gin.
