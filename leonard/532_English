More than 340 people died and at least 550 were injured during a
[stampede](http://blog.andybrouwer.co.uk/2010/11/tragedy.html) over a bridge
connecting Koh Pich Island (Diamond Island) and Phnom Penh City during the
last hour of the last day of Cambodia’s Water Festival.

Azuriel provides an [eyewitness account](http://www.expat-
advisory.com/forum/asia/cambodia/phnom-penh-pub-expats-expats-
cambodia/diamond-island-bridge) of what happened during that tragic night

> …we were just about to cross back to the mainland from the island when the
> stampede started, and police started cordoning the area off.
>
> spent most of my 4 hours trying to help out, including performing CPR on 4
> girls that got fished out of the river … unfortunately only managed to
> revive 2 of them
>
> From talking to the locals, some of the security and event management staff,
> and first-hand experience, I gather the following chain of events occurred;
> not sure these events occurred in this order though, but it's close:
>
> \- about 30-odd people were electrocuted (few direct deaths, but many losing
> consciousness, suffering severe burns) from contact with the metal guard
> rails on either side of the bridge …  
>  – about a dozen people fainted from the crush of the crowd, heat
> exhaustion, dehydration, or a combination of these, and fell underfoot …  
>  – Crowd panicked from the electrocutions and surged into a stampede; More
> people tripped or got pushed over, and got trampled underfoot …  
>  – People started jumping off the bridge into the river below to escape the
> mob; some were electrocuted climbing over the railings; some died from
> jumping into shallow water, or missing the water altogether, and landing on
> the concrete escarpments.  
>  – Curious onlookers surged towards the bridge from both ends trying to find
> out what was going on. POLICE WERE VERY FORCEFULLY PUSHING BYSTANDERS BACK,
> USING FISTS, BATONS, PISTOLS, AND PIECES OF METAL PIPING!!!  
>  – Some police near the Koh Pich end of the bridge fired warning shops to
> try to disperse the crowd, but it only served to set off a 2nd panic, since
> no-one at that stage knew who was shooting, nor at who or what …  
>  – Around the same time, all the neon lights on the bridge were turned off,
> along with most of the street lamps along the eastern shore of the island.
>
> ironically, the bayon TV concert a couple of hundred metres away blasted on
> throughout all of this … … …

_The Sreisaat Adventures in Cambodia_ also heard that some kind of
[panic](http://www.sreisaat.com/2010/11/please-keep-cambodia-in-your-
thoughts.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+TheSreisaatAdventuresInCambodia+\(The+Sreisaat+Adventures+in+Cambodia\))
“event” triggered the stampede

> Today we woke up to a very somber Phnom Penh.
>
> The whole country is mourning the tragic death of hundreds of people during
> a stampede that broke out on Monday night. It was the last hour of the last
> day of what should have been a happy celebration of the Water Festival.
>
> There was confusion as to how the stampede started but, quoting a Khmerican
> friend's note in his Facebook wall, what credible sources are saying is that
> some type of event created a “panic” on the newly-built bridge. What kind of
> event, this we are hoping the query will yield the answers.
>
> I fervently hope that the culprits will be punished, that lessons will be
> learned so that incidents like this will never happen again. Ever.

_LTO Cambodia_ doesn’t want to
[blame](http://ltocambodia.blogspot.com/2010/11/water-festival-tragedy.html)
anyone yet for what happened last Monday

> I wish I had something profound to say. I wish I had some great insight to
> offer. I wish I could say why all this happened.
>
> I wish I could rail against somebody or something. I wish I could put this
> all on somebody else. Somehow it would seem that might help alleviate the
> sorrow over this disaster, if only a bit. But at this point we don't know
> exactly what happened or why. And recriminations, though understandable from
> those directly affected, are for the rest of us at this point only self-
> serving and perhaps unfair and damaging.

_Khmer Empire_ criticizes the [failure of
authorities](http://sokheounpang.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/the-assumptions-of-
the-cause-of-the-koh-pich-incident/) to prevent this tragedy

> We just wonder why this government is so capable to crackdown thousands of
> demonstrators and evicting the poor people while they are so incompetent so
> handle such a situation at Koh Pich?

A [condolence parade](http://www.expat-advisory.com/events/southeast-
asia/cambodia/condolence-parade) will be held this week; and some useful
hotline numbers for those who wish to help the victims

A _New Mandala_ reader
[predicted](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2010/11/23/prelude-to-
the-bridge-tragedy/) days before the tragedy that a stampede would probably
occur in the bridge

> As I crossed the bridge, squeezed in the crammed crowd of mostly families
> and young Cambodians, I had an overwhelming sense that the children near my
> feet would be crushed if the crowd surged. When I found cart vendors
> partially blocking the off ramp I became infuriated and cursed some of them,
> but the best I could do was manage to force the worst offender to move her
> cart to the side. It seemed like a hopeless situation. The bridge was too
> narrow for the crowd.

_Cambodia Calling_ notes that many of those who died came from the
[provinces](http://cambodiacalling.blogspot.com/2010/11/almost-400-dead-at-
water-festival.html) who travelled to the capital to enjoy the festivities

> Very sad day for Cambodians. As if their lives are not hard enough, the rare
> chance ordinary Khmers – many from the countryside who come to Phnom Penh to
> watch the annual boat race – had a chance to rejoice and celebrate, they met
> with tragedy.
>
> The Cambodian government has said it would compensate 5 million rielsm or
> USD1250 to the families of each of the dead and 1 million riels each to
> those injured
