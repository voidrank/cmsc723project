A sizable crowd gathered in the center of Skopje tonight to protest the death
of a young man who was allegedly beaten to death on the sidelines of the
celebration of election victory by the ruling political party.

The event coincided with
[Baskerfest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRRs5jGmtI), an annual street
performance art festival held in the [center of
Skopje](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.99644927,21.43177756).

squad, personal and command responsibility for the perpetrators of the crime,
and external control of the police abuse cases:
