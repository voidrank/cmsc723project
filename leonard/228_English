Are Singapore soldiers ready for battle? This is one of the many questions
raised by netizens who are reacting to the photo of a young serviceman whose
backpack is being carried by someone believed to be their family domestic
helper.

The photo was first uploaded on Facebook and immediately caught the attention
of the [media](http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC110406-0001207/NSFs-
punishment-too-soft). The serviceman has since then expressed his remorse over
his behavior and is now being counselled.

Senang Diri points out that the photo confirms the perception that Singapore
soldiers are [‘spoilt
softies’](http://kementah.blogspot.com/2011/03/singapores-defence-burden-
something-no.html):

> (The picture) sums up what the SAF’s detractors have long argued and what
> local authorities have taken pains to correct – that Singapore’s national
> servicemen are soft city boys. Spoilt softies, pampered by mummy and daddy,
> fussed over by a domestic helper, unfit for battle, potential liabilities in
> combat clearly not up to the mark for the rigours of warfare. You don’t need
> a picture caption to figure this out, do you?

_rogerpoh_ [blames parents](http://rogerpoh.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/maid-
carrying-his-backpack-nsman-under-fire-part-2/) for the poor discipline of
Singapore children:

> The root of the problem in part lies in the poor school discipline
> prevailing in our schools. A soft approach to discipline in our schools is
> breeding generations of spoilt and ill-disciplined students seconded by
> their parents.

_Loh and Behold_ drafts this [satirical
letter](http://lohandbehold.com/?p=10825) to illustrate his point:

> Our dearest Wussy darling,
>
> You are famous!
>
> Your picture is everywhere!
>
> And our entire nation is waiting with bated breath for you to turn around
> and show your face but son, daddy and mummy suggest that you press on and
> proceed without flinching.
>
> Keep those losers guessing son, and don’t you ever dare carry your own
> backpack!
>
> For your future is bright, dear Wussy, and daddy and mummy, for your own
> sake, cannot bear to see you get hurt or injured by such trivial, menial
> tasks as carrying your own backpack, loaded full with fortifying goodness
> like ginseng, bak kwa, chicken essence and several cans of abalone for your
> midnight snack. (The can opener is in the side pocket on the left, darling
> son.)

_Mr. Brown_ urges the public not to be [“too
harsh”](http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2011/03/maid-for-the-army.html) on the
boy:

> I think we should not be too harsh on the boy. He is, after all, doing what
> Singapore likes to do: getting foreigners to do work that we don't want to
> do ourselves.

_Want some tau huay?_ also blames bad parenting but also
[asks](http://tauhuayboy.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/pampered-soldiers-blame-the-
parents/) why 18 year old Singaporeans are considered mature enough to hold a
rifle but too young to vote:

> Yes, the boy is in the wrong in asking the maid to hold his field pack, but
> the blame lies squarely on the shoulders of the parents.
>
> The argument is that since 18 year olds are already taught to hold a rifle
> (18 is the age where Singaporean males are conscripted), why can’t they have
> a say in Singapore’s politics? I hold firm to this argument. But pictures
> like those above doesn’t help people like me in our quest for the voting the
> age to be reduced.

_Singapore Kopi Tok_ believes that the soldier’s photo [damaged the
image](http://singaporekopitok.blogspot.com/2011/04/pack-mulemaid-and-nsf-not-
packing-punch.html) of the army:

> This soldier has done the SAF a disservice. It may be only one case, but it
> has damaged the reputation of the service, and all others who don the
> uniform with pride.
>
> To all serving SAF national servicemen. Carry your own field pack and polish
> your own boots; a soldier’s pride demands no less.

_Vicky's Writings_ thinks the boy belongs to the generation of
[schoolchildren](http://vickychong.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/generation-gap/)
who grew up with maids carrying their school bags:

> He is probably one of the thousands of boys and girls who had grown up
> having their maids carry their school bags. I had written in my blog here
> before, of a boy in my neighbourhood whose maid had to carry his school bag
> from his house to the school bus waiting at the gate, barely 10m away.
> (Shake my head as I recall.
>
> My boys are due for enlistment next year. I showed them the news and they
> were adamant that we are making a mountain out of a molehill. What’s wrong
> with that? Adults like to complaint about every little things we do.
