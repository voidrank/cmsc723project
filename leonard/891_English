With phone lines being restored in Haiti, money sent from families abroad “by
wire” is again arriving, and helping reconstruction even where international
aid has not arrived. Remittances from family members living abroad represented
at least [thirty
percent](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache%3Axjc6-rs5pZoJ%3Aisim.georgetown.edu%2FPublications%2FRCRCCPubs%2FOrozco%2FUnderstanding%2520the%2520remittance%2520economy%2520in%2520Haiti.pdf+remittances+haiti&hl=es&gl=es&sig=AHIEtbRlbYi_-f5hZmlXhXM218J6qzs0kg&pli=1)
of Haiti's Gross National Product before the January 12 earthquake.

The two largest Haitian communities outside Haiti are those in the Dominican
Republic and[ the United
States](http://www.migrationinformation.org/Usfocus/display.cfm?ID=214#1).
Between 400 thousand and 600 thousand Haitian citizens call each of the
neighboring nations home. Another 80-100 thousand live in other Caribbean
nations or in France.
[This](http://www.iadb.org/mif/remesas_map.cfm?language=English) chart from
the Inter-American Development bank, based on a 2006 study, claims that
Haitians living in the United States sent nearly $1.9 billion home annually.

The collapse of telephone service and, in some cases the buildings that housed
banks and remittance offices, had temporarily cut off that money. But this
week long lines were visible outside money transfer offices, such as this CAM
office in Carrefour, southeast of Port au Prince, photographed by GV's Georgia
Poppelwell.

Though the capital has received the bulk of media attention, it's not
necessarily where the money sent by family members abroad will arrive. The
[International Association of Money Transfer
Networks](http://www.iamtn.org/about), an industry association which
represents companies that carry electronic money transfers, says that about
half the funds wired to Haiti from the US, the largest source of remittances,
is sent to rural areas. That's significant because those areas are also seeing
an increase in population, as people displaced by the quake [go to live with
family and friends in
hometowns](http://www.buffalonews.com/180/story/930981.html) and less-damaged
areas.

Dilip Ratha, a World Bank economist, argues at the bank's
[blog](http://blogs.worldbank.org/peoplemove/helping-haiti-through-migration-
and-remittances) that remittances could hold a more important role with the
[emergency extension of “temporary protected” immigration
status](http://immigration.change.org/blog/view/united_states_grants_temporary_protected_status_to_haitian_immigrants)
(“TPS) to as many as 200 thousand Haitians living in the US.
