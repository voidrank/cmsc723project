[Mir Hussein Mousavi ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi)and
[Mehdi Karroubi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Karroubi), two leading
figures in Iran's opposition have formally [asked
](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9G1TFBG0)authorities
for permission to hold a rally on the anniversary of the disputed the [ June
12 presidential
election](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/iranian-
election-2009/). They expressed their concern for the safety of protesters in
a joint statement.

Several Iranians disagreed with this cautious behavior online, and many have
published posters encouraging tomorrow's demonstration (like one in above) in
blogs and on websites.

_Webneveshteha_[encourages ](http://iranian-
green.blogspot.com/2010/06/22.html) [fa] people to chant _Allaho Akbar_ (God
is Great) on their rooftops today as they did during post election crisis as a
sign of protest to the Iranain government. The blogger adds:

> if you open the window and you hear no voice, go to your rooftop and chant
> _Allaho Akbar_. You are the media.

_Dulatemeli_ writes [fa]:

> We will be side by side with the mothers of martyrs, Mr. Mousavi and Mr.
> Karoubi you can join us too. If we do not show up on 12th of June the

this regime or to topple this regime, and that the regime has lost its
legitimacy.

“I am an ordinary citizen and I am a leader of this movement. Tomorrow I will
go from Tehran's university to Azadi Square in Tehran. Will you come with me?
Freedom has a cost.”
