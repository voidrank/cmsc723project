_To Shoot An Elephant_ is a documentary by Spaniard Alberto Arce and
Palestinian Mohammad Rujailah, filmed in Gaza during [the war a year
ago](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2008-gaza-strip-
bombings/). To mark the first anniversary of the end of the war, the film,
released under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licence, was
shown at special screenings [around the
world](http://community.toshootanelephant.com/).

_Hisham_ , a Moroccan blogger based in France, has written about the film on
his blog _[the Mirror](http://almiraatblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/shooting-

> _[To Shoot an Elephant](http://toshootanelephant.com/node)_ is a documentary

> Crescent](http://www.palestinercs.org/) ambulances during the 21 days of
> Operation Cast Lead launched by Israel against the besieged Palestinian
> people of Gaza exactly one year ago. The assault started in December 27th,
> 2008, and lasted until January 18th, 2009. Horrific days of endless
> bombardments, random sniping of children, women, elderly, rescue workers –
> bombings of civilian areas, hospitals, ambulances, schools, mosques, UN
> headquarters that resulted in the killing of over 1,400 Palestinians, almost
> entirely civilians and the death of 13 Israelis. [A global
> screening](http://community.toshootanelephant.com/) of the film was
> organized around the planet commemorating the first anniversary of the end
> of the assault.

The foreign activists featured in the documentary include Italian [_Vittorio
Arrigoni_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/12/from-italy-to-palestine-

The film was also screened in _[Second
Life](http://mediaoriente.com/2010/01/18/to-shoot-an-elephant-live-on-second-
life-today/)_ , the [3D virtual
world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life).

_Hisham_ attended a screening of _To Shoot An Elephant_ in
[Paris](http://almiraatblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/shooting-an-elephant/):

> The Film is a slap in the face. People are justifiably moved by images

> horrific [earthquake](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/haiti-
> earthquake-2010/) lately, but I guess the emotion is taken to a new level
> when the disaster is so conspicuously man-made, unjustifiable (indeed
> illegal), and avoidable. An overwhelming sense of anger together with
> feelings of injustice, helplessness and shock makes the experience even more
> compelling and engaging. I, for one, feared that the film would drift too
> much into a mere pornography of death and misery. I also was anxious to see
> whether the film would end up preaching for the converted. All in all it is
> a real, unformatted, unmanicured eye witness account about what really
> happens when ordinary people got bombed and collectively punished whether in
> [Guernica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Guernica), in Warsaw or
> in Gaza. And although, for the sake of preserving human dignity, I might
> have some contention about where the limits of filming agonizing people and
> dead bodies should lie, I still want to believe the film respected the
> suffering victims it happened to film.
