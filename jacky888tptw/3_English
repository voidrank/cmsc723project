Screenshot of numerous video testimonies by young people who are documenting
their journey as they leave Venezuela.

It is difficult to determine exactly how many Venezuelans have left their
country.

The international press insists that the number reported by the Venezuelan
government remains
[“questionable”](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/venezuela-exodo-crisis-
migracion-kay-guerrero-conclusiones/). The most recent
[data](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/08/1017642) from the [United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/08/1017642)
puts the number at around two million people — a report which the Venezuelan
government and its allies have [labeled as false.](http://misionverdad.com/MV-
IN-ENGLISH/fallacies-and-inaccuracies-about-venezuelan-migration)

What can be seen is the increase virtual support networks and everyday
Venezuelans who are taking to social media to share their stories,
recommendations, and personal reflections as they make their way out of the
country — giving a voice and a face to the dire statistics.

### **Personal stories and networks of solidarity**

Yosy, a 23-year-old Venezuelan woman, is one of the many people who seek to
record their stories and to help others embarking on the same journey. On her
[YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8rcNCUW1Luv6nyJdZOD5w/featured),
she describes her migration experience, first to Panama and then to Argentina.
In addition to her adaptation process, she also reflects on the reasons she
decided to leave:

> En mi país no hay medicinas, no hay doctores, no hay salud. En mi país todos
> los días hay muertes. En mi país no hay comida, pero sí hay desnutrición. En
> mi país no hay seguridad, pero sí mucha violencia. […] ¿Te sorprende? A
> nosotros ya no.

> In my country, there is no medicine, there are no doctors, there is no
> healthcare. In my country, there is death every day. In my country, there is
> no food, but there is malnutrition. In my country, there is no security, but
> there is a lot of violence. […] Are you surprised? We aren't anymore.

Dozens of YouTube videos with titles like “[My trip to Peru without a
passport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtBvO62z9I)“, “[9 Tips for Getting
to Cúcuta, Colombia from
Venezuela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmBbGG3r6MQ)” and “[My journey by
land to Chile from Venezuela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN-tyapqQ0M)”
are available through a simple search. All of them contain personal stories
illustrating the Venezuelan exodus and act as a guide for those planning to do
the same.

In each video, viewers can see the hardships and risks for those traveling by
land. For example, in her “9 Tips”, Youtube user Oriana shares the potential
risks that people can encounter in bus terminals as well as ordeals with legal
documents:

> De Cúcuta a Bogotá, o a cualquier ciudad cercana debe haber por lo menos
> como 20 puntos de control en donde los policías de migración se suben al
> autobús y revisan las identificaciones para ver si los pasaportes están
> sellados. [Todo] debido a la descontrolada migración de venezolanos al
> territorio colombiano […] En el terminal de Cúcuta tienes que ir a el sótano
> si deseas guardar maletas bañarte o utilizar el baño. Tiene que ser
> estrictamente en el sótano pues es la única zona que es casi segura. Las
> afueras de los terminales son muy peligrosos…

> From Cúcuta to Bogotá, or any nearby city, there should be at least 20
> checkpoints where the immigration police get on the bus, check IDs and see
> if passports are duly stamped. [All] due to uncontrolled Venezuelan
> immigration into Colombian territory […] In the Cúcuta terminal you have to
> go to the basement if you want to store your luggage, shower, or use the
> bathroom. You have to be strict with this: the basement is the only zone
> that is almost safe. Areas outside of these terminals are extremely
> dangerous…

Meanwhile, a number of Venezuelan communities abroad have created Facebook
groups, and use Twitter and other social networks to give support and advice
in destinations like
[Colombia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1684288985200124/?ref=br_rs),
[Ecuador](https://www.facebook.com/groups/venezolanosenecuadorquito/?ref=br_rs),
[Chile](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1738379549763952/?ref=br_rs), and
[Spain](https://www.facebook.com/groups/venezolanospeninsulaiberica/?ref=br_rs)
— a virtual solidarity network for those who must leave their country.

### Other means of help

The situation for Venezuelans leaving the country has worried some NGOs that
support migrants. Among them, the Jesuit Network for Migrants and the Jesuit
Service for Refugees from Latin American and the Caribbean who have [designed
a “virtual map”](http://puntodecorte.com/descargable-jesuistas-guia-para-
migrantes-venezolanos-con-rutas-tramites-y-precios/) in order to help with
people's safety while traveling to Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador or Peru. The
project is another example of the magnitude of the Venezuelan exodus, now
considered to be [the largest in the region](http://www.el-
nacional.com/noticias/bbc-mundo/exodo-venezolano-mayor-latinoamerica-los-
ultimos-anos_249232) in the last 50 years.

jesuistas-guia-para-migrantes-venezolanos-con-rutas-tramites-y-precios/)

Detailed “virtual route” developed by the Migrant Jesuit Network, the Jesuit
Service for Latin American Refugees, and The Caribbean in order to help
immigrants. The guide shows data and organization information that can help
those undertaking the journey from Venezuela to other countries in the region.
It also has a list of information about transportation prices, times, and
routes.

Apart from the route itself, it's important to remember the harsh conditions
that Venezuelans face as they prepare their travels. On the one hand, there
are complicated and numerous limitations when accessing legal documents. Being
able to hold a passport, for example, can mean waiting [up until two
years](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/la-odisea-de-obtener-el-pasaporte-en-
venezuela-pkg-jorge-perez-valery/) or [paying
extra](https://www.abc.es/internacional/abci-hasta-1000-dolares-piden-renovar-
pasaporte-venezolano-201807150428_noticia.html) to get it printed or renewed.
On the other hand, the spectacular and [unstoppable
hyperinflation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/20/venezuela-
bolivars-hyperinflation-banknotes) (projected to reach [a million percent in
2018](https://www.nytimes.com/es/2018/07/24/inflacion-venezuela-record/)) that
makes any budget change significantly by the day.

It remains to be seen what solutions could help solve the immense challenges
taking place inside and outside the country. So far, as the numbers behind the
exodus (as well as the [tensions with neighboring
countries)](https://www.playgroundmag.net/now/fuera-nicas-fuera-venezolanos-
una-ola-de-xenofobia-recorre-latinoamerica_30446129.html) continue to rise,
the Venezuelan migration phenomenon doesn't show any sign it's slowing down.
