The theme of the 2018 [human rights law
conference](https://www.monash.edu/law/research/centres/castancentre/public-
events/conferences/human-rights-2018/annual-human-rights-conference-
program-2018) of Monash University’s Castan Centre, in Melbourne, Australia,
was best summed up by Kristen Hilton, Equal Opportunity and Human Rights
Commissioner of the state of Victoria: “We cannot just support human rights
until it gets hard”.

She was talking about the 2017 controversy over [youth
detention](https://www.amnesty.org.au/barwon-cie-success/) in adult prison.
Anti-discrimination lawyer and member of the [Fair
Agenda](https://www.fairagenda.org/board) board, Kamna Muddagouni tweeted:

> Human rights and policy around human rights doesn't led itself to a five
> second media grab, it requires time, thought and reflection, not just a
> legal answer, but an answer thinking about morality, ethics, religion,
> philosophy as well –

At a time when rights are embattled both locally and globally, the annual
event in Melbourne explored many of the topical issues facing both Australia
and countries in the region.

Jesuit Catholic priest Father Frank Brennan spoke about religion and rights.
He is a member of the expert panel set up by the Federal government to examine
the question of religious freedom, following the [legalization of same sex
marriage](https://globalvoices.org/2017/12/14/we-are-one-same-sex-marriage-
becomes-legal-down-under/) in Australia in 2017.

Frank had advocated a vote in favor of equal marriage during a [national
survey](https://globalvoices.org/2017/11/16/the-winner-is-same-sex-marriage-
equality-in-australia/).

In his presentation, he argued that national human rights legislation would
help to clarify religious rights, but doubted that would happen:

> A national Charter of human rights is still best way to balance rights incl
> freedom of religion –

Professor Megan Davis looked at the state of indigenous rights and
reconciliation following the [government’s rejection of
“](http://theconversation.com/why-the-government-was-wrong-to-reject-an-
indigenous-voice-to-parliament-86408)[The Uluru Statement from the
heart”](https://www.1voiceuluru.org/the-statement/). The 2017 statement by the
First Nations Convention called “for the establishment of a First Nations
Voice enshrined in the Constitution’ and a process for agreement-making with
governments and ‘truth-telling’ about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
history”.

Her message was clear:

The issue of treaties is always contentious in Australia. But Megan brought
some humour:

Activist Habiburahman did not hold back in his demands for strong action on
the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar:

Human rights lawyer George Newhouse from the [National Justice
Project](https://justice.org.au/) gave an equally depressing picture of the
treatment of asylum seekers held in the Manus Island and the Nauru [offshore
detention](https://globalvoices.org/2017/11/09/humanitarian-crisis-escalates-
at-australias-refugee-detention-centre-in-papua-new-guinea/) centres:

In contrast, Ivy Josiah was more optimistic about recent developments in her
country in her presentation “You Can't Beat A Woman – Women's Human Rights in
Malaysia”:

Employment lawyer Josh Bornstein painted a bleaker picture for worker’s rights
in Australia in his “Requiem for the right to strike”. He covered a lot of
ground, including quite a bit of history:

The final presenter was the CEO of Greenpeace Australia Pacific David Ritter,
who gave a rousing appeal to join the opposition to
[Adani](http://www.adaniaustralia.com/)’s proposed Carmichael coal mine in the
Queensland Galilee Basin. It’s part of their [Coal-free
future](https://www.greenpeace.org.au/what-we-do/creating-a-coal-free-future/)
campaign:

Lawyers from Victoria Legal Aid have [shared their
impressions](https://www.legalaid.vic.gov.au/about-us/news/upholding-
importance-of-human-rights) of the day on their website. Sam Drummond, whose
tweet is included above, reflected on Ivy Josiah's contribution:

> ‘I’ve spent much of the last year in Malaysia working with human rights
> organisations, so it was terrific to hear from Malaysian women’s rights
> activist Ivy Josiah.
>
> ‘The conversation about human rights in Malaysia is completely different to
> the one we are used to hearing, and there are clearly lessons we can take
> from each other.
>
> ‘Ivy stressed the importance of taking risks and impressed on us the ‘need
> to hold hands with our fellow human rights groups’.

Videos of the panel presentations and Q&A sessions should be available soon on
the [Castan Centre YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CastanCentre/videos)
channel. There is also a series of videos [Have You Got That
Right?](http://www.haveyougotthatright.com/#video) that explores a wide range
of topics.
