Indians were overcome with joy on Thursday, September 6, after the country's
Supreme Court unanimously ruled the 157-year-old law that criminalized
homosexual sex unconstitutional.

[Section
377](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377_of_the_Indian_Penal_Code) of
the Indian Penal Code was a legacy of the British empire, who around the
mid-19th century imposed many laws criminalizing homosexual acts across its
colonies.

In a historic verdict, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra
[said](https://www.thebetterindia.com/158760/section-377-dipak-misra-supreme-
court-lgbtq/):

> Majoritarian views and popular views cannot dictate constitutional rights.
> LGBT community possesses human rights like all other sections of society.
> Equality is the essence of the constitution. 377 is arbitrary.

Back in 2013, the Delhi High Court ruled Section 377
[unconstitutional](https://globalvoices.org/2014/08/26/indias-lgbt-community-
dares-to-hope-after-health-ministers-comment-on-gay-rights/), but this had
been
[overturned](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Section_377_-_CIVIL_APPEAL_NO.10972_OF_2013_Judgement.pdf)
shortly after by the Supreme Court.

The latest Supreme Court's decision has brought joy to people across the
country, gay or otherwise. On social media, many acknowledged that such
victory [is the result](https://www.thetealmango.com/featured/the-overturning-
of-section-377-is-the-result-of-years-of-work-by-indias-lgbt-community/) of
years of activism by India’s LGBT community.

[said](https://www.facebook.com/jayna.kothari/posts/10160851101985322?amp%3B__tn__=H-R):

Others cheered the decision on Twitter:

The decision will not reflect in Indian-administered [Jammu and
Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir) state as it has its
own constitution and criminal law, the [Ranbir Penal
Code,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranbir_Penal_Code) which still
criminalizes non-heterosexual sexual intercourse. Dr. Ajaz Ahmad Bund, a
social worker in Kashmir,
[told](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/section-377-pride-not-
extended-to-

the Times of India:

> The Supreme Court judgment, I am hoping, will now initiate a debate and
> awareness about what it means to be gay or lesbian or transgender in
> Kashmir.
