More than four months after he was arrested, the whereabouts of Yemeni writer
Marwan Almuraisy remain unknown. He was last seen in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
where he resides.

Security officers arrested Almuraisy on June 1. [Human rights
organisations](https://www.gc4hr.org/news/view/1954) say he was transferred to
an unknown location and that he is being held incommunicado:

> Al-Muraisy's family have been denied information about the charges against
> him, the location where he is being held and are unable to visit him.

It remains unclear why he was arrested. On his
[personal](https://twitter.com/almuraisy?lang=en) Twitter account, where he
has nearly 100 thousand followers, he mostly tweeted on news related to
technology, innovation and science. He also posted motivational tweets and
videos to inspire others.

Al-Muraisy had done some reporting for the privately-owned Saudi website Sabq
and other outlets including the non-profit Science and Development Network
([Scidev.net)](https://www.scidev.net/global/author.marwan-almuraisy.html)
that focused on science and technology.

According to his bio on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7846456._), Al-Muraisy
managed a number of Twitter accounts including the
[@WorldInNumbers](https://twitter.com/WorldInNumbers), which provided world
data and statistics to an Arabic audience,
[@ArabicShortFilm](https://twitter.com/ArabicShortFilm) dedicated to short
films in Arabic, and [@3bqr](https://twitter.com/3bqr), where he posted mental
puzzles, although these accounts have been inactive since 2015. He is also a
co-founder at CV Graphic, a tech business that creates professional curricula
vitae in the format of infographics. In January 2014, Almuraisy published a
book, _Lbn ala’sfour_ (Milk of the bird), in which he reproduced 140 funny
tweets posted by Arabic-speaking users.

Almuraisy's disappearance puzzled his supporters, particularly given that he
was not publicly involved in political or human rights activism, which are
common targets for the Saudi authorities.

Under the de facto rule of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, it seems that
political and human rights-related issues are no longer the only targets.
There appears to be a mandate to stamp out “independent” voices — the words of
anyone who is not writing in service of the kingdom's leadership or political
agenda. Bin Salman came into his position of power in July 2017, but it is
only now, as he faces[ accusations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-
east-45968185) of playing a role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
that heads of state and other global leaders are pressuring him on the issue.

In an analysis of media repression in the kingdom, published before
Khashoggi's disappearance, the [Committee to Protect
Journalists’](https://cpj.org/blog/2018/09/new-saudi-arabia-ushers-in-even-
more-repressive-cl.php) Justin Shilad wrote:

CPJ is investigating the possible jailing of at least 10 other journalists
since Salman took power. Those arrested under his de facto rule of the kingdom
include women's rights activists who campaigned for women's right to drive, a
policy reform the crown prince himself [supported and
led](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/22/middleeast/saudi-women-driving-ban-
end-intl/index.html).
