attend a ceremony on the occasion of Nawruz.

For many living in the part of Eurasia where Persian and Turkic languages
dominate, the festivities of Nawruz beginning March 21 mark not just the start
of spring, but New Year itself.

In Afghanistan, however, the occasion is not universally celebrated, and the
holiday's pagan roots are a point of conjecture between different groups.

Moreover, the warmer weather also brings with it a traditional uptick
insurgent violence.

This year, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has attempted to check the onslaught
with a renewed and emboldened offer of peace to the Taliban. But there is no
sign yet that the group is ready to sign up for talks.

## Your Nawruz, not my Nawruz

Social media timelines were flooded with good wishes and hopes for peace and
stability as Nawruz (also spelled Nowruz and Noruz) arrived last month.
Celebrations of the spring equinox observed by the ancient Zoroastrians
continue well into April.

However, religious hardliners have little time for the holiday, and Facebook
was once again a platform to witness the country's divides, as much as its
togetherness.

In one popular post, conservative public figure Hiatu Adden Sahebi

residents of Mazar-i-Sharif in the strongest terms not to mark Sizadabar, the
13th day of Nawruz, on April 2.

As usual, however, the day saw families take advantage of the warming weather
by camping out in the hills and holding feasts.

## Another difficult year ahead

This year Nawruz was marred by tragedy, after a suicide bomber [blew up
himself](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-blast/suicide-bomber-
kills-more-than-30-near-shrine-in-afghan-capital-idUSKBN1GX0NZ) near a Shiite
shrine in Kabul March 21, claiming at least 32 lives and wounding scores of
others.

The militant group ISIS [claimed
responsibility](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/suicide-bomber-in-
kabul-afghan-new-year/article23310455.ece) for the bombing, saying the attack
targeted Shi’ites.

Spring is also the period that sees the Taliban intensify its attacks on the
Western-backed government, with civillians typically caught in the crossfire.

At the end of February Afghan President Ashraf Ghani [reached
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/world/asia/afghan-taliban-peace-
talks.html) to the Taliban with an unprecedented offer of peace that included
the possibility of the group being able to form its own political party.

The peace offer was made “without preconditions” and pledged security for the
Taliban and their families if the group disarmed.

Taliban members would also have their names removed from blacklists maintained
by the United Nations and the United States under the proposed agreement.

However, the group that has swathes of Afghanistan under its control despite
splintering has yet to provide an official response to Ghani's offer.
