If it's quiet on[ Global Voices](https://globalvoicesonline.org/) the next
couple of days, it's because we've transported around 80 of our editors,
authors, and translators to Budapest, Hungary for a Summit about online
freedom of expression, citizen media, and the role of Global Voices in the
next year. You can follow all of us live throughout the day via
[webcast](https://summit08.globalvoicesonline.org/stream/), liveblog, Twitter,
and [photos](https://summit08.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/06/27/photos-gv-
citizen-media-summit-june-27/). See how, on our [Summit
website](https://summit08.globalvoicesonline.org/).

Many Global Voices bloggers who have worked together virtually for more than a
year are meeting here face to face for the first time. It's a public meeting
that has attracted around 200 participants from all continents, including over
two dozen journalists from mainstream media. Thank you to everyone who is here
in Budapest, or following from abroad.
