Today marks the seventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the US, a
pivotal day in history and a day which brought about so much heartbreak and
destruction not only in the US but around the world. Bloggers from the Middle
East reflect on the disaster.

Jordanian [_Hareega_](http://hareega.blogspot.com/2008/09/911s.html) wishes it
never happened:

> I wish it never happened. It could and should have been prevented.
>
> You may ask, how come I'm still remembering this event even though most
> Americans (82% on today's CNN poll) are not doing anything significant to
> mark it?
>
> I don't believe in conspiracy theories. I do believe that it was those 19
> low-life men that flew those planes into the towers and into the Pentagon,
> and doubt that the US government had an active role in bombing the towers or
> shooting the planes. I am buying all of this.

But what infuriates him the most is what happened on September 12:

> I'm just not buying anything from 9/12 afterwards.
>
> I can't buy how the CIA could not have prevented this attack, or why wasn't
> anyone fired from the administration for not preventing them. Why wasn't
> anyone from the government held responsible in a country where it's
> “rumored” that every adult is responsible for his or her own mistakes?
>
> How come all the warnings before the attacks were ignored, and different key
> figures in the government gave contradictory testimonies without being
> forced to say the truth?
>
> How does the US expect the world to take it as an example for democracy when
> the very democracy brought criminals like Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rice
> into office, and the same democracy failed miserably to make them pay for
> the lies that wasted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and
> shattered the whole country of Iraq.

His anger continues:

> There are several reasons for me to wish 9/11 never happened. It's the 3000
> victims, and those who were murdered in retaliation. None of them should
> have died, and those responsible for their deaths were not held accountable
> and will never be held accountable in a country that claims to be the leader
> of the democratic world. They just proved that all murderers are punished
> unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets, and that the
> first victim when war comes is truth.

Fellow Jordanian Qwaider, at [_Memories
Documented_](http://blog.sweetestmemories.com/default.asp?Display=1523), takes
a trip back in time. The blogger, who lives in the US, was vacationing in
Jordan at the time:

> I remember exactly what I was doing, who I was with, and how we all reacted,
> that warm September afternoon 7 years ago, as someone rushed into the room
> to say, you won't believe what's on CNN!

Qwaider adds:

> Then followed the difficult times, the “random” screenings at the airports,
> the profiling, the visits by the FBI, the wiretapping, the no-liquids-or-
> gels on flights, the you-can't-argue-with-stewardess-or-you'll-end-up-in-
> Guantanamo-bay. Everything
>
> That day, was the day when many civil liberties died… Many people continue
> to suffer it's aftermath, and chances are, the world will never be the same
> way again.
>
> I will never forget that day …

Still in Jordan,
[_Kinziblogs_](http://kinziblogs.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/remembering-911/)
also remembers the day clearly:

> I stood frozen with my dishtowel clutched to my chest as I understood that
> someone had actually planned to fly two planes into two office buildings,
> plotted to destroy the lives of whoever got in the way. Our guest
> immediately said: “This was Osama Bin Laden’s work”. I had no idea who he
> was. His almost-fiance said: “Please God, don’t let it be Arabs who did
> this, the world hates us enough already”.

And [_MommaBean_](http://a-tale-of-three-beans.blogspot.com/2008/09/moment-of-
silence-in-memory-of-one-of.html) remembers Ramzi Doany, a Christian
Palestinian who was killed on the day:

> I didn't know Ramzi personally. But, as I'm sure you all know, Amman is a
> VERY small town. It's so small that when the World Trade Center was
> destroyed on September 11, 2001, one of our own was lost. Ramzi was not only
> from Jordan, he was not only Palestinian, he was not only Christian, he was
> a member of our family. Although we weren't related (even by marriage), we
> were related by faith, by worship, by practice. Ramzi was one of those
> American myths, the forgotten, the glossed over: the Palestinian Christian…
>
> And when those planes went down, I listened to little-thinking colleagues
> talk about “those Palestinians” who were rejoicing. I explained that “those
> Palestinians” were mourning one of their sons. You would be foolish to think
> that out of nearly 3000 people, a Palestinian wasn't killed.

From Israel, [_Aussie Dave_](http://www.israellycool.com/2008/09/11/seven-
years-on/) writes a few observations on the anniversary. Among them are:

> * Seven years on, and people still don’t get what this war is about. Heck,
> most people still don’t get that we are in a war at all.
>
> * Al Jazeera (predictably) reports a poll which suggests that more than 50
> per cent of people “reject the official belief that the attacks on the World
> Trade Centre on September 11, 2001, were carried out by al-Qaeda.” Of
> particular interest:
>
> Of the countries surveyed, Egypt and Jordan had the highest percentages of
> people who believed Israel was behind the attack, polling 43 and 31 per cent
> respectively.

Palestinian [_Haitham
Sabbah_](http://sabbah.biz/mt/archives/2008/09/11/international-poll-who-was-
behind-911/) links to a _WorldPublicOpinion.org_ poll of 17 nations, where the
majority in only nine countries points the finger to Al Qaeda as being behind
the attacks. Jordan's [_The Black Iris_](http://www.black-
iris.com/2008/09/11/on-believing-israel-was-behind-911/) also reflects on the
polls, describing the day as what “eventually paved the way for a great deal
of horrific days outside the US.”

On Lebanese blog _The Ouwet Front_ , which reflects the personal views and
opinions of the Lebanese Forces members,[
_N10452_](http://www.ouwet.com/n10452/world-news-politics/remembering-911/)
writes:

> May all those who died in this terrorist attack rest in peace.

> 7 years from that date, terrorism is still spreading and more victims are

>  USA has failed to assimilate the terrorist threat unfortunatelly, but my

September 11 marks another anniversary for Iraqi
[_Ladybird_](http://www.roadstoiraq.com/2008/09/11/today%e2%80%99s-memorial-
occupation-day-2000/):

> Today 11 September 2008 is exactly the day 2000 since the U.S. occupied Iraq
> under the name “liberating Iraq”. Thanks to _Al-Akhbar_ article as a
> reminder of achievements of this “liberation”:
>
> In 2000 days, about 1 million Iraqis killed and 4 million displaced which is
> the biggest exodus largest since the Palestinian refugee crisis in 1948. As
> for the American side there are 4155 dead soldiers and 30324 injured, add to
> this 176 dead Brits and 138 dead from other nationalities.
>
> The costs of the occupation exceeded 1 trillion dollar, most of it is paid
> by the American taxpayer.

For Israeli [_Yael_](http://olehgirl.com/?p=1168), the world has changed since
September 11 in “unimaginable ways.” She adds:

> It changed far beyond the huge hole left in the Manhattan skyline, the tall
> and magnificent buildings stretching skyward with their lights that used to
> fill my view as I sipped coffee on my couch and wondered about the lives of
> those working so late and providing me, by their office lights, almost a
> magical experience every evening of every day. Those buildings, lights, and
> lives disappeared seven years ago today but a lot more disappeared with
> them.
>
> The change went beyond Manhattan, and it went beyond the U.S., and it went
> beyond the wars that destructive, senseless, inconceivable act sparked in
> Afghanistan and in Iraq. The entire world changed. While the world and the
> people of Manhattan and Washington have returned to their everyday lives,
> their daily routines, a banal normality, it is a new normality that we all
> live with. The world not only seems a far less safe place but is in fact
> less safe.

Yael continues:

> September 11, 2001 ushered in a worldwide intifada. Since that day,
> terrorist plots have been fostered and foiled in nearly every Western
> country –including countries that before have seen no acts of terrorism
> directed against their lands, such as Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark —
> and some of those terrorist plots have succeeded. It has heightened the acts
> of terror in those countries that are far too familiar with terrorism such
> as in India, Indonesia, Spain and across the Middle East.

[_One Jerusalem_](http://www.onejerusalem.com/2008/09/11/7-years-to-911/)
agrees that the world has indeed changed from that day, and poses the
following questions:

> What would the world be like if there was no 9/11? Would America still go to
> war in Afghanistan and Iraq? Would George W. Bush still be elected for a
> second term? Would the Georgian conflict and the possible emergence of a
> second Cold War still be happening?

Jordanian blogger [_Ali_](http://alidahmash.blogspot.com/2008/09/911-and-my-
check-list.html) too has a question:

> Today is the sad 7th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, it is not really an
> anniversary but remembering the 3000 innocent lives lost in that day. It
> should be a time for all to remember the dead in a day that realy have
> changed America and the whole world. What have the American government
> really accomplished so far, is America safer now?

He also compiles a list of how the world was pre and after 9/11.

And for [_Teachthemasses's School
Days_](http://teachthemasses.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/fire-in-the-channel-
tunnel/) another conspiracy theory is in the making:

> A fire has broken out on a train going through the Channel Tunnel today on
> the anniversary of 911.
>
> Coincidence?
