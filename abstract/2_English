Solzhenitsyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn), the Nobel
Prize-winning author of [_The Gulag
Archipelago_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulag_Archipelago), has died on
Sunday. He was 89.

Reactions to Solzhenitsyn's death are already beginning to appear in the
Russophone blogosphere, and here's [one post on the writer's
legacy](http://markgrigorian.livejournal.com/206956.html) (RUS), by LJ user
_markgrigorian_ :

> **Solzhenitsyn has died**
>
> This kind of news always comes unexpectedly. He was 89 years old.
>
> For me Solzhenitsyn began from the kitchen radio set. Week after week, every
> evening, my grandfather listened to _The Gulag Archipelago_ being read. I
> was listening, too, understanding little of Solzhenitsyn's text, but
> catching episodes that [were so powerful they left one breathless] – due to
> the facts, eyewitness accounts and the sequence of events [presented in
> them].
>
> Of course, I couldn't have known then the already famous story with [[ _One
> Day in the Life of Ivan
> Denisovich_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich)],
> [[ _Novyi Mir_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novy_Mir) literary magazine,
> which first published Solzhenitsyn's story in November 1962], [[Aleksandr
> Tvardovsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Tvardovsky), editor of
> _Novyi Mir_ ]…
>
> For a long time, Solzhenitsyn was mainly and only the author of _The
> Archipelago_ for me.
>
> This feeling grew even stronger when photographer Misha Kalantar spent
> several nights photographing page after page of _The Archipelago_ text,
> printed in Paris, and it was then that I could see – see but not read – a
> fat pile of photo pages of this book.
>
> I read it later. By fits and starts, because you could only borrow the book
> “for one night.” And how much can you manage to read in one night? Even
> though [I'm a fast reader], I was overwhelmed by emotions, had to put the
> book aside, catch my breath, wait before diving into the documentary
> description of the horrible Soviet camps, into the ruthless systematic
> description of the murders and crimes of the System.
>
> Then there was [[ _Cancer
> Ward_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Ward)], and then [[ _The
> First Circle_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Circle)].
>
> I liked the deliberately old-fashioned style and the solidness of his texts,
> the “pre-Soviet” heavy weight of the composition, the leisurely pace of the
> narrative.
>
> Soviet readers used to begin their acquaintance with Solzhenitsyn from _One
> Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_ and _Matryona's Place_ , but for me
> these works supplemented what I'd already read and knew.
>
> His essay on _How to Make Russia Better_ repelled me immediately. I couldn't
> – and still can't – accept that open nationalism that was revealed in that
> little text. Though in 1990, the first phrase – “The clock of communism has
> stopped striking.” – read like a literary, artistic summary of what had
> happened. What had finally happened.
>
> Around the same time, I began to understand that Solzhenitsyn represents the
> nationalistic wing of the Soviet dissident movement. And it somehow became
> clear to me that having to choose between him and [[Andrei
> Sakharov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Sakharov)], who stood for
> democratic values, I've chosen Sakharov's direction.
>
> [[ _The Oak and the Calf_](http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/solz-
> oak.html)] – I read it as an example of uncompromising struggle of an
> individual against the System. Even though there are flaws in this book,
> it's an easy read. Which means it is written well.
>
> [[ _The Red Wheel_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Wheel)] was already
> beyond me.
>
> Solzhenitsyn's [Orthodox Christian/patriotic] direction is something
> completely not mine. [[ _August
> 1914_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_1914)] I perceive as the gradual
> loss of literary taste and writing skills.
>
> But, leaving aside my inner rejection of the philosophy and, at times, the
> [literary style] of Solzhenitsyn, I'd still like to say that his _Gulag
> Archipelago_ was a true feat. In the Soviet conditions, having to fight
> censorship and persecution, despite searches, Solzhenitsyn managed to
> collect the unique material, systematize it and convey it in form that's
> absolutely striking in its clarity.
>
> This should not be underestimated. _The Archipelago_ is a great book.
