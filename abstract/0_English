bloggers found much to analyze in last night's televised debate between United
States presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.

What the US approach to Pakistan should be was a core part of discussion,
since Pakistan has come under greater scrutiny in recent times and is
considered a hot-spot.

In roughly 37 days, the United States of America will be electing its 44th
President. Though the elections are limited only to the US, the outcome of the
election will have a far greater global impact.

Riaz Haq writes on _[Haq's Musings
blog](http://www.riazhaq.com/2008/09/mccain-and-obama-debate-pakistan-
policy.html)_ :

> There is a significant concentration of Muslim vote in Florida and Michigan.
> If, as the anecdotal evidence suggests, Obama gets the lion's share of the
> Muslim American vote, then he could win the presidency by a thin margin of

> Americans?

He summarizes the result of the debate in favor of McCain:

> it is clear that Sen McCain is far more knowledgeable about Pakistan than
> Senator Obama. Mr. McCain has also repeatedly stressed diplomacy and close
> working relationship with Pakistan and demonstrated his commitment by his
> actions such as several visits and phone conversations with Pakistani
> leadership recently and in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Obama has made
> aggressive statements about Pakistan without making serious effort to
> understand the issues faced by Pakistanis in FATA.

_[Pakistan Policy Blog](http://pakistanpolicy.com/2008/09/27/obama-and-mccain-
equally-mediocre-on-pakistan/)_ argues extensively for and against both sides:

> **OBAMA GOOD FOR CIVILIANS, BAD FOR MILITARY** Obama’s support for
> Pakistan’s fledgling democracy and appropriation of the Biden plan, which
> calls for vastly increasing development aid, is excellent. It is an integral
> part of a transition toward a full-fledged Pakistan policy. But Obama seems
> unaware of the clear and present economic danger in Pakistan
>
> **MCCAIN GOOD FOR MILITARY, BAD FOR CIVILIANS** McCain has yet to really
> come to terms with the existence of a civil, democratic government in
> Pakistan. He fails to include Pakistan in his proposed League of
> Democracies. He seems in denial — or his talking points have yet to be
> updated — so much that he is confused as to what the president’s name is.
> “Kardari.” …. it also demonstrates the greatest flaw in McCain’s Pakistan
> policy: he has failed to adapt it to a post-Musharraf Pakistan

Interestingly _[Pakistan Policy
Blog](http://pakistanpolicy.com/2008/09/27/obama-and-mccain-equally-mediocre-
on-pakistan/)_ coins a keyword “McBama” which could potentially be a mash-up
of both policies:

> **MCBAMA GOOD FOR COMPREHENSIVE U.S-PAKISTAN RELATIONS** neither the
> candidates, nor most in the U.S. policy community, truly understands the
> comprehensive failure that is Afghanistan. In respect to a Pakistan policy,
> Obama’s is more promising. McCain offers strengths vis-a-vis relations with
> Pakistan’s military and respect for its sovereignty that Obama fares
> miserably on.

Temporal at _[Baithak](http://baithak.blogspot.com/2008/09/six-short-takes-on-
why-obama-came-out.html)_ shares his frustration at McCain mispronouncing
names:

> John McCain, the “expert” in foreign policy mispronounced Ahmadinejad's name
> four times in a row and screwed up Zardari's name to boot.

On my own blog [Teeth
Maestro](http://www.teeth.com.pk/blog/2008/09/27/president-kirdari-mccain-
obama) I also commented on the mispronunciation puzzle:

> Probably the most interesting surprise was when McCain could not properly
> pronounce the name of our President Mr. Asif Ali Zardari to utter a mumbling
> **Kirdari** (sic), its not a crime by any standard to fumble with a
> difficult pronunciation, but when dealing with foreign dignitaries you try
> your damnedest to ensure that you pronounce their name correctly, lest they
> be offended. If this was just the start then the Iranian would have a field
> day ripping him apart since a few minutes later McCain made minced meat out
> of pronouncing Ahmedinejad’s name to utter something like **Ahmadinenene**
> (sic) – Definitely a diplomatic PR disaster awaiting to happen.

_[Changing up

[Procastination](http://www.zackvision.com/weblog/2008/09/presidential-
debate-1.html)_ summarized his LiveBlogging coverage to say that, “I would
rate it a draw. Obama didn’t land any knockout punches” and later pipes in
with a [CBS
poll](http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/09/26/politics/horserace/entry4482028.shtml)
swinging in favor of Obama to say, “That sounds good for Obama & [CNN
Polling](http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/initial_polls_show_obama_winni.php)
is even better.”

On _[Teeth Maestro](http://www.teeth.com.pk/blog/2008/09/27/president-kirdari-
mccain-obama)_ , my analysis is in favor of an Obama-Biden victory:

> Pakistan stands at a fork, if the same old policies are followed, the same
> blind sighted relationship maintained with crooks and dictators running our
> country the menacing war on terror will only get worse surely something both
> America and Pakistan wish not to happen. Obama on the other hand represents
> a fresh change, as per my neutral review of the debate, it is my
> understanding that if they both support the approximately the same line of
> action for Pakistan, I would carefully put my eggs into Obama’s basket, he
> talks with more commitment to the challenges ahead while simultaneously
> suggesting and a tough guy approach on Pakistan. He wants to solve the issue
> of War on Terror and not let it linger on longer then necessary. With
> Senator Biden as his side who has been the only American bureaucrat to fully
> understand the problem in Pakistan, I feel that an Obama-Biden presidency
> will be a brighter future for Pakistan.
