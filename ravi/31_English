In what might be the first case of a prominent blogger being assaulted and
detained in the South Caucasus, two youth activists were yesterday imprisoned
for two months pre-trial investigative detention in what many consider to be a
travesty of justice.

Denied access to the trial held behind closed doors, one Facebook status line
update reported that the German Human Rights Ombudsperson, coincidentally in
Baku at the time, considered its conduct to be in violation of Azerbaijan's
international commitments.

The evening Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizada were assaulted and later detained by
police, _Global Voices Online_ Azerbaijan author Ali S. Novruzov[ informed
readers of the case](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/08/azerbaijan-
youth-activists-beaten-and-detained/). _Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty
(RFE/RL)_ also [reported on the
incident](http://www.rferl.org/content/Youth_Activists_Arrested_In_Azerbaijan_/1773150.html).

> Emin Milli is known as a critic of the government who is very active in
> social networks like Facebook. Hajizada is one of the founders of the OL
> Youth group, which highlights the social problems of young people with
> popular videos shared on Youtube and social networking sites.

> Human rights activist Leyla Yunus said the way the activists were attacked

Considered by many to be two of the most prominent youth movements, both _OL!_
and the _AN Network_ have been prolific in their use of new media tools such
as blogs, social networking sites and _YouTube_ to [promote non-violence,
modernity, tolerance and democracy in Azerbaijan](http://ol-
az.blogspot.com/2006/06/ol-azerbaijan-youth-movement-manifesto.html).

> We believe that to ensure a healthy future, Azerbaijan needs independently
> thinking, well educated and capable youth. The youth should also carry the
> responsibility for the future of the state and statehood. […] “OL!” Movement
> is a movement of the youth who, regardless of their nationality, language,
> religion and gender, strive for the sustainable and comprehensive
> development of Azerbaijan.

The young activists and their friends had already appeared on the radar screen
with a protest demonstration dispersed by police in May [during which Mili had
also been detained](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/15/azerbaijan-
bloggers-speak-about-baku-youth-protest/) along with several others. Indeed,
on the day of the trial, _RFE/RL_ wondered if it [wasn't some of this
work](http://www.rferl.org/content/Donkey_Satire_In_Azerbaijan/1774005.html)
which attracted the attention of the authorities.

> We wrote yesterday about the arrests of two Azerbaijani youth activists. The
> video above, produced and distributed by the OL and AN youth movements, is
> the type of thing that likely got them into hot water.
>
> The head of OL, Adnan Hajizade, is one of the two arrested.
>
> In the video, members of OL are making fun of the government for its “waste”
> of oil money. After local media reported that Azerbaijan had imported two
> donkeys from abroad each for a price of $41,000, one of the donkeys holds a
> press conference:

Reaction was quick to appear online. Utilizing _Facebook_ and _Twitter_ ,
updates on their detention and later trial appeared on the Internet.

Personal reflections on the incident also appeared on blogs. _Fighting
windmills? Take a pill._ [was particularly
upset](http://fatalin.blogspot.com/2009/07/point-of-no-return.html).

>
> Today everything seems different. Weather is annoying, trees are too green,
> people are meaningless and two close friends of mine are beaten up, detained
> and pressed charges in something so obviously set up.

> Seven hours in front of the police stations, three hours of sleep hugging

> I'm exhausted, worried and angry.  
>  Ask me if I love Baku in summer now.

_Flying Carpets and Broken Pipelines_ was [similarly
distressed](http://flyingcarpetsandbrokenpipelines.blogspot.com/2009/07/what-
great-morning-azeri-youth.html), and especially when sentence was passed down.
The blogger, however, also [notes the effect the case has
had](http://flyingcarpetsandbrokenpipelines.blogspot.com/2009/07/no-
title.html) on many young people in Azerbaijan.

A _Facebook_ page [has been set up in support of Emin Milli and Adnan
Hajizada](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=121457666094). There is also a
petition which can be signed online

_OL!_ has a _YouTube_ channel [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/olmedia).
