Emin Milli, one of two youth and civil society activists [severly
beaten](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/08/azerbaijan-youth-activists-
beaten-and-detained/) and [jailed for two
months](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/11/azerbaijan-youth-activist-
blogger-sentenced-after-trial-behind-closed-doors/) for hooliganism in Baku
last week, [sent a tweet](http://twitter.com/eminmilli/status/2307605415) back
on 24th June. Not only was it the last before his arrest, but it was also
particularly poignant.

Quoted person is Azerbaijan's ex-President [Abulfaz
Elchibey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C3%BClfaz_El%C3%A7ibay) who was
arrested for his dissident activities during Soviet period. The day of Emin's
tweet was Elchibey's 71th anniversary.
