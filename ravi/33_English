As youth activists [face trial in Azerbaijan on charges of
hooliganism](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/08/azerbaijan-youth-
activists-beaten-and-detained/) despite eye witness accounts that they were
instead the victims of assault, concerns are emerging that the way in which
young opponents are targeted is becoming the modus operandi for authoritarian
regimes in the region.

This is particularly true given a similar case in Armenia when several members
of the opposition _Hima!_ ( _Now!_ ) youth movement were injured while handing
out leaflets advertising a political rally at the beginning of July. Reports
say that some of them were pistol whipped by police.

The detention of one for “hooliganism” has led opposition blogs such as _Free
Armenia_ to consider him as the “[youngest political
prisoner](http://andreeatanase.blogspot.com/2009/07/release-tigran-arakelyan-
youngest.html)” in the country.

> Young oppositional activist Tigran Arakelyan was arrested on 5 July 2009 by
> the Armenian Police, based on false charge for hooliganism. On 1 July 2009
> about 15 policemen dressed in civilian attacked with guns about 30 young
> oppositional activists who distributed leaflets, informing upcoming
> opposition rally to be held on 2 July 2009 in Yerevan. 3 of them were
> severally beaten and taken to the hospital Surb Grigor Lusavorich. Now they
> fabricated a criminal case of hooliganism and arrested one of the young
> activists.

_Nazarian_ , another pro-opposition blogger, also [comments on the
case](http://hnazarian.blogspot.com/2009/07/another-political-prisoner.html).
The blog posts a photograph of Arakelyan, noting his diminutive size, and
alleges that those the young activist is accused of assaulting were undercover
agents.

The _Hima!_ blog [reports that Arakelyan has since gone on hunger
strike](http://himaarmenia.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/arrest/) and that the
chairperson of the main political party in the extra-parliamentary opposition
coalition [has joined him in the
action](http://himaarmenia.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/hunger-strike/). Sentence
has not been passed and the activist has been detained for two months pending
final judgement.

A _Facebook_ page has also [been set up in Arakelyan's
support](http://himaarmenia.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/facebook/).
