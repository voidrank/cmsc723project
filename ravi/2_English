India's Health Minister, [Mr. Ghulam Nabi
Azad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Nabi_Azad), has stirred up
controversy and
[angered](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/Angry-gays-demand-
Azads-resignation/articleshow/9116609.cms) the gay community and gay rights
activists with his recent comments at a HIV/AIDS conference in New Delhi. Mr.
Azad was widely quoted in both
[national](http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/ghulam-nabi-azad-calls-
homosexuality-unnatural-and-a-disease-116761) and
[international](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-14024774)
mainstream media as having referred to homosexuality as
[“unnatural”](http://www.firstpost.com/fwire/homosexuality-is-unnatural-says-
ghulam-nabi-azad-36432.html) and a
[“disease”](http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2011/07/05/indian-health-minister-
invents-queer-disease/) that had [come from the
West](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2081402,00.html) and was
unfortunately spreading fast in the country.

The resulting uproar soon forced the Minister to [issue a
clarification](http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/ghulam-nabi-azad-offers-
clarification-on-homophobic-remarks-116985) regarding his controversial
comments. He [blamed the media](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/media-has-
misquoted-me-azad-on-homosexuality/165230-3.html) for misquoting him and
stated that he was referring to HIV as the disease and not passing judgement
on sexual orientation or preference.

Despite Mr. Azad's clarification (which many have not bought into), his
initial controversial comments soon went viral and generated a lot of buzz,
not only within the country but internationally as well. Some went so far as
to [draw comparisons](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/07/05/indian-
health-minister-pulls-an-mbeki/) with the [controversial AIDS-
related](http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-07-04/news/debating-the-obvious/2/)
theory propounded by the former South African President [Thabo
Mbeki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabo_Mbeki) in 2000.

Michel Sidibé, executive director of [UNAIDS](http://www.unaids.org) was
present at the conference where Mr. Azad made his controversial comments.
UNAIDS promptly issued a [press
statement](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2011/july/20110705psmsm/)
announcing their position on the issue of homosexuality and denouncing
homophobia as ‘prejudice’. Saying that the comments were [not in line with the
country's policy](http://www.livemint.com/2011/07/05222859/Michel-Sidibe--
Azad8217s-c.html), Sidibé commented:

> India’s rich tradition of inclusivity and social justice must include men
> who have sex with men and transgender people

The buzz was very much evident online – on Twitter, blogs, forums, Facebook
etc. The reactions were varied, ranging from humor to outright anger and
demands that Azad be sacked.

Both the Health Minister and his alleged [gay
gaffe](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/07/20117515437104974.html)
soon became the butt of jokes on Twitter. Comments were often laced with
sarcasm. Some examples:

However, not everyone was seeing the humor in the Health Minister's comments
and subsequent predicament. Many of the tweeters felt that the comments were
indeed unhealthy, regressive and reeked of ignorance if not outright
prejudice.

Many of the netizens saw these comments as a setback for gay rights and the
country's [fight against
HIV/AIDS](http://omasiali.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/why-are-white-mutants-
albino-devils-promoting-homosexuality/). Gord Barnes, a fieldworker with of
Amnesty International, tweeted:

Not everyone was buying the Health Minister's subsequent clarifications
either. _Wonderman_ [wrote](http://southern4life.blogspot.com/2011/07/indias-
health-minister-ghulam-nabi-azad.html) on his blog:

> A disease? We went from sin, demons and now a disease. However Mr. Azad says
> he was taken out of context…Good luck with the back tracking, Boo Boo.

Canadian blogger _James_ [wrote](http://gay-persons-of-
color.blogspot.com/2011/07/uninformed-indian-health-minister-makes.html) on
his blog:

> Epic ignorance from India’s Health Minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, was displayed

> people-debunked.html) keep his job? Ahh, fiction-based politics.

Many other gay blogs/sites too [appeared
unmoved](http://www.towleroad.com/2011/07/india-health-minister-defends-gay-
disease-comment.html) by Mr. Azad's plea that he had indeed been misquoted and
misunderstood. An [online
petition](http://www.gaylaxymag.com/blog/index.php/2011/07/sign-petition-
against-ghulam-nabi-azads-homophobic-statement/) has been started denouncing
the Minister's comments.

Interestingly, amidst all of this outrage, there is a section of netizens who
are quietly supporting the Minister's comments.

That these tweeters are not alone in their support of the Health Minster, is
evident from this tweet:

> [@ikaveri](http://twitter.com/#%21/ikaveri/status/87890976852557825 "kaveri
> ahuja"): And now I know there are many people on my timeline who agree with
> Ghulam Nabi Azad.

However, others were quick to denounce these homophobic comments as
regressive.

Currently, the debate seems far from over and it remains to be seen what (if
any) damage control exercise will be undertaken by the government to contain/
alleviate this ongoing controversy.
