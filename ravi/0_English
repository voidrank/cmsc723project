Cuban bloggers continue to update their posts about [the most recent
attack](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/18/cuba-female-activists-
reportedly-beatendetained/) on _[Las Damas de
Blanco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_in_White)_ (The Ladies in White),
in which members of the group were reportedly [“attacked and brutally
beaten](http://babalublog.com/2011/07/ladies-in-white-violently-attacked-
yesterday-by-castro-state-security/)…by agents of Castro State Security upon
exiting a church sanctuary.”

The [Coalition of Cuban-American
Women](http://coalitionofcubanamericanwomen.blogspot.com/2011/07/ladies-in-
white-beaten-dragged-and.html) has issued a press release denouncing the
attack, which even includes an[ audio
clip](http://www.martinoticias.com/noticias/Agreden-a-opositoras-en-Santiago-
de-Cuba--125710308.html) [es] of one of the Ladies, Tania Montoya Vázquez,
relating her experience. _[El Cafe
Cubano](http://elcubanocafe.blogspot.com/2011/07/cuba-ladies-in-white-beaten-
dragged.html)_ has republished the Coalition's statement in a show of
solidarity.

_[Babalu](http://babalublog.com/2011/07/attack-on-the-ladies-in-white-a-
desperate-plea-for-help-recorded-during-the-attack/)_ comments on the
“recording by opposition leader Tania Montoya Vazquez, who called in to
_Hablalo Sin Miedo_ while a violent attack against the _Ladies in White_ was
taking place yesterday”, saying:

> You can hear the desperation and fear in her voice. Even if you do not speak
> or understand Spanish, the tone of her voice and the screams in the
> background give a chilling account of the brutality of the Castro
> dictatorship.

The incident has caused an outcry from other factions as well; see The
International Federation of Liberal Youth's statement,
[here](http://iflry.org/blogs/mos/archive/2011/07/18/Condemnation-of-
Cuba_2700_s-Continuing-Crackdown.aspx):

> Belkis Cantillo Ramirez was shot in the arm, while others were brutally
> beaten with batons, stones and other objects. In the midst of the violence,
> Tania Montoya and Rodaisa Corrioso were arrested by the authorities. Aside
> from these two brave women, thirteen members of this organization, including
> Belkis Cantillo Ramirez, are receiving medical care at a local hospital.
>
> The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) condemns these attacks
> in the strongest terms. _Las Damas de Blanco_ is a strictly peaceful
> movement. To respond to such non-violent resistance with such brutal
> repression colours the Castro regime as tyrannical at best. If these attacks
> were not sanctioned by the authorities, then an investigation must be
> immediately initiated and given far-reaching jurisdiction.

The statement goes on to demand that “Tania Montoya and Rodaisa Corrioso must
be immediately and unconditionally released”, while _Babalu_ writes [another
post](http://babalublog.com/2011/07/ladies-in-white-beaten-dragged-and-
stoned/) with “more graphic details” (including photos), saying:

> A quick review this morning of the websites run by some prominent ‘Cuba
> Experts’ finds no mention whatsoever of this brutal and violent attack on
> these defenseless yet courageous women. The narrative put forth by these
> ‘experts’ mirrors the narrative put forth by the Castro regime…they are not
> about to shine the light of truth on the atrocities…

_[Uncommon
Sense](http://marcmasferrer.typepad.com/uncommon_sense/2011/07/castro-thugs-
attack-ladies-in-white-outside-of-church.html)_ also weighs in, making the
point that:

> To its credit, a spokesman for the Catholic Church in Santiago de Cuba
> [confirmed the report](http://www.ddcuba.com/derechos-humanos/5877-fuente-
> de-la-iglesia-confirma-la-paliza-de-el-cobre-contra-dieciseis-damas-de-),
> and denounced the attack.

This has proven to be an interesting observation, considering
_[Babalu](http://babalublog.com/2011/07/usa-todays-purgative-elixir-cardinal-
jaime-ortega-for-president-of-cuba/)_ ‘s take on a _[USA
Today](http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2011-07-18-castro-cuba-
cardinal-ortega_n.htm)_ editorial suggesting that:

> Post-Castro Cuba will need someone trusted by all segments of society to
> help shepherd this nation into a new era, without bloodshed or upheaval.
> Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino, archbishop of Havana, is that man.
> The son of a sugar mill worker, Ortega is uniquely equipped to fill any
> power vacuum.

_Babalu_ [strongly disagrees](http://babalublog.com/2011/07/usa-todays-
purgative-elixir-cardinal-jaime-ortega-for-president-of-cuba/):

> In a colossal display of sheer ignorance and contemptuous arrogance, Pinsky
> nominates for president one of the most corrupted and compromised
> individuals in Cuba today while ignoring venerable leaders such as Dr. Oscar
> Elias Biscet, who unlike Ortega, has not compromised his principles or
> allowed himself to be used as a political tool by the dictatorship.

_[El Cafe Cubano](http://elcubanocafe.blogspot.com/2011/07/looking-other-
way.html)_ supports this view, saying:

> This past Sunday in ‘Santiago de Cuba, a city in the Eastern province of
> Cuba, women pro democracy activists were savagely beaten and verbally
> attacked in the streets by Cuban State Security agents after they attended
> mass in the Basilica of _El Cobre_ , a Catholic shrine dedicated to _Our
> Lady of Charity_ , where they prayed for the freedom of all Cuban political
> prisoners and for the freedom of Cuba.’
>
> The Catholic Church silent and looking the other way…

No doubt, the Cuban diaspora will continue to follow developments and provide
cyber support for _The Ladies in White_.
