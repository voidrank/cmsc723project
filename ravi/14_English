The [tawjihi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawjihi) is the general secondary
examination in Gaza, the West Bank and Jordan, and it determines a student's
choice of university and major. The fact that this year the exams were held
simultaneously in the West Bank and Gaza was hailed as a sign of national
[unity](http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=213487). In this post,
we hear the reaction of bloggers in Gaza to the tawjihi results.

On average only half the students who sit the tawjihi actually
[pass](http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=203837). Tawjihi
results are announced in the media, and public
[celebrations](http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=203837) are
held for those who pass. Each year the highest scorer – this year an honour
held by Tala Al-Battia of Nablus – becomes a
[celebrity](http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=213578). Jawwal,
the Palestinian mobile phone service provider, is the “accredited sponsor” of
the tawjihi exams, and ran a
[competition](http://www.myjawwal.com/personal/personal_current_campaigns_details.php?pid=49&langid=2)
this year called “Guess Your Tawjihi Result and Win Thousands of Dollars”.
However, for the families of teenagers killed in the
[attacks](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2008-gaza-strip-
bombings/) on Gaza earlier this year, this is a time of sadness – and to
commemorate the students, the Hamas government presented
[honorary](http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=213662) tawjihi
certificates.

At the _Electronic Intifada_ , _Rami Almeghari_ reported on the determination
of Gaza's students to study for their exams, regardless of
[circumstances](http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10676.shtml). One
student, Abeer Abu Shawish, told him:

> “Prior to the war in late December 2008, I had a plan for studying for the
> tawjihi. One day, in the middle of the war, I heard shelling nearby at
> 11:00pm. However, I took a long deep breath and continued my studies.
> Although I was extremely upset by the Israeli attacks from air, sea and
> land, I told myself that I must succeed in order to fight the Israeli
> occupation with my own way, education!”

The stress of the exams is clear in a post by student _[Ghost of
Palestine](http://al7oot88.jeeran.com/archive/2009/7/913013.html)_ called “The
results are out”:

لا تعليـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــق.!

No commmmmment!

_Mutasharrid_ has just passed, with a score of
[91.9](http://motshard.blogspot.com/2009/07/919.html):

أمّي ، أبي ، دربكة الأقدام على موسيقى وأغاني لا نحفظها ، أصوات ضحكاتهم
الغجريّة ، زغاريد الفلاحات بكل ما اوتين من فرح ، همهمة جدتي بأدعيتها القدسيّة
، الفرح الوحشيّ …

My mother, my father, the footsteps to music and songs we haven't memorised,
the sounds of their gypsy laughs, the ululations of the farmer women with all
the happiness they can summon, the humming of my grandmother of Jerusalem
prayers, the untamed happiness…

_Hazem_ [says](http://hazemgaza.blogspot.com/2009/07/blog-post_21.html):

أتقدم بالتهنئة الممزوجة بعبير التقدير والاحترام لطلبة الثانوية العامة بمناسبة
نجاحهم سائلاً المولى عز وجل ان يوفقهم فى حياتهم العلمية والعملية .  
ونقول رغم الحصار والدمار رغم الحرب الاخيرة على غزة الا ان النسب مبشرة والنتائج
افضل من نتائج العام الماضى

I would like to extend my congratulations, along with my appreciation and
respect, to the secondary level students on the occasion of their success,
asking the Almighty that they succeed in their future studies and work. We can
say that despite the siege and destruction, despite the last war on Gaza, the
pass rates are positive and the results better than those of the previous
year.

هذه بعض مشاهد فرحة فلسطين بطلابها المتفوقين، فلسطين المعروفة بتحصيل أبنائها
الأكاديمي العالي مقارنة بأقرانها من العرب، الذين عرفوا أن علماً يحصلونه هنا
وهناك يُعلي رصيد نضالهم. حتى الطلاب الأسرى منهم (1821 أسير) ما زالوا حتى
اللحظة يطالبون سلطات الاحتلال بحقهم في التقدم لامتحان الثانوية من وراء
القضبان. مشاهد هنا وهناك، بعضها يعكس مشاعر ممتزجة في قلوب الفلسطينيين مزينة
بأمل أن تتحول الوحدة التربوية إلى وحدةٍ سياسيةٍ .

These are some of the scenes of joy in Palestine for its outstanding students.
Palestine is renowned for the high academic achievement of its students,
compared with other Arab nations. They know that the knowledge they acquire
from every place is part of their resistance. Even the students who are
prisoners (1,821) are continuing to this moment to demand from the occupation
forces [Israel] their right to sit the secondary level examinations from
behind bars. Scenes from here and there, some reflecting the feelings moving
in the hearts of Palestinians, carrying the hope that this educational unity
will turn into political unity.
