Twitter has been accused of attempting to silence tributes to Gaza one-year
after an Israeli onslaught devastated the Palestinian enclave.

Pro-Palestinian and human rights activists used the influential Twitter portal
to mark the one-year anniversary of the Gaza War, and express support for the
besieged territory.

Tweets using the hashtag #Gaza flooded in on December 27th, peaking at number
3 on Twitter's top ten Trending Topics list.

However, complaints emerged of users being briefly blocked from tweeting
#Gaza, with the trend being forced downwards and off the Trending Topics.

In an extensive analysis, Lebanese blogger, [_Nadine
Moawad_](http://www.nadinemoawad.com/2009/12/how-we-trended-gaza-on-twitter/),
accused Twitter of preventing #Gaza from trending:

> People were logging in and feeling so energized to see Gaza trending
> already, so they boosted with great tweets. I was so sure we were going to
> hit number one any second. And then came Hayley.
>
> Who Hayley is I don’t know and I don’t care to google. It was her birthday
> today, so suddenly (and very illogically), HappyBdayHayley shot to number 1.
> It didn’t make any sense!
>
> What made it even weirder is that @zalface discovered many spam bots like
> this one:[@carolmeatsix](http://twitter.com/carolmeatsix) that were spamming
> twitter with #HappyBdayHayley for hours at very high rates. How come they

> The only sense we could make was that twitter didn’t want #Gaza to trend.

Did Twitter really hinder tributes to Gaza?

Comments on _[Nadine Moawad’](http://www.nadinemoawad.com/2009/12/how-we-
trended-gaza-on-twitter/)s _post offered varied explanations.

One comment by _[Jillian C. York](http://jilliancyork.com/) _argued that it
was not necessarily Twitter that obstructed #Gaza tweets, but pro-Zionist
online activists competing with pro-Palestinian Twitterers by reporting #Gaza
tweets as spam:

> As for those who got blocked for short periods: It seems that it was not
> Twitter automatically doing it, rather, if a certain number of people
> reports someone as spam (which could be done nefariously – as in prodded by
> the @JIDF or someone else, or because they actually see it as spam (e.g.
> lots of @s in a tweet), Twitter will auto-block then review the account. It
> happened to people who were “tweeting for Shalit” too, so I don’t think we
> can say it was biased, necessarily.

Another comment by _Toufoul_ gave a more technical explanation of the bizarre
events that unfolded on Twitter:

> One thing that might explain the discrepancy between Trendistic and Trending
> Topics in Twitter is the different algorithms they use. Twitter’s Trending
> Topics is not only based on the number of tweets, but also the number of
> tweepers. It is also more difficult for topics that are trendy all the time
> to climb up the list (Twitter is, after all, about what is hot RIGHT NOW!).
> If you look at the longer term graph, you will see that Gaza has been
> consistently trendier than Bailey, Hayley or whatever her name is. It is
> self-defeating in a way.

Discussion of the unusual demotion of the #Gaza trend also ensued on Twitter
itself:

Whether Twitter was deliberately behind the manipulation of the tributes to
Gaza is unclear, but the bizarre trending of #Gaza has left many confused and
pondering.
