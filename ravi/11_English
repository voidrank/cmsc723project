The [Lawyers’ Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyers' data-
versionurl=) in Pakistan, which started in 2007, enjoyed great public support
and
[confidence](http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\\09\\02\\story_2-9-2007_pg7_10)
throughout. The protests of Lawyers to uphold justice and human rights were an
inspiration to the civil society, human rights activists, media and students.
However the recent news of some lawyers harassing members of civil society,
journalists and the police has raised a lot of eyebrows.

> The events that have happened over the past few weeks need no explanation.
> Every child in this beloved country of ours has witnessed the lawyers

[Jazba Blog](http://jazba.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/five-lawyers-beat-an-
assistant-sub-inspector-outside-court/) reports on the incident of Five
lawyers beating an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of police for allegedly
conducting an inquiry against their client.

On 6th of August, after the hearing of a suo motu case pertaining to the
attack on the ASI, some lawyers led by Lahore Bar Association vice-president
M.R. Awan [attacked and manhandled reporters and
cameramen](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-hearing-case-against-manhandling-lawyers-
adjourned-qs-05) on the premises of the Lahore High Court. [The following
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suV9S-gXRWk) was released in YouTube by
_GEO TV_ showing the lawyers’ attack on policemen and journalists.

_Rana Tanveer_ at _Lahore Nama_ informs of a similar incidents in a post
titled “[Lawyers go unbridled, breaking rules in
routine](http://lahorenama.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/lawyers-go-unbridled-
breaking-rules-in-routine/)“:

> Last year in April, lawyers beat former federal minister Dr. Sher Afgan

_Faisal Kapadia_ on Deadpan thoughts criticizes the incidents in a post titled
“[Lawyers gone wild](http://deadpanthoughts.com/2009/08/lawyers-gone-wild/)“:

> It seems that the lawyers movement has now committed suicide by falling on
> its own saber. Where lawyers who are supposed to guarantee the law
> effectively beat up police and press. Where they now seem to think of
> themselves as some form of terminators roaming the street dispensing
> vigilante justice according to their own blinkered vision, there can be no
> hope for this institution.

_Mahir Sheikh Nisar_ at _Pakistan First_ demands immediate action suggesting
that the “[Cheif Justice of Pakistan Lahore High Court should
resign](http://pak1stanfirst.com/home/45-letter-to-editor/1583-chief-justice-
of-pakistan-lahore-high-court-should-resign.html)“:

> The people of Pakistan and its lawyers must wake up to these ill practices
> within the judiciary before the common man loses complete confidence in the
> legal system. The judiciary is dangerously becoming an alter ego to popular
> opinion and political stances rather than maintaining its impartiality.

_Adnan Farooqui_ puts [things in
perspective](http://www.pakspectator.com/somethings-amiss/) claiming why the
media do not call for those policemen to be dismissed from their duties who
manhandled the Chief Justice during the Lawyers movement.

He [concludes]() with some questions:

> Has that same group of people returned to now tarnish the popular image of
> lawyers in front of the country? Or is it really that the lawyers are now
> considering themselves above the law?
