A new Israeli-Palestinian Internet start-up called _G.ho.st_ is taking on
[_Microsoft_](http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=9941863B-1A64-67EA-E472ABAAEF278EF6)
and [_Google_](http://crystalsphere1.blogspot.com/2009/07/get-off-of-my-
cloud.html) in the competition to develop a “[cloud
computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)” operating system
that allows people to access all their files and software via the internet.

[_G.ho.st_](http://g.ho.st/main.jsp)[ ](http://g.ho.st/main.jsp)launched on
July 13 and is offering users 15GB of free disk-space as well as various other
applications to edit documents, presentations and spreadsheets. The system
enables a user to manage email, photos, videos, bookmarks and the option via
[any computer or mobile device](http://www.paggu.com/website-reviews/consumer-
web/ghost-cloud-computing-online-storage-virtual-computer-and-web-os/) that
has Internet access. The operating system is currently available in 20
languages, including Hebrew and Arabic. _G.hos.t_
[welcomes](http://www.g.ho.st/home/TranslateGhost.jsp) improvements to the
translations as well as any new language contributions, making it accessible
to as many people as possible.

Here's an explanatory video, explaining why the system was developed:

And it’s the operating system’s slogan, “No walls”, that has really created a
stir and excitement. _G.ho.st_ not only overcomes technological ‘walls’ or
barriers by making data something that is no longer bound by a device, but it
also overcomes [political walls of
separation](http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-
africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14098321).

The virtual operating system is the result of a rare collaboration between
Israeli and Palestinian developer teams on both sides of the infamous West
Bank separation wall. _G.ho.st_ was founded in 2006 by Zvi Schreiber, an
Israeli businessman, and the chief engineer, Elias Khalil, is Palestinian.

Their teams have never visited each other's offices because often Palestinians
cannot get the permits needed to enter Israel. And Israelis aren't allowed to
travel to certain areas of the West Bank. Most communication between the teams
takes place via video conferencing. As the [_G.ho.st_
website](http://www.g.ho.st/home/GhostInc.jsp)[
](http://www.g.ho.st/home/GhostInc.jsp)explains:

> Ghosts go through walls and the very first wall that _G.ho.st_ goes through
> is the 425 mile wall and fence that Israel is building in the West Bank
> between itself and the Palestinians and which physically divides the
> _G.ho.st_ team into two. However the Internet and positive collaboration
> between human beings transcends all physical boundaries.

So far, most reactions to the operating system have been positive. Here are
some of the comments appearing on _Twitter:_

There also seems to be some interest in future use and development of the
operating system:

Regardless of how this operating system develops, or whether or not it is a
success, _G.ho.st_ is a nice indicator that collaboration across conflict
lines is possible when people embrace a world with no walls.
