The recent detention of two cyber-activists and youth leaders in Azerbaijan
this past week has caused consternation among bloggers and activists inside
and outside Azerbaijan, and now a video campaign has been set off to call the
Azeri government into action to release both youth movement leaders: [Adnan
Hajizada](http://videopetition.blogspot.com/2009/07/adnans-bio.html) and [Emin
Milli.](http://videopetition.blogspot.com/2009/07/emins-bio.html)

Previous Global Voices posts have been updating information: from the [July
8th detention on charges of
hooliganism](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/08/azerbaijan-youth-

detention and arrest](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/13/azerbaijan-

alleged events is being offered at the [Support Azerbaijani Youth Activists’
page](http://videopetition.blogspot.com/) where people can submit their
support videos:
