Although most activity can be found on _Facebook_ where users continue to
update each other on the case of video blogger Adnan Hajizade and youth
activist Emin Milli, [detained last week and sentenced to two months pre-trial
detention](https://globalvoicesonline.org/found/?cof=FORID:9&q=azerbaijan+adnan+emin&btnG=Search+»&cx=000932313665553177304:dg67ra11mvs),
less activity might be visible in the mainstream media, but the situation is
changing. Nevertheless, citizen media remains the main source of information.

In a [personal post from the
heart](http://fatalin.blogspot.com/2009/07/welcome-to-world-kid.html),
_Fighting windmills? Take a pill._ remembers her friends now sitting in prison
on what most consider to be a politically-motivated charges.

Humay, another friend of Hajizade, also posted a personal note on her
_Facebook_ page to mark his birthday.

Meanwhile, _Media Helping Media_ , a non-profit organization which assists
journalists and activists in countries such as Azerbaijan, says that blogs and
Twitter were [crucial in getting word out of Hajizade and Milli's
arrest](http://www.mediahelpingmedia.org/content/view/444/1/) long before the
traditional media did.

> It took the traditional news wires at least 24 hours to catch up with the
> coverage of the arrest of two youth movement leaders in Azerbaijan. By that
> time dozens of blogs had been updated and probably thousands of tweets sent.
> The news was everywhere; everywhere except on the mainstream media. When the
> news wires arrived they were reminders of yesterday's news. Probably not too
> late for the media that feeds off and reproduces the wires, but too late for
> those who want news as it happens.

> That was all going on during Friday and Saturday. I couldn't find a word
> about the story on traditional mainstream media.
>
> Almost 24 hours later the wires caught up. First AFP filed a piece ‘Bloggers
> held on hooliganism charges in Azerbaijan: rights group’ and then Reuters
> ‘Azeri blogger detained, oil major presses case’.
>
> Granted, Reuters added an interesting new angle; that BP, who employed one
> of the arrested men, was pushing for his release.
>
> Both good pieces again re-tweeted and spread virally and quickly, but
> 24-hours behind.

> Glad I didn't wait for the wires or traditional, mainstream media to catch
> up. If I had, 24 hours would have been lost and I would have been reading
> yesterday's news.
