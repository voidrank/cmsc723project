Part of the backlash against [Bermudian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda)
[Premier Ewart Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewart_Brown)‘s [decision to
accept four former Guantanamo
detainees](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/12/bermuda-usa-guantanamo-
controversy/) into the island has been [the opposition
party](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/bermuda-guantanamo-farce/)‘s [tabling of
a “No Confidence” vote against him in
Parliament](http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d966a73003003f&sectionId=60)
– a motion that bloggers are reporting has been defeated.

_[Vexed Bermoothes](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/motion-being-debated/)_ was
following the parliamentary proceedings closely:

> They have started debating the motion of no confidence in Dr. Brown.
>
> The Speaker tried to change the motion to: “That this house has no
> confidence in the Government and deplores the actions of the Premier in
> relation to the Uighurs matter” or something like that.
>
> It finally ended up as “That this honourable house has no confidence in the
> Government led by the Premier” after the UBP resisted.
>
> Dr. Brown has corrected his earlier statements regarding the Uighur risk
> assessment, saying that he erred rather than knowingly mislead in his
> statement to the House and subsequent radio broadcasts. Sayeth he “To err is
> human, to forgive divine.”
>
> Please give me some novocaine!

As he awaited the results of the debate, [the blogger
noted](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/not-business-as-usual/):

> If Dr. Brown survives this upheaval and there is no change to the political
> status quo, let me promise you that it will not be business as usual on
> Monday. It will have been proven that there is no consequence to violating
> the Bermuda Constitution. From a political risk perspective, that makes us
> an unstable country.
>
> It is important for countries to have a reliable Rule of Law. But there are
> weaknesses in laws even, because laws are made by politicians. And that’s
> why the Constitution is so important. It must be passed by public
> referendum. All politicians and laws must toe to the Constitution.
>
> Ergo, a politician who flaunts the Constitution is effectively saying ‘I am
> beholden to no law’.

As news broke that [the motion had been defeated following a 14-hour
debate](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/motion-defeated/),
_[Breezeblog](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/motion-defeated/)_
commented:

> I’m disappointed and depressed but not surprised at the spinelessness of
> those who blindly follow Dr. Brown. Maybe there’ll be a leadershp challenge
> at the PLP conference in the Fall but I doubt it. I suspect Dr. Brown will
> emerge stronger than ever from this.
>
> The UBP, though, are finished as a credible Opposition.

_Vexed Bermoothes_ , meanwhile, [called the result “a catastrophe for
Bermuda”](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/liecheatsteal/):

> The motion in the House of Assembly failed by 22-11 (two UBP MPs failing to
> vote).
>
> I have lost all faith in our political system. I think we are governed by
> crooks and fools for their own benefit.
>
> We have retained a leader who during the debates yesterday free admitted
> that he violated the law and the Constitution, and kept his own Government
> in the dark as to his actions and motives. Half the debate was about race
> and independence, rather than the simple task of reprimanding a leader who
> apparently will not comply with the law, nor represent the people.
>
> I am ashamed for Bermuda. The consequences for this will be terrible for our
> community.

_[21 Square](http://www.21square.com/2009/06/act-of-god.html)_ has not been
able to get over the Premier's defense of his actions by calling them “an act
of God”:

> An act of God? This is the same kind of thing terrorists say before blowing
> up buildings full of innocent people.

…while _[Breezeblog](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/the-united-
states-of-bermuda/)_ seemed more interested in Dr. Brown's next move:

> So what will an emboldened and empowered Dr. Brown do next?
>
> Independence is the big fear for many people but maybe there’s another
> option up his sleeve. I’m not normally in the business of publishing rumours
> but I have now heard this one from credible non-UBP sources so I’ll put it
> up here and see who salutes. I’m genuinely interested to hear what people
> think, not stir up anything.
>
> I understand that the PLP has been exploring the option of Bermuda becoming
> a US territory like Puerto Rico as an alternative to independence from
> Britain.
>
> But if – and I stress ‘if’ – it is true, it might explain many of the
> unashamedly pro-American Dr. Brown’s recent actions…

According to
_[Breezeblog](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/bermudians-signing-uk-
petition/)_ , the U.K. is still very much a part of this political debacle:

> [A petition has been
> posted](http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/EwartBrownResign/) on the UK Prime
> Minister’s web site calling for the resignation of Dr. Ewart Brown.
>
> UPDATE: Organisers of the recent local protests are urging people not to
> sign this petition. In an e-mail circulated June 20, they state:
>
> RE: Advise that you do NOT sign the UK petition calling for Ewart Brown’s
> resignation
>
> Advise that you do NOT sign the UK petition calling for Ewart Brown’s
> resignation
>
> Avoid ‘knee jerk’ reactions. We should not throw a petition out to the
> public in haste. As we know, wording is critical. We have to get it right
> and take the time to get it right.

Finally, _[Catch a fire](http://jonnystar.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/the-day-
after/)_ weighed in after “a long night”:

> After reading over the transcripts of the debate and looking at the end
> vote, I think one thing is definitely clear. Dr. Brown won the battle, but
> he has lost the war.
>
> While on the surface it may appear that Dr. Brown’s hand has been
> strengthened, from my reading any such strength now is more illussionary
> that real. The Party, at least in the form of its MPs, have clearly
> expressed that business as usual a la Dr. Brown cannot continue. He must now
> either build bridges or accept it is time to go gracefully as per internal
> Party procedures.
>
> The demonstrators will feel disillussioned after these events. That is
> unfortunate, and I advise them to carry on their energy of political and
> community activism in other areas. There are a lot of issues of concern in
> our society, and if people can mobilise as they did last week, there is no
> reason why this momentum cannot be carried forward for the betterment of our
> people on other issues.
>
> While those in power may cry that control is being lost, in fact it is our
> democracy and political consciousness that is being strengthened.
