The Philippines is in a state of national mourning after [Corazon
Aquino](http://coryaquino.ph/), who became the country's president after
leading the fight to topple the Marcos dictatorship, died at 3:18 am of
Saturday, Aug. 1, from cardiorespiratory arrest. She was 76.

The murder of her husband oppositionist former Sen. Benigno S. Aquino Jr.
widowed her in 1983.

By 1985 she gave in to the growing clamor that she fight Ferdinand Marcos in a
“snap election”. Weeks after the fraudulent elections, a popular uprising now
known as People Power booted out Marcos and installed Aquino as president.
Aquino thus became the first woman president of the Philippines and the first
female head of state in Asia.

obituary](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/world/asia/01aquino.html?_r=1).

TV and radio networks carried live the Aquino family's announcement of her
passing made in the wee hours of the morning on Saturday, and immediately
started blow-by-blow coverage of the events after her death, taking the
reactions from prominent Filipinos, showing old speeches and interviews of
Aquino, and played songs and hymns that were part of the soundtrack of the
movement to oust the Marcos dictatorship.

President Arroyo declared 10 days of national mourning in honor of Aquino. The
former president had been critical of Arroyo and had twice called on Arroyo to
resign from the presidency.

hails-Aquino-for-unwavering-faith) Benedict XVI, paused and likewise paid
their respects to Aquino as the Philippines’ icon of democracy and for her
“unwavering faith”.

Even as the mainstream media devoted time for the Aquino death coverage, most
of the views come from powerful Filipinos. Ordinary Filipinos, mostly from the
middle class, used the web, especially blogs, microblogs and social networking
sites, to give tribute to Aquino.

“Its [a sad morning](http://inghinyero.com/blog/cory-aquino-dies-at-76/) for
the Philippines,” wrote _Inghinyero.com_ , echoing sentiments of most
Filipinos who woke up Saturday to news that Aquino had died.

In less than three hours since news broke, “Corazon Aquino” and “Cory Aquino”
became [trending
topics](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%22Corazon%20Aquino%22%20OR%20%22Cory%20Aquino%22)
on Twitter as Filipinos expressed their sadness and mourning online.

livestreaming of Aquino videos as the nation mourned and took note of yellow
ribbons on avatars of Filipino Twitter users. Yellow was Aquino's campaign
color in 1986 when she ran against the dictator Marcos.

The blog _Vindication of a Fool_ [stated](http://i-am-
alexisjay.blogspot.com/2009/07/corazon-c-aquino-1933-2009.html) that

> in the next few days, we shall be hearing a lot of tributes for the late
> president. She deserves every bit of them. The nation has lost a moral
> compass and servant leader.

_@cocoy_ [agreed](http://cocoy.tumblr.com/post/153362298/remembering-yellow-
remembering-cory):

> The words, “a grateful nation thanks you for your service,” seem hollow when

> our nation.

In a tribute to her “quiet dignity” even as she faced cancer, _Far From
Neutral_ republished Aquino's [“Prayer for a Happy
Death”](http://farfromneutral.com/exodus/cory-aquinos-prayer-for-a-happy-
death/) which came out at about the time she entered the hospital.

_EdericEder.com_ [wrote](http://www.edericeder.com/mga-pamana-ni-pangulong-
cory-aquino/) in Filipino:

> Sa paglisan ni Pangulong Cory, pag-ibig, pananampalataya, at pag-asa ang
> iniiwan niya sa atin.
>
> Sa pagpanaw ng simbolo ng demokrasya, muling napupukaw ang mga alaala ng
> isang maningning na yugto ng ating kasaysayan nang tayo’y nagkaisang bawiin
> ang ating kalayaan at maghangad ng bagong Pilipinas.

With President Cory's death, she gives love, faith and hope to us.
