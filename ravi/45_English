_“Brown Protest”, photo by[Max Kehrli](http://www.maxkehrli.com/)._

As [Bermudians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda) [continue to react –
unfavourably for the most
part](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/16/bermuda-usa-uk-fallout-over-
guantanamo/) – to [their government's acceptance of former Guantanamo Bay
detainees as full citizens of the tiny
island](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/12/bermuda-usa-guantanamo-
controversy/), bloggers comment on [yesterday's
protest](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/brown-faces-wrath-of-the-
people/) and what [the public
outcry](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/protest-pic-of-the-day/)
could mean for [the nation's
Premier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewart_Brown).

_[The Devil Island](http://www.thedevilisland.com/2009/06/17/about-the-
protest/)_ , known for being a cartoon blog, says:

> Didn’t have anything written, but I wanted to doodle SO bad. There’s tonnes
> of blogs talking about it. I’ve spent the afternoon and evening bitching
> about it and talking about it and reading about it. I’m going to wait for
> the next step.
>
> I HOPE that he [the Premier] doesn’t wriggle out of this, but I’m not
> holding my breath. I can’t find it in myself to put anything past him. One
> of his “supporters” actually compared this to Dr. King. Sickening.
>
> I WOULD however like to welcome these Uighur gentlemen to my home. If the
> vetting turns out copacetic and you guys are cool, we’re cool.

_[Breezeblog](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/take-that-mr-premier/)_
actually posts a video of the protest, which features “the moment Janice
Battersbee told Premier Dr. Ewart Brown what many Bermudians think of him.”
While the [racial divide in the island's
politics](http://cgibbons.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/more-protest-footage/) was
evident, the blogger writes:

> It took great courage as a PLP supporter to stand in front of her country’s
> leader and deliver that – and credit to Brown, he stood there and took it
> with dignity, even if he must have been seething and humiliated inside.
>
> There’s been a lot of internet and radio chatter about how the crowd was
> overwhelmingly and depressingly white – no surprise there – and sadly Hott
> 107 almost seemed to dismiss the protest because of the racial imbalance.
> But the pro-Brown support was noticeable by its absence.
>
> It was encouraging to see Bermudians willing to stand up and be counted and
> as such it was a good day for democracy. The people told their elected
> Premier in no uncertain terms what they thought of him without fear of
> arrest or police brutality. If nothing else, it will have impressed the four
> Uighurs who can only dream of such freedoms back home.

_[Catch a fire](http://jonnystar.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/demos-counter-
demos/)_ takes notice of “a counter-demonstration” that was carded for the
same time of the original protest action:

> This demonstration is being billed as supporting the decision to bring the
> Uighurs here.
>
> This blog takes the position that it encourages active and critical
> participation in Bermuda’s politics, and to that degree I hope that there is
> a good turn-out for today’s demonstrations, as such activity is to the
> credit of our democracy.
>
> This blog is, without hesitation, in the support of those who are critical
> of how this decision was made. I feel that the decision was made not on
> humanitarian grounds and that describing it as such is a red herring and
> emotionally manipulative deflection. I believe that the way this was done
> was contrary to the Constitution, and unnecessarily so.
>
> Now that the Uighurs are here they should stay, but the way the decision was
> done needs protested. Either way, everyone have fun, be careful, confront
> ignorance and generally exercise your democratic rights, either for or
> against the decision.

Meanwhile, the Premier's [reaction to the
protest](http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wxxi/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1518635/World/Bermuda.protesters.denounce.Guantanamo.decision)
does not sit well with _[Vexed
Bermoothes](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/risky-business/)_ :

> Don’t expect much from Dr. Brown. His comment on the protest: ‘As some of
> you might know, I grew up in the protest era. This is nothing new to me. I
> have seen them larger and longer.’ Be careful what you ask for Dr. Brown.
>
> Know we know why the Sally Bassett statue was placed in front of the Cabinet
> building: so the Premier can stand in front of it whenever he is in hot
> water to try and shift the dialogue to one of racial martyrdom. Nice try.

_[Vexed Bermoothes](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/homeless-inaction/)_ is
also focused on the irony of the entire deal…

> On the day that the PLP seeks to wrap itself in laurels of humanitarianism,
> their Government admits that [there are still no funds to replace the
> decrepit and wholly inadequate homeless
> shelter](http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d9682f30030002&sectionId=60)
> in Bermuda.
>
> I encourage all those international groups who are puffing up Dr. Brown for
> solving their problem, to feel free to encourage and assist the Bermuda
> Government in finally fulfilling its obligations to its own people.

…not to mention the [safety issue](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/risky-
business/):

> Premier Ewart Brown
> [stated](http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d9684e30030001&sectionId=60)
> in the House of Assembly on Friday that Police Commissioner Jackson had done
> a thorough security check on the Uighurs.
>
> Well, maybe not. As it turns out – like everyone else in Bermuda, the Police
> only learned about the uighurs on the radio news on Thursday morning.
>
> Is it not a crime to ‘bend the truth’ in a statement to the House of
> Assembly?
>
> The crowds at Parliament at lunch today – which spilled onto the surrounding
> streets – were noisy and fed up particularly compared to the meagre team of
> Brown supporters that gathered in his stage-managed appearance. It will be
> untenable for the PLP to retain support for the Premier in the face of such
> public displeasure. The constant circus surrounding him has become a
> debilitating distraction for Bermuda.

This leads the blogger [to turn his
attention](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/speaker-impartiality/) to [the
opposition party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Bermuda_Party)‘s call
for a vote of “No Confidence” in Premier Brown:

> Typically a motion such as this would be voted upon two weeks after being
> tabled. Understandably, the Premier’s team are pursuing all options to keep
> that from happening.
>
> It is clear that there is considerable public discontent regarding the
> leadership of Dr. Ewart Brown. The Speaker (although currently drawn from
> the PLP ranks) has a strong responsibility to be impartial in conducting the
> affairs of the House. He must facilitate the debate of this motion as soon
> as possible, so that Bermuda can clear the air and get our Government back
> to work.

Finally, he has [a few words of wisdom](http://www.vexedbermoothes.com/time-
to-go-ewart-brown/) for “international groups like Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch [that] are freely tossing around humanitarian plaudits
driven by their deep concerns about Guantanamo Bay and everything that it
represents”:

> They are incorrect if they assume that the backlash towards Dr. Brown is
> based on the Uighurs alone. It is not. The backlash is based on the
> accumulation of ‘unethical but not necessarily illegal’ acts under his
> tenure. If there is no respect amongst our top leadership for the
> Constitution, then there is no Rule of Law. And if there is no consistent
> rule of law, then there are degrading and unreliable human rights for
> Bermudians.
>
> In short, it is fundamentally wrong to undermine the Bermudian Constitution
> so that the American Constitution can retain its lustre.
