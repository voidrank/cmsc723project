The bloggers are trying to understand what is happening in the country and how
adequate is the public administration in Kazakhstan.

[Megakhuimyak thinks](http://megakhuimyak.livejournal.com/642249.html) over
the future of the local political elite by tracing the trends in the their
education [ru]:

> In the beginning of the 20th century and in the end of the 1970s, the elite
> of Kazakhstan studied in Russia, particularly in Moscow. Then, in the early
> 1990s, youngsters studied in Turkey. Starting from 1998, it became popular
> to study in Europe or the US. I expect that in 5-10 years only Harvard and
> other Western universities’ graduates will be in the top league of the
> officials in Kazakhstan, which eventually will have its effect later on.

[Thousand-pa looks back](http://thousand-pa.livejournal.com/380930.html) and
notices [ru]:

> After 19 years of the rule of president Nazarbayev, it can be concluded that
> he was quite successful in establishing the class of large capitalists. The
> situation with middle class is far more complicated. As for poverty, it
> still exists as it did 19 years ago. In the big cities the poverty level has
> decreased, but in the smaller towns and rural areas it, probably, has grown
> even more than it used to be [at the dawn of independence].

[Sadenova is surprised](http://sadenova.livejournal.com/25654.html) that the
governmental system is still stable despite its poor-quality administration
bureaucracy [ru]:

> Our country is so amazing. It is a country of non-professionals. Wherever
> you go you find terrifying “human resources”. Such country technically is
> supposed to fail, but it doesn’t for some reason…
>
> [While the world economists warn that the second phase of crisis is possibly
> coming] the officials in Kazakhstan are already discussing post-crisis
> “innovative development”. Most likely, in Kazakhstan even the crisis has
> specific national features! But a friend of mine roughly explains what does
> this optimism come from: “The oil price has grown up a little, and these
> people felt more relaxed, loosened their ties and had a shot of whiskey”.
