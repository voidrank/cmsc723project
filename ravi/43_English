When we arrived on the lawn, there was a crowd of hundreds of people, mostly
students , running while the bomb squad moved forward firing concussion
grenades (falsely called “moral-effect bombs” because they release splinters
and hurt a lot) and tear gas. The crowd ran up to the history/geography
building, where the assembly had been halted and then bombs began being pelted
in the carpark and entrance of the building (more or less in front of the cafe
and the entrance ramp). We felt a strong smell of tear gas and dozens of our
colleagues began to feel poorly due to the effects of gas – I remember
professors Graziela, Thomas, Alessandro Soares, Cogiolla, Jorge Machado and
Lizete all with swollen and red eyes and feeling dizzy because of the effect
of the gas. The crowd of about 400 or 500 people trapped in this building was
surrounded by police and 4 helicopters. The atmosphere was of panic. For about
an hour, at least, we heard bombs exploding and felt the smell of gas invade
the building.

demonstration in the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil's largest
university, which [ended in a violent confrontation with
Police](http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=18203) on Tuesday, June
9th. Many demonstrators were hurt, some jailed. Another professor, _[Marcos

This is the way that the police and the dean “talk”.  
During an attempt to talk with the commander of the riot police, the
unpreparedness, poor training and authoritarianism led the police officers to
attack me with pepper gas, for nothing, in a violent and needless fashion.
They also hit my wife, Solange Francisco, an employee. When I was speaking
with the commander, Col. Longo assaulted me and when I identified myself as a
professor at USP, I was threatened with “arrest” with the same arrogance that
I had only seen in Col. Erasmus’ days during the invasion of the PUC
[university] in 1977, when I was still a high school student. The commanders
of the PM were too unprepared. Then with the teachers Lisete Arelaro, Chico
Miraglia and others, we tried to talk again to avoid confrontation, but their
response was to fire tear gas.  
The same unpreparedness, poor training and authoritarianism of dean Suely
Vilela was shown through her incompetence in managing [these] conflicts at the
USP.

The video below, edited by an independent group of students, shows the
peaceful beginning and ugly end of Tuesday 9th of June:

community-teargassed-in-brazil-&catid=34:struggles&Itemid=53) [pt] explains
the background of the situation in a letter signed by a group of professors
seeking the support of the international scientific and academic community:

> Conflicts started after a one month strike of university workers whose
> employment status is being disputed due to a legal controversy over
> university autonomy to hire its workers without approval of state

> started a strike on May 5 demanding the preservation of their jobs and other
> labor demands. On May 27, workers started to block the entrance of four
> university buildings because, according to them, university management was
> threatening workers who were using their legal right to strike. On June 1,
> administration called the military police to intervene. On June 4 professors
> joined the strike protesting police occupation of campus. on June 5,
> professors had a two hours meeting with management asking for a non-military
> solution to the labor conflict. However, common sense did not prevail and
> military police attacked a peaceful demonstration of students and workers

> meeting was interrupted by news of a police attack. A few minutes later
> teargas and concussion bombs exploded inside the building. Several of our

On that Tuesday, the riot police came into confrontation with students, staff
and teachers during a demonstration whose goal was exactly the removal of the
police currently on the campus. The event has been well documented and [many
accounts can be found
online](http://www.gpopai.org/greve2009/index.php?title=P%C3%A1gina_principal).
_[Roque](http://passapalavra.info/?p=5786)_ [pt], a USP student, records his
personal account and recalls the history of repression that the USP used often
to see:

> Segundo informações do Sindicato dos Trabalhadores da USP, o Sintusp, a
> última vez em que houve uma intervenção policial no campus da Cidade
> Universitária foi em 1979, há exatamente 30 anos atrás, nos tenebrosos
> tempos da ditadura militar, e contando com um efetivo de 10 ou 15 policiais
> desarmados.

According to the USP Workers’ Union, the Sintusp, the last time that there
were police in the University City was in 1979, it was exactly 30 years ago,
in the darkest days of military dictatorship, and then with a team of 10 or 15
unarmed police.

Thirty years ago, the USP community had taken to the streets to chant the
slogan “down with dictatorship” for the first time. Three decades later, the
police are back on the main campus of USP because dean Suely Vilela supposedly
asked the courts to reclaim possession of buildings that had been occupied by
striking employees. _[Idelber

revolt, damaging any compromise attempt. He thinks that the State of São Paulo
should be made accountable for the violence:
