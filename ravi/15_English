Although the practice of wearing
_[hijab](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hijab)_ has been around since
pre-Islamic times, the debate surrounding it has increased in recent years.
Whereas in some countries (Saudi Arabia, Iran, parts of Afghanistan and
Indonesia), _hijab_ is mandated, in others, it has been banned in schools and
other public spaces (Turkey, Tunisia, parts of Belgium and Germany). But
whether required or forbidden, Muslim women's dress is almost always a topic
of hot debate.

Most recently, French President Nicholas Sarkozy
[proposed](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/06/23/france.burkas/index.html)
a ban on the _[burqa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa)_. His proposal
follows a 2004 French law banning _hijab_ from schools.

Bloggers around the world across the spectrum of belief have been speaking out
about Sarkozy's decision. At _KABOBfest_ , Canadian Sana
[writes](http://www.kabobfest.com/2009/07/beyond-mini-skirts-and-veils.html):

> By targeting how a small number of French women choose to assert and
> represent their sexuality, France is missing the real sources of the problem
> as well as implying that its foundation is perhaps far less stable than what
> it would like the world and its own citizenry to think. It is now time for

> has been willing to adapt for decades, but can France accept minimal equity
> as a basis for greater equality as we have done so here in North America?

The blogger concludes with:

> Mr. Sarkozy, your efforts may be sincere; you are, after all, only trying to
> protect the criteria for what makes one“French” enough. Remember, however,
> that in your attempt to free woman from her draping chains, you restrict her
> sexuality, her own sense of her individualism and her being to the confines
> of your harem by dictating the dance she must do and the garments she must
> wear to please you.

Algerian-American blogger _The Moor Next Door_ echoes a similar sentiment.
Arguing that Sarkozy's proposal is “bigotry dressed as gallantry,” he
[states](http://themoornextdoor.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/bigtory-dressed-as-
gallantry-sarko-and-the-burqa/):

> The trouble the French may want to worry about is not the burqa as it is

> will make the garment a greater symbol of Muslim identity and sign of
> cultural defiance. France has done a good job at finding ways of alienating

Farah, writing for the group blog _Nuseiba_ , presents [an excellent roundup
of Australian opinions](http://nuseiba.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/burqas-bans-
and-feeble-women/) on the matter, noting:

> A lot of writers (including Posetti and Hussein) against a ban point out
> that a number of women actively choose to wear the burqa or niqab. While the
> burqa has been used by groups to subjugate women, these writers highlight
> the need to identify the agency of these Muslim women, rather than denying
> them that agency which a ban would do.

Faith-based blogger Tracy Simmons, from the United States, sees the issue as a
simple one. Asking Sarkozy not to strip women of their dignity, she
[pleads](http://blogs.rep-am.com/matters_of_faith/?p=808):

> I don’t think people realize that wearing the burqa is a choice for many
> Islam women. And because it’s a choice, they shouldn’t be forced by a
> government NOT to wear it.

Of course, not all bloggers are opposed to Sarkozy's ban. Popular Egyptian
blogger and columnist Mona Eltahawy, who famously took off her own headscarf a
few years ago (an experience which she has written about [on her
blog](http://www.monaeltahawy.com/blog/?p=86)) wrote [an op-
ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/opinion/03iht-
edeltahawy.html?_r=4&ref=global) for _The New York Times_ in which she stated
that, as a woman and a Muslim, she was opposed to the _burqa_ being worn
anywhere.

One U.S.-based blogger, _Anne of Carversville_ , [expresses her
support](http://www.anneofcarversville.com/annes-smart-sensuality-
blog/2009/7/2/redtracker-viewpoint-we-support-mona-eltahawys-ny-times-
op-e.html) for Eltahawy by saying:

> I’m sensitive to the delicate nature of change in politics, but I have not
> lived my life to hear in 2009 that I’m offbase, because I believe that
> burqas debase women, erasing them from society as Eltahawy argues.
>
> In formalizing my position against burqas, I am in no way affronted by the
> more conservative form of dress chosen by many Muslim women. I am not
> opposed to head coverings of any kind.

More broadly, the blogger adds:

> At the same time, I support and advocate the embracing of life’s sensuality
> — seeing, hearing, smelling and using all our sensitivity to experience
> life. This view does not put me in opposition to Muslim culture, which also
> embraces the deeply sensual nature of life.
>
> I will also accept burqas for women when men are equally compelled to wear
> them. For both genders to embrace burqas as a sign of respect for their
> religion (which does not require them in the Koran), then I agree that
> burqas are a sign of Muslim culture and religious custom.

Eltahawy's column was not without opposition from the blogosphere, however.
Sahar, writing for _Nuseiba_ , protests:

> …the best way to support Muslim women is to respect their choice in how they
> express their religion and culture. It is not to impose what we think is
> good for them. I find it ironic that Eltahawy who claims to be a feminist is

> The burqa can be understood as a symbol of the outrage Muslims are feeling

Though it remains to be seen whether or not France will implement a ban on the
_burqa_ , one thing is certain: this is a very polarizing topic around the
world.
