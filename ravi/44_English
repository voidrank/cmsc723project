Following a general amnesty agreed upon by the National Assembly of the
Republic of Armenia on 19 June, several senior opposition figures on trial and
in detention for over a year since the [1 March post-election
unrest](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/03/03/armenia-eight-dead-state-of-
emergency-declared/) in the country were finally pardoned and released. Many
observers believe the trials were politically motivated.

Although _The Armenian Observer_ [EN/AM] reports that the politically
polarized blogosphere in the country was [divided on the
matter](http://ditord.com/2009/06/19/podcast-armenian-blogs-divided-on-
amnesty/), opposition bloggers were naturally elated albeit with some
concerns. _Unzipped_ , perhaps the most thought-provoking if unashamedly pro-
opposition of local blogs, [says that the amnesty does not go far
enough](http://unzipped.blogspot.com/2009/06/armenia-partial-amnesty-not-far-
enough.html).

> Unfortunately, it is not clear how (if at all) this amnesty will apply to
> those opposition activists/supporters who are on the run and in hiding now.
> Also, it became clear from the terms of declared amnesty that it will not
> apply to some political prisoners.
>
> It is always welcome to see numbers of those detained on a politically
> motivated charges reduced. However, I will only truly welcome this news if
> Armenian authorities free all of them.
>
> […] Having even one political prisoner is shameful for Armenia, deplorable
> and should not be tolerated.

_Nazarian_[also comments on how long the men were in
detention](http://hnazarian.blogspot.com/2009/06/celebration.html) and posts a
video.

_Tzitzernak2_ , however, is elated by the news, but still confused. The pro-
opposition blog also [implies that the move was made only to appease the
Council of Europe](http://tzitzernak2.blogspot.com/2009/06/just-today.html).

> Sirunyan, Hakobyan, Malkhasyan and Arzumanyan are OUT!  
>  Mikaelyan has been kept, he was given eight years, and therefore was not
> eligible….

> I still dont know what will happen to Ashot Manukyan, Jhangiryan, and

>  But, as we all knew, PACE is satisfied…

Meanwhile, on my Frontline Club blog, I describe [stumbling upon a
gathering](http://frontlineclub.com/blogs/onnikkrikorian/2009/06/political-
prisoners-released.html) where four of those detained were met by hundreds of
supporters in a Yerevan park.

> post-election disturbances which left 10 people dead.

> The Council of Europe and others, however, consider the case against the
> four men, including two MPs and a former foreign minister, to be politically

> greet them. […]

The accidental encounter also provided an opportunity to stream 20 seconds of
live video from mobile of the first and former president, now extra-
parliamentary opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrossian, standing by his former
foreign minister released earlier the same day.
