Uganda's proposed [Anti-Homosexuality Bill
2009](http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKGEE5B10DC) still awaits a final
decision by the country's Parliament, but the country's _Daily Monitor_
newspaper reported Wednesday that President Yoweri Museveni has [“assured the
US State Department of his willingness to block the
Bill”](http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/829470/-/wg7ite/-/index.html):

> President Museveni has reportedly assured American authorities that he will
> veto Ndorwa West MP David Bahati’s proposed anti-gay law, a position that
> breaks with his recent stance and the statements of officials in his
> government.
