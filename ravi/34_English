On 8 July, [Emin Milli](http://facebook.com/emin.milli), one of the founders
of a grassroots youth movement _the Alumni Network_ and [Adnan
Hajizada](http://www.facebook.com/adnan.hajizada), a video-blogger from the
[_OL! Youth Movement_](http://ol-az.blogspot.com/) have been [severely beaten
by unidentified persons while dining with a group of other civil society and
youth activists in a restaurant in downtown
Baku](http://blog.novruzov.az/2009/07/azerbaijan-two-youth-activists-
beaten.html). After complaining to police about the incident,  they were
instead detained themselves, up to a possible 48 hours.

[According to the words of one
witness](http://journaleast.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/yal-itleri/#comment-618),
as conveyed by a local blogger:

> onlar 7 nefer olublar. yemek yedikleri yerde iki idmanci icheri girib Emini
> doymeye baslayib. Adnan Emine komek etmek isteyende onu da vurublar.  
>  Idmancilar Shobede uzr isteyenden sonra onlari buraxiblar. Adnani ise 2
> sutka saxlayacaqlarini ve sonra da xuliqanliga gore hebs vereceklerini
> deyibler. Emin de Adnanla birlikde qalacagini deyib. Onlari muveqqeti
> tecridxanasiya apariblar.

They were seven people dining. Then two sportsmen entered the restaurant and
started to beat Emin Milli. When Adnan tried to help Emin, he was also beaten.
The sportsmen were released from the police station after they apologized.
However, Adnan was told that he will be detained for two days for hooliganism.
Emin stated his intention to remain with Adnan. They were both taken to
Temporary Detention Center.

Thus, according to witnesses, both of the perpetrators had been detained, but
were later released. Adnan and Emin then became the main suspects and denied
the right to meet with their lawyer. They were transferred to a detention
center handcuffed where they can be kept for up to 48 hours.

Emin has several injuries, as well as a cut on his leg, while Adnan's nose is
broken, and they haven't received sufficient medical care.

**Update:** Today, on 9 July 2009, various representatives and activists of
civil society, youth movements and political parties [have held a ‘protest
forum’ in defense of detained youth
activists](http://twitter.com/fatalin/status/2546030947). The protest forum
was characterized with [“overcrowded hall, furious speakers, plenty of civil
society and party leaders, foreign press [and] no local
TVs”](http://twitter.com/ljmaximus/status/2548861748). The German Ambassador
to Azerbaijan [has talked about one irony that tomorrow Emin Milli, who is
also a freelancing interpreter were scheduled to interprete for visiting
German Human Rights
Commissioner](http://twitter.com/bartlemot/status/2548131220). Instead,
tomorrow Emin and Adnan are going [to stand trial for
hooliganism](http://twitter.com/ljmaximus/status/2548870417). As [Bart Woord
from IFLY tweeted](http://twitter.com/bartlemot/status/2548406111) a previous
similar hooliganism charge against a journalist in Azerbaijan resulted in 2.5
years of prison term.
