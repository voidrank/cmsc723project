At any other time, Pakistan would have been abuzz about news that the
country’s National Assembly passed a bill to outlaw domestic violence last
week. [The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection)
Bill](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-pakistan-moves-to-outlaw-domestic-violence--il--
04) is the most significant administrative gesture to ensure the rights and
protection of women and children in Pakistan. The bill, which is yet to be
passed by the Senate, aims to stem domestic violence by requiring speedy
criminal trials, issuing protection orders, creating grassroots-level
protection committees, and punishing wife beaters with long jail terms and
hefty fines.

But who has time for domestic violence at a time when Pakistanis are busy
wondering whether Baitullah Mehsud, the chief of the Pakistan Taliban, [has
been killed]( https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/08/pakistan-baitullah-
mehsud-possibly-killed/), or pondering the Supreme Court’s recent,
unprecedented decision that [former president General Pervez Musharraf’s
decision to impose emergency rule was
unconstitutional](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/03/pakistan-justice-
served/).

While Pakistan’s mainstream media has provided little coverage or analysis of
the domestic violence bill, the country’s bloggers have recognized its
significance.

Blogging at _Pakistanis for Peace_ , _Manzer Munir_ [points
out](http://pakistanisforpeace.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/pakistan-poised-to-
finally-outlaw-domestic-violence-against-women/) that the bill is important at
a time when militants in Pakistan are persecuting women.

> Women have been increasingly isolated and marginalized by the spread of
> fundamentalism in many parts of Pakistan where the Taliban have brought a
> strict and narrow minded interpretation of Islam and the roles of women in
> it.

_Yasser Latif Hamdani_ at _Pak Tea House_ [celebrated the
news](http://pakteahouse.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/finally-pakistan-zindabad-
na-to-ban-domestic-violence/) of the bill:

> There is never any justification for violence against women and children.
> NEVER! This should be a wake-up call for all Pakistani men, self included,
> to behave themselves. Jinnah’s Pakistan Zindabad!

Like many Pakistanis on Twitter, _Farhan_ [shared the
news](http://twitter.com/aarpix/status/3128499107). And some tweets, such as
Abbas Azhar’s, r[emained cautiously optimistic](
http://twitter.com/abbasazher/status/3129768761?92f09b60).

> Finally, it's been a long time coming…Hopefully we don’t step backwards!

_Multipak_ [tried to clear some
misconceptions](http://multipak.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/pakistan-outlaws-
domestic-violence/) about domestic violence to stress the importance of the
bill:

> With domestic violence in mind, many would believe it to be a crime against
> the lower class women who are beaten or tortured by their husbands. This is
> wrong. According to experts, it exists in every socio-economic class, and
> can be justified on any grounds. It can be emotional which includes
> threatening a wife with severe consequences….
>
> Unfortunately, many a crimes against women are rubbed beneath the carpet in
> the garb of being a “private” affair. Thus, there is a need to restrict any
> division of space in crime.

The bill reminded _Phillygirl_ at diaspora group blog _[Sepia
Mutiny](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/005890.html)_ of the
prevalence of domestic violence in her childhood:

> For as long as I can remember, I’ve placed Pakistani culture in the category
> of indifference/acceptance when it comes to the matter of protecting women
> and children from the effects of domestic violence. As a child, domestic
> violence was an inextricable feature of the culture in which I grew up….
>
> From my parents, I continued to hear stories of women whose husbands and
> fathers slapped them around. And when I went to high school, I heard similar
> stories from other South Asian classmates. But I’m pleased that Pakistan is
> (finally!) making a small step in the right direction when it comes to
> treating domestic violence as a punishable crime as opposed to a private
> family matter.

In the most comprehensive post about the bill – which compares domestic
violence legislature with the draconian Hudood Ordinaces and contextualizes
the bill within a history of Pakistani women rights – _Sana Saleem_ at
_Mystified Justice_ takes the issue with the clause that a false complaint of
abuse is punishable with imprisonment as well as a fine. She also
[interrogates the overall effectiveness of the bill](
http://sanasaleem.com/2009/08/06/domestic-violence-bill-where-it-stands/):

>   * First and foremost getting women to actually file a report. In most
> cases women are too scared to report and have no means to do so. Keeping
> that in mind significant measures need to be taken in order to get genuine
> pleas registered.
>   * The protection committee will consist of “two police officers and two
> women councilors”. Provided the immense lack of trust people have in the
> police department, how will transparency be insured?. The Amnesty
> International report states: “When women are seriously injured by their
> husbands or families, police still discourage them from registering
> complaints and advise them to seek reconciliation with their husbands or
> families….
>   * Also while farce laws such as the Hudood ordinance,are still partly
> functional, what is the suggested fate of the domestic violence bill. The
> Hudood ordinance is a staunch reminder of the conditions of women rights in
> Pakistan.
>   * Elaboration on who will be responsible to judge the authenticity. Again
> the Hudood ordinance is responsible for many rape victims ending up in
> prison.

Meanwhile, _Tanzeel_ at _Pak Spectator_ [tried to
reconcile](http://www.pakspectator.com/domestic-violence/) the progressive
stance of the bill with conservative views on the permissiveness of domestic
violence:

> Surprisingly domestic violence is a rapidly growing problem of Islamic
> countries, though Quran clearly denies any sort of violence on women in
> anyway however our learned scholars through different interpretations have
> finally drawn conclusion to beat wife….
>
> Those who bring religious justifications to beat their wives should think on
> humanitarian lines as well, sometimes we don’t have to believe in each and
> everything just because some scholar feel that their women should be treated
> like that, with due respect I would suggest that Saudi Judge to stop
> portraying false image of Islam and avoid mixing culture with religion.
