Sun Dangyang, 25, was born in a small village. He earned his college degree in
Harbin University and was then employed by Foxconn, a Taiwanese company and
one of Apple’s largest contractors. His parents were proud of their son
however they never expected that the job and an iPhone would finally lead to
Sun’s death.

On the morning of 16, July, Sun’s body was found at the foot of his apartment
block. He left his last words to his girlfriend and some of his friends.
Though the exact cause of his death is as yet unknown, judging from his
messages, he committed suicide because he was suspected by Foxconn of stealing
an iPhone G4 prototype.

The missing iPhone was deadly to Mr Sun. The security chief of Foxconn, in
fear of Steve Jobs’ wrath, was said to have harshly interrogated Sun and
searched through his home. The reason that Sun was so heavily pressured was
that losing an iPhone prototype could mean losing the contracts from Apple
which are worth millions of dollars and thousands of jobs.

Sun’s last message to his girlfriend reads:

> “My dear, I’m sorry, go back home tomorrow, something has happened to me,
> please don’t tell my family, don’t contact me, this is the first time that I
> have ever begged you, please agree to that! I am so sorry!”

After that, he apparently committed suicide.

It could have been a normal if regrettable piece of news since suicide because
of intense commercial pressure is not so surprising in China, where the
industries are highly competitive. But [a sensational post
](http://www.tianya.cn/publicforum/content/no06/1/119172.shtml)widely
circulated on the internet changed everything. The post allegedly recorded an
online chat of Sun with one of his friends studying in France. In the online
chat which happened right at the night of his death, Sun implied that he was
beaten up and humiliated by Foxconn staff.

Sun, as the person responsible for mailing the iPhone prototype back to Apple
in US, was the major suspect according to his boss. Sun’s 3-day delay of
reporting the loss to his manager further added to suspicion of him. But in
the chat Sun explained to his friend:

(Friend)  
Calm down and think back what has happened.  
(Sun)  
There can only be two reasons for the missing iPhone.  
First, before I packed it up it had been stolen.  
Second, someone stole it that night after it was packed.  
(Friend)  
I know you are not that kind of person. But you should keep alert of others
too. Is it serious?  
(Sun)  
Though the paper box was sealed, it could be sealed afterwards with the strip
seal I put there, and I found the box had been touched by some one.  
(Friend)  
What will happen to you?  
(Sun)  
I told my boss 3 days later because I had been looking for it. I thought more
prototypes were on the streamline so I wished to handle the trouble myself.
But I had no way to find it back and I know that leaking an iPhone is very
serious a problem. So I called Jeff (his boss)

(Sun)  
Sincerely, what I said to the security department today is all true though it
might look suspicious in some places. I can understand you. If it were you I
would thought the same way.  
But I can’t afford the humiliation of my personality.

Sun then said:

“Even at a police station, the law says force must never be used, much less in
a corporate office. I was just a suspect, my dear head of security, so what
reason and right do you have to confine me and use force?”

(Friend)  
Don’t be discouraged and don’t do something overacted.  
(Sun)  
It is my fault. I am sorry. But it was f**king not me that took the iPhone.

(friend)  
So you should live on to show to those bastards that you are innocent.  
(Sun)  
But this time, I guess something much worse would soon happen. I might be
beaten up again without any reason and thrown to the police station? I don’t
know.  
(Friend)  
Sun, be careful now, keep evidence and don’t resist when there is no way out.  
(Sun)  
The place that confined me doesn’t have CCTV! F**king a**hole. So many times
had I been there but I had never found the place. I can't tell how many people
had been bullied over there.

Thanks my colleagues in this one year. It was a great time with you.
Particularly my dear chief Jeff. Appreciate your help. I had so many problems
and you always help me deal with the customers.

I was so pissed off, dear security chief. Hope you will get your retribution.
Though you can beat me and make a new machine soon, it is the power of
Foxconn, but not you.  
Yes, one thing more. I am still paying back the interest of my college loan.
Hope it won’t affect my brother and sister. Sorry for that. See you, my
friend. I feel much better thinking that I don’t have to be bullied anymore
and I don't need to be a scapegoat.

Two hours later, Sun apparently jumped from the top of the building.

The record was verified and thought to be authentic. Journalists soon found
the security chief, Gu Qinming mentioned by Sun. Gu Qinming replied:

> 顾钦明说，7月15日13时30分许，在获悉苹果公司一部手机样机丢失后，他去了孙丹勇说的包装现场，孙丹勇模拟了当时交接手机的现场，并说交接时他中间离开了一会儿。

On 15, July, I went to the site where Sun allegedly packed up the iPhones. Sun
described the scene where he received the phones from the production
department, and said he left for a while during the process.

> 第一次调查结束后，从当时与孙丹勇交接产品的女同事处了解到，产品交接时孙丹勇一直在场，这与此前孙丹勇说他曾中途离开不一致，所以要跟他对一下细节。

But after the first investigation, I heard from his female colleague that he
was there during the entire process, different from what he said, so I need to
check it out with him.

He also denied that he searched Sun’s home by force.

>
> 顾钦明说，搜家是孙丹勇提出的。我们让孙丹勇回忆细节时，他突然提出，为表清白，到他家看看。“我当时觉得不很妥当，但孙丹勇挺坚持的，我就说要是去的话，就写个同意书签个字。”

It was Sun himself who asked us to search his house so that he can be proven
innocent. ‘I thought it was not so appropriate but he insisted on that. So I
asked him to sign an agreement.

Not many people trust the apology of Foxconn.

I am working in Foxconn too. I feel exactly the same with what the post
states. Everyone who has worked there would feel the same. Indeed, that’s the
way Foxconn is.

Good luck on your journey to another world. I am working in Foxconn too. I
have to say that we have no dignity at all. The mainlander cadres are like the
dogs of those senior chiefs from Taiwan. They crushed the grassroots together.

82926303 said Foxconn is too powerful a company to beat:

> 意，因为不想惹祸上身，多一事不如少一事，富士康太厉害了，因为根源有政府的支持，因为有钱，因为有专业的有名的法律团队……

No TV station would expose the dark side of Foxconn, even if you give them
money. Foxconn is so powerful that they got the government support and have
enough money and well-known lawyer team.

On the internal forum of Foxconn, there are also posts regretting Sun’s death
and complaining about Foxconn’s suppressing atmosphere. Taiwan businessmen are
thought to be just like foreign suppressors.

Sigh! The businessmen from Japan and Taiwan don’t treat Chinese workers as
human. But so what? The mainstream media doesn’t report on the issue at all.
Neither did the government do anything. Who on earth would stand up to protect
the life and dignity of Chinese labor?
