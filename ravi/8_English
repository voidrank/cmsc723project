[Olympic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games) gold medalist and world
record holder in the 100 and 200 meter events,
[Jamaican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica) [Usain
Bolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt), sprinted to an even more
impressive victory this past weekend at the [IAAF World
Championships](http://www.berlin2009.org/1-1-home.html) in Berlin, clocking
9.58 seconds [to beat his own
record](http://dailynews.runnersworld.com/2009/08/august-17.html). Regional
bloggers are in a celebratory mood, particularly in Jamaica…

_[Life, Unscripted, on the
Rock](http://jamaicandawta.wordpress.com/2009/08/16/another-bolt-out-of-the-
blue/)_ unabashedly says:

> Mi glad bag buss!
>
> BIG UP, Bolt and Asafa. [Lightning Bolt
> scorched](http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2009-08-16-track-worlds-
> day-2_N.htm), and Asafa [Powell, who took home the bronze for Jamaica in a
> time of 9.84] showed us what he’s made of.
>
> Congratulations are also due to all the Caribbean participants on a job well
> done.

_[Abeng News Magazine](http://www.abengnews.com/?p=1971)_ writes of the
victory:

> Usain Bolt’s sizzling 9.58 sec world record 100 meters run on Sunday gave
> Jamaicans one more reason to celebrate, despite the tough economic times
> facing the island.

The significance of the achievement is not lost on _[The Phoenix in a Gas
House](http://zephyrbaby.blogspot.com/2009/08/985-for-bolt.html)_ :

> One day Usain Bolt is going to do something that a normal human being might
> do. He'll spill his tea, or drop his chicken nuggets, or trip over his
> shoelaces.
>
> One day. For now, he astonishes and astounds with everything he does.
>
> Almost exactly 73 years ago in this Olympiastadion, Jesse Owens produced an
> athletic performance that made sporting history. Before Sunday night, it
> seemed impossible that anyone could ever match those deeds.
>
> That was before 9.58 seconds. That was before Usain landed.
>
> The greatest 100m in history? Surely. The greatest sprinter ever?
> Unquestionably.

Bloggers from [Trinidad and
Tobago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago) also put in their
two cents’ worth. _[Trinidad and Tobago News
Blog](http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/blog/?p=1373)_ calls the win
“amazing” and _[ttgapers.com](http://www.ttgapers.com/News/2009/8/17/usain-
bolt-shatters-100m-world-record-958/)_ says:

> Usain Bolt proved again he races in a world all his own.
