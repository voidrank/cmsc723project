At time of writing, a [counter added](http://ol-az.blogspot.com/) to the _OL!
Azerbaijani Youth Movement_ blog shows that online youth activists Adnan
Hajizade and Emin Milli have been in detention for 14 days now. The two video
bloggers were [taken into police custody on 8
July](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/08/azerbaijan-youth-activists-
beaten-and-detained/) on what many consider to be trumped up charges of
“hooliganism.”

Despite significant outcry from leading human rights groups, press freedom
watchdogs, as well as the international community itself, the two men were
sentenced to two months pre-trial detention on 10 July in a court hearing
[held behind closed
doors](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/11/azerbaijan-youth-activist-
blogger-sentenced-after-trial-behind-closed-doors/).

Their appeal, [originally planned for last
week](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/19/azerbaijan-activists-support-
site-goes-down/), was eventually heard on Monday, but few expected the
bloggers to be released. In a comment made on my _Frontline Club_ post, _Al
Jazeera English's_ Matthew Collin [summed up the mood outside the
courtroom](http://frontlineclub.com/blogs/onnikkrikorian/2009/07/video-
petition-for-detained-azeri-youth-activists-bloggers.html#comment-1793).

> I was there outside the appeals court in Baku yesterday, and there was a
> sense of deep sadness among the activists’ close friends that all the
> international coverage of this case, and the critical statements from
> European and US officials, hasn't moved the authorities to drop this case
> and end what seems to have turned into a global embarrassment for
> Azerbaijan's government.

The video report is available on _YouTube_ , and Collin also [made his own
post](http://caucasusreports.blogspot.com/2009/07/no-freedom-for-donkey-
satirists.html) on _This is Tbilisi Calling_. The journalist-blogger noted the
feeling of vulnerability among independent voices in Baku.

> I'm in Baku to cover the case for Al Jazeera, and people working in what
> remains of the independent media here in Azerbaijan have been telling me
> they are increasingly nervous about who the authorities might target next.
> This is a country where critical journalists have often been jailed,
> assaulted and even killed, where international broadcasters have been forced
> off the airwaves, and where television is relentlessly pro-government. Now
> anti-government bloggers have received what some of them perceive to be a
> warning not to step out of line too often.

_Facebook_ and _Twitter_ were used to mobilize youth outside the court room
for the appeal, but only a reported 60-70 supporters turned up. Moreover,
because of severe restrictions on the right to freedom of assembly, none
carried placards or chanted out slogans.

However, there were very few updates on the trial until the very end when the
appeal was rejected. All seemed unsurprised by the decision.

Nevertheless, _Twitter_ was used to [get news of the appeal court decision out
first](http://www.mediahelpingmedia.org/content/view/454/1/). Comments and
updates on _Facebook_ from supporters of the two men worldwide also appeared
almost instantaneously, leading _Flying Carpets and Broken Pipelines_ to write
a blog post [based on my
own](http://flyingcarpetsandbrokenpipelines.blogspot.com/2009/07/selling-your-
soul-to-devil-what-money.html).

> When, […] the court rejected both of the appeals […], a good friend of mine-

Nevertheless, the blogger ends on a more optimistic note.

> There are messages circling on Facebook saying to stay strong and be united.
> I couldn't agree more!

Some even updated their status lines in _Facebook_ or sent out tweets quoting
Hajizade.

_Thoughts on the Road_ also [commented on the court's
decision](http://poliscimedia.blogspot.com/2009/07/appeal-of-bloggers-
rejected.html).

> The news via Twitter is that the appeal of Emin Milli & Adnan Hajizade has
> been rejected. Not many more details available at this point. On the
> Facebook pages this morning – expressions of disgust & frustration. The
> natural regret for hoping against hope that an undemocratic government would
> respect human rights. But the face of the Azerbaijani government is
> unmistakable. It is not democratic. It is not concerned with human rights.
> It is not concerned with fairness or justice.

In the face of such criticism, _Thoughts on the Road_ also says that the
government-controlled media is now trying to turn the circumstances of the
case around. The blog says that it [doesn't believe a word of
it](http://poliscimedia.blogspot.com/2009/07/heres-what-really-happened-
according-to.html).

> […] Amazing. […] Emin and Adnan are depicted as ruffians, drinking and
> swearing in a restaurant. Babek Huseynov and his associates were just some
> peaceful guys who wanted some peace and quiet, so they approached Emin and
> Adnan, asking the guys to quiet down. […] The fact that Emin and Adnan were
> pro-democracy activists is not mentioned in the article. Of course.
>
> Now, I have never met Emin or Adnan personally and I was not in that
> Lebanese restaurant that night. I have, however, eaten in that very
> restaurant. It was noisy when I ate there. I find it incredible that Emin
> and Adnan were being that much noisier than anyone else. […] If Adnan and
> Emin were so out of hand, would the management allow them to be so
> disruptive? Perhaps if Emin and Adnan had been well-connected government
> officials, this might be possible. But they are not and the scenario
> described here is completely implausible.
>
> No, the story published here doesn't smell right at all. It isn't even

> is any color but blue.

Meanwhile, supporters of the two imprisoned activists and bloggers continue to
work locally and internationally to have them released. Many believe they face
an uphill struggle, but the [extensive use of social
media](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/13/azerbaijan-citizen-media-in-
defense-of-detained-activists/), including a [video
petition](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/16/azerbaijan-video-campaign-
to-release-detained-activists/), means that the case is still in the public
eye.

For now at least, they appear committed and dedicated in that campaign to
prevent the authorities from frustrating the emergence of a progressive youth
movement in Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, however, the case might well have
ramifications for bloggers and youth activists across the entire region.
Indeed, some already believe that to be the case.
