Extremely low voter turnout is a major issue in Japan. For example, voter
turnout for Japan's recent [Lower
House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_%28Japan%29)
election held on [December 17,
2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_general_election,_2014) — in which
voters had a say about who the prime minister would be — was just
[52.66%](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soumu.go.jp%2Fmain_content%2F000328867.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHRyGwlR3CA0arM25J5TmE8x3Jfig),
the lowest voter turnout in Japan since the end of the Second World War.

Various factors contributed to low voter turnout in this past election,
including poor weather that was so bad in some parts of the country that
voters could not make it to polls. However, another trend is contributing to
low voter turnout: voter participation among Japanese millennials is extremely
scant, according to [the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soumu.go.jp%2Fsenkyo%2Fsenkyo_s%2Fnews%2Fsonota%2Fnendaibetu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHueSllwJDeV5s17luD_mtGh1w7qw).

What is the main cause of the low turnout among the young generation? On the
one hand, the [cohort of younger voters is relatively
smaller](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.go.jp%2Fdata%2Fjinsui%2Fpdf%2F201501.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGpr8ZJgavhqKlXjZdAaDNn6ba5QQ)
than in the past; this is partly because of declining birthrates.

At the same time, it's said that Japanese people don't really consider
politics to have any connection with their lives. For example, a recent[
survey conducted by public broadcaster
NHK](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww9.nhk.or.jp%2Fnw9%2Fmarugoto%2F2014%2F03%2F0319.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHy5HRciRgvEg9D-03G5kyPl7olUQ)
revealed a sense of distrust young people feel towards elections — they
believe that “their votes can change nothing”.

Meanwhile, there are some young people in Japan who have been making numerous
efforts to encourage youth participation in politics.

[YouthCreate](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fyouth-
create.jp%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGvN6nDeVVU-v5X23EY_2EHWgP3mQ) is a non-
profit led by 29-year-old [Kensuke
Harada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkensuke.harada&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEgtXEO7OMP_6aICG1GRoWtIIT7cA).
Harada became alarmed by what he perceived to be a lack of interest by his
fellow youth in the political process in Japan. As a result, Harada decided to
establish the student group
“[ivote](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.i-vote.jp%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEwAIYDDqm9srf0obH_JuqZXd16KA)”
with his friends.

Since then, the ivote team has worked at increasing voting rate among people
in their 20s. Harada established YouthCreate to continue his campaign with his
comrades after graduation.

Harada talked to [Huffington Post
Japan](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.jp%2F2014%2F11%2F25%2Fwakamonotoseiji_n_6222834.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH0SjpL4DZlnxr-
uj0TYSmEk4nDPw) about the cause of low voter turnout among the Japan's younger
generation:

>
> 理由は色々あると思いますが、一番多いのは、選挙で何かが変わろうが、政治がどう動こうが、自分たちの生活や将来は良い方向に変わらないよね、というイメージ。その背景には、政治への不信感があると思います。政治って、自分とは遠い「向こう側」で勝手にやってて、そんなに良いものじゃないし、若い世代が声を上げたとしても数の多い高齢者世代には勝てないでしょ、という人は多いですね。

> I think there are various reasons [for low voter turnout in Japan]. That

> that their lives will never change for the better no matter how politics
> change. This attitude itself is caused by a sense of distrust towards
> politics. Many of the youth think that politics is automatically functioning
> on “the other side” of them and that their relatively fewer number of voices
> are drowned out by voices of the more numerous older generations.

Harada also said that the younger generation in Japan “cannot imagine exactly
how it is like when politicians say they are willing to get back the booming
economy of good old days”, since the young generation have never experienced
life during the “bubble” economy.

Having working as an intern in the office of a Japanese member of parliament
after graduating from university, Harada started to feel the need to connect
the youth and politicians:

>
> 政治って大事だなって思いました。政治家、スタッフ、行政、彼らを取材するメディアを含めて、全員とはいわないけれど、地域を良くしたい、日本を良くしたいという思いがあることに気づきました。でも、そういう政治に関わっている人の思いが、若い人には伝わってなかった。[…]
>
> これではいけないと思いました。結果として、政治は投票に行ってくれる上の世代を優先するし、若い世代は政治と自分は関係ないと思っている。[…]
>
>
> 若い世代と政治は敵ではないと思います。ただ、お互いのことを知らない結果、お互い相手が何を考えているのかわからないイメージになっている。若者が「どうせ政治家は何もやってくれない」といい、政治家も「若者は社会のことを何も考えていない」となるのはとてももったいないし、すごく悔しい。少しでも接点を作れば、関係性が変わってきて、日本の将来も変わるのかなと思っています

> I found politics very important, realizing many politicians, their staffs,

> hoping to improve their regions or the entire country itself. However, the
> vision of these politicians has not reached the young generation of Japanese

> “politicians do nothing for us” while politicians say “the youth think
> nothing about the society”. If there is even a slight connection between
> them, their relationship possibly begins to change to make a difference in
> the future of Japan.

Included in his efforts to change youth towards participating in elections,
Harada pays special attention to the annual “coming-of-age ceremony” where
young people receive formal societal recognition for turning 20.

In Japan the voting age starts at 20, and the “coming-of-age ceremony” is
therefore a good opportunity to change the perception among Japan's youth that
“politics are very far” from them.

To give the “new adults” an experience of “changing something by voting”,
Harada launched an “imitation election”
[project](http://haraken0814.blogspot.jp/2015/02/blog-post.html#more) to let
youth themselves vote for the subjects they want the mayor to address during
the coming-of-age ceremony.

Harada and his organization have also launched a “[Voters
Bar](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fvotersbar.net%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEIEy4XmkwHOGyPN3aXNyUV3F3bkg)”,
a campaign to provide a place for both politicians and the youth to gather and
interact. Harada says by providing opportunities for communicating with
politicians in person, youth gradually realize that politicians a”re ordinary
adults as well”.

workshops as one of their activities.

Harada, who has witnessed the positive effects of interactions between the
youth and politicians, sends a message to the younger generation: “What we
need to show politicians is, more than voter numbers, how much more engaged
and influential these young voters can be”.

According to Harada:

>
> 投票行っても何も変わらないというのは、間違いです。行ったら変わります。若い世代は人数が少ないから政治は動かないと思っているかもしれませんが、若者の投票率が上がったり、自分の政党に若者の支持が集まったりということになれば、票数は少ないかもしれませんが、動き自体に力がある。[…]今、投票して声を上げておかないと、10年後に何もしなかったと思うことになるのは、悔しくないですか?
> 僕が投票する理由の一番は、後悔するのが嫌だからです

> I go to vote — I do not want to regret what I did not do afterward.
