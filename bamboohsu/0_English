Tanzania is set to make [a historic shift
away](http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/national/Bye-Std-VII-exams--English--
Karibu-Kiswahili-in-studies/-/1840392/2623428/-/2krj4x/-/index.html) from
English and replace it with[
Swahili](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_Wikipedia) as the language of
instruction in the country’s schools.

The new education system launched by President Jakaya Kikwete on February 13,
2015, in line with [National Vision
2025](https://www.google.com.na/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDIQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.worldbank.org%2Farchive%2Fwebsite01013%2FWEB%2FIMAGES%2FTANZANIA.DOC&ei=l1nrVJPxBtbaaumJgqgF&usg=AFQjCNG4r178-K-yMEalXVltlisOrA4NvQ&sig2=jFhF5sqjcmI9Z6xV7tCN-w)
will also extend basic education from seven years to 11 years, provide free
education at primary and education levels and abolish national examinations
for primary school levers.

This appears to be one of the first times that a country in Africa will teach
students at all levels in an African language instead of a foreign language.

Commenting on the language shift, Atetaulwa Ngatara, the assistant director
for policy at the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training,
[said](http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/national/Bye-Std-VII-exams--English--
Karibu-Kiswahili-in-studies/-/1840392/2623428/-/2krj4x/-/index.html) English
will still be taught as a language, but for students to learn English it's not
necessary that all their subjects be taught in it.

[Oliver Stegen](https://www.facebook.com/oliver.stegen), a Swahili speaker of
German origin and a linguistic advisor at language development non-profit [SIL

saying that English has turned the educated class into robots:

not everyone needs to go to university but everyone deserves a good basic

However, not everyone was in support of the new education system. Steve
Nicolle [pointed
out](https://www.facebook.com/oliver.stegen/posts/10206039647928426?comment_id=10206040853918575&offset=0&total_comments=18)
one possible effect of the new policy:

> I suspect one effect of this legislation will be an increase in enrollments
> in private schools that continue to offer tuition in English. Keep an eye
> open for politicians opening new English medium schools in the near future!

Elly Gudo agreed with Steve Nicole, [arguing
that](https://www.facebook.com/oliver.stegen/posts/10206039647928426?comment_id=10206042685844372&offset=0&total_comments=18)
politicians will be the main beneficiaries of the policy:

> I totally agree with Steve Nicolle. Having lived in Tanzania, I can tell you
> for sure that politicians are the highest beneficiaries of this new policy.
> Majority of Tanzanian middle and all upper classes who have identified with
> the global village will do anything to take their children to English Medium
> Schools. The common man's child will then be highly disadvantaged when it
> comes to University admission and by extension job acquisition. After 2
> decades, the country will be highly classified. Tanzania needs a French-type
> Revolution in many facets.

Opposing the policy, Muddyb Mwanaharakati [said](

the following in Swahili:

> Oliver Stegen usichekelee. Wametia siasa ndani yake. Watoto zao wanasoma
> international schools. Sisi akina kajamba nani tutasoma zilezile S.t
> vichochoroni ili tubaki na Kiingereza chetu cha ya, ya, yes no yes no.
> Wakati watoto wao wanamwaga ngeli ya maana. Sijaifurahia hatua hii. Kwetu
> bado sana Oliver hata matangazo na sehemu nyingi ya masuala ya serikali yapo
> Kiingereza.

> Oliver Stegen do not make me laugh. They have politicised the issue. Their
> children go to international schools [where the language of instruction is
> English]. We, the poor ones, will continue with going to under performing
> and poorly equipped schools and continue with our English of ya, ya, yes no
> yes no. At the same time their children are speaking English fluently. We

the new policy is not as radical as people think:

> You need to read carefully what the policy says: it says Swahili will be
> used at all levels and ALSO says English will be used at all levels (that
> means including primary level). So my interpretation is that the only NEW

> that local government authorities can convert existing primary schools to
> become English medium.

Reacting to the same article posted on [Trending
Kenya](http://www.trending.co.ke/tanzania-has-ditches-
english-a-994979614.html), Margaret Njeru [explained that](
http://trending.co.ke/tanzania-has-ditches-
english-a-994979614.html?fb_comment_id=fbc_925081217532217_925623847477954_925623847477954)
the new system does not kick out foreign or second languages but put them in
their appropriate places in the learning process:

> Indeed, bold and in the right direction. Education is about development, and
> that development can only come through a language a people make sense of.
> The world over, none of the so-called developed economies operates in a
> foreign language, and the use of the former colonial languages in many
> African countries has definitely contributed to the marginalization of the
> majority in the development process. If we have to define “our” development
> path, then the language choice must go hand-in-hand with it. And this does
> not in any way mean kicking out the foreign (or second languages), rather
> putting them in their appropriate place in the learning process.

it is time Africans used their languages:

> It is about time that our African countries should speak our own dialects
> such as Twi, Yoruba, Swahili and Mandingo. English wasn't our original
> language in the first place and we need to wake-up and go back to our

The shift is monumental but it comes with significant challenges, [noted](
