In Japan, the new school year starts in April. As the school year winds down
in March, many families will be starting to think about uniforms and school
supplies for the month ahead.

For many Japanese preschoolers
_[uwabaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwabaki)_ (indoor shoes) are an
ubiquitous part of school life. Students, teachers, and visitors alike are all
required to remove their street shoes before entering the school.

With their elastic straps, _uwabaki_ are easy to put on for young children,
and the rubberized toes provide traction on slippery surfaces in the school.

In recent years, attitudes in Japan towards school uniforms have softened.
While _uwabaki_ may be mandatory, in some parts of Japan it is now okay to
_deko_ (decorate) _uwabaki_.

Some parents decorate the _uwabaki_ themselves for their kids, while stores
now sell _uwabaki_ that feature popular cartoon and _manga_ characters.

[Yokai Watch](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/11/04/popular-video-game-

course a frequent theme with _uwabaki deko_ :

It's pretty obvious that there must be some _uwabaki deko_ kits for sale:

The parents get as much enjoyment out of _uwabaki deko_ as the kids:
