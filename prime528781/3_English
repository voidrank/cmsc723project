**_Global Voices recently asked our editors: What is the most misunderstood
aspect of the place you live, or where you're from?_**

**_Their responses will be published as part of an ongoing series debunking
myths and offering a more nuanced take on certain parts of the world._ _The
latest installment is by Global Voices Japan editor Nevin Thompson, who splits
his time between Canada and Japan._**

The question I get asked the most in Japan: ‚ÄúAre you American?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, sorry,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúI'm actually originally from Canada.‚Äù I've lived in
Japan, on and off, since 1994. Depending on the situation, it's considered
polite to express interest in whoever you're talking to by asking personal
questions.

‚ÄúOh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature,‚Äù is the standard reply to my
clarification. A lot of Canadians might seeth inwardly at being mistaken for
an American, but I don't mind. To the untrained eye, there's very little to
distinguish Canadians from Americans. This is one reason why so many
Canadians, when traveling, put a prominent Canadian flag on their backpacks.
Everybody loves Canadians. Americans, on the other hand‚Ä¶

It's been like this ever since I started traveling 20 years ago, before Donald
Trump, before the invasion of Iraq, and before 9/11. Canadians put little
maple leaves on their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American
cousins.

We have [free health
care!](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/health.aspx) There aren't any
[guns here](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/)! Same-sex
marriage has been legal in Canada [since
2005](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/07/02/how-canada-led-
the-way-on-same-sex-marriage.html)!

Everybody, it seems, thinks Canada is so nifty. We're
[polite](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Canadians-portrayed-as-extremely-
polite-people-in-US-sitcoms). We apparently say
‚Äú[sorry](http://www.cbc.ca/2017/sorry-can-we-talk-about-why-canadians-
apologize-so-much-1.3939997)‚Äù a lot. Canada is supposedly perceived to be [the
most tolerant country](https://www.oecd.org/berlin/47570353.pdf) towards
ethnic groups. We're not like those other guys south of the border. Canadians
are nice.

I hate it.

For one thing, I have many American friends I greatly admire. I wouldn‚Äôt mind
being mistaken, for instance, for Johnny from Dallas. Marc from Austin. Adam
from San Francisco. Or Michael from Honolulu.

As well, there are a couple of problems with being labeled as ‚Äúnice.‚Äù Number
one: to be called ‚Äúnice‚Äù is to essentially be called a square, much like the
sweet, gentle but tragically ineffectual [Ned Flanders
character](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Ned_Flanders) from ‚Äú[The
Simpsons](https://twitter.com/TheSimpsons)‚Äù (who has [his own Canadian
doppleganger](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Midnight_Rx)).

If Canada could in fact be a nation of Ned Flanderses, it would be an
improvement, but the real problem is that nice doesn't have any personality.
There are no hard edges, and nothing pushes back. To be inoffensive is to be
unremarkable and uninteresting, unworthy of attention. This can be a good
thing if your desire is to blend into the background, and remain aloof from
what's going on around you.

I'd argue that the desire to remain unengaged and alone is in fact a primary
characteristic of being Canadian. We tend to mind our own business. What
outsiders regard as being ‚Äúnice‚Äù might actually be cold politeness. Canadians
don't engage much in over-the-fence conversations with neighbours. We lack the
warm, open friendliness I've come to associate with my American friends.

Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau showed up to
make being Canadian more than just nice: our prime minister has made our
country positively sexy.

Tall, handsome, athletic and a [male feminist](https://youtu.be/FUtRnkm1GlY),
JT has transformed Canada from a country known for little more than ice hockey
and [milk that's sold in plastic
bags](http://mentalfloss.com/article/81468/why-do-canadians-drink-milk-bags),
to a bastion of tolerance, and a refuge from the problems of the world.

Indeed, the day after getting elected in October 2015, Trudeau shifted the
tone of discourse in Canada by 180 degrees. After an election campaign that
saw his Conservative opponent propose [banning the
niqab](https://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/10/07/harper-
pitting-country-against-muslims-some-niqab-wearers-say.html), [Trudeau
immediately posed for selfies with Muslim
Canadians](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/justin-trudeau-snaps-
selfies-at-montreal-s-jarry-metro-station-1.3279728) in the Montreal Metro.

Next, the Trudeau government pledged to bring in 25,000 refugees to Canada in
just a few months, after the previous government had waffled on helping
alleviate the refugee crisis at all. The Trudeau government's refugee plan
[has been more or less a success so
far](http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canadian-refugee-limits-leave-little-room-
for-those-affected-by-u-s-ban-1.3263676).

So, in 2017, thanks to a lot of [international
adulation](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/28/world/trudeau-macron-bromance-trnd/)
and newfound sex appeal, Canadians have begun to feel we are more than nice.
We're hip, cool and tolerant. But are we really?

Because the myth of the ‚Äúnice Canadian‚Äù also prevents Canadians from truly
addressing some of our fundamental problems that are not going away anytime
soon. [Nearly 20% of children](http://www.cwp-csp.ca/poverty/just-the-facts/)
in Canada live in poverty, and nearly half of First Nations children. There is
a [housing crisis in
Canada](https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/05/23/obsession-with-home-
ownership-driving-toronto-affordability-crisis-report-finds.html), accompanied
by a [homelessness crisis](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/30-000-canadians-are-
homeless-every-night-1.1413016). On a per capita basis, [Canadians lead the
world](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/2112500/4462-ghg-emissions-
report-v03f.pdf) in greenhouse gas emissions.

Every country has its problems, of course, and there are plenty of great
things about Canada. (I personally like British Columbia's amazing assortment
of [craft breweries](http://www.straight.com/food/914066/world-turns-its-
attention-bc-thanks-brewery-boom-and-events-vancouver-craft-beer-week) and the
Montreal ‚Äú[DIY music
scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_DIY_music_scene)‚Äú, for
starters).

But enough with the brand of ‚Äúnice.‚Äù It's a cop out for Canada, and prevents
us from really achieving true greatness as a country.
