Social networks strongly tie a person to themselves. The person opens a page
under his/her name, puts out photographs, indicates interests, joins groups
and communities, writes notes, shares impressions and thoughts. What happens
to this page when the person dies?

Being a recent phenomena, social networks haven't yet worked out how to
reflect a user's death. A person dies but his/her profile remains and he/she
continues to smile on photographs and the life is still present in his/her
friend feed. One can even write on a wall of the diseased. The person doesn't
exist and real life buts still lives on the Net.

Very often, especially if we are talking about _LiveJournal_ [Russian most
popular blogging platform – G.V.], the last entry of a person who passed away
becomes a book of condolence. For instance, after the [death of Ilya
Kormiltsev](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/18/russia-bloggers-
remember-rock-legend/), a famous Russian poet and author of many popular
songs, [one his last posts](http://karmakom.livejournal.com/35204.html "one of
his last posts") [RUS] with just a phrase “A personal request. Is there anyone
going to London these days? The medicines are needed. For me.” has received
1,752 comments. In general, the comments were short – R.I.P – but [not all of
them](http://karmakom.livejournal.com/35204.html?thread=1849988#_blank) [RUS]:

> Goodbye, Ilya. Thank you for being.

Poet Anna Yablonskaya [died](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/29/russia-
ukraine-more-tributes-to-playwright-anna-yablonskaya/) in a terrorist attack
in Moscow airport Domodedovo in January 2011. Once this became known, many
people visited [her blog](http://silkhat.livejournal.com/), [RUS] to leave
condolences. The readers found in her blog a [post dated back to December 21,
2010](http://silkhat.livejournal.com/273423.html) [RU] where Anna, as it
seemed, had anticipated her death:

> I have a feeling that I have very little time…

Some online media outlets even posted articles entitled “Anna Yablonskaya
Anticipated Her Death.”

The topic of death and social networks has got its development last week.

Online media found out a tragic story that happened on February 27, 2011 in
the village Beliy Yar of the [Tomsk
region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomsk_Oblast) in Siberia. Vladimir
Ignatenko, 26, has been locked in a backoffice and lit on fire. Apparently it
was done by police officers. The young man could not get out except through
the door that was blocked. Realizing that the fire is spreading, Vladimir
started writing posts on his profile at « _Оdnoklassniki_ », a popular Russian
social network, and chatting online with one of his friends Yevgenia. The
first message is dated back to 2.23 AM and the last one – 3.04 AM. The
interval between the messages was 5-7 minutes when Vladimir had probably tried
to extinguish the fire.

> Vladimir Ignatenko: Good bye. Sorry that I have no time to heal you.

>  Vladimir Ignatenko: the door is locked and I’m on fire!!!  
>  Yevgenia: What? Why can't you call anyone?  
>  Vladimir Ignatenko: No, they told me at the local emergency department: ah,
> that’s you!!! Well [that's – GV] for Misha!!!  
>  Yevgenia: What are you talking about? Who is Misha?

>  Vladimir Ignatenko: Windows are barred, and there are policemen outside.
> They did it… And I know that I will die.  
>  Yevgenia: I’m shocked. How can this happen? Do something! It’s not

>  Vladimir Ignatenko: I am doing something, I am not an idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!
> Well, farewell!!!

The young man had been burned alive. During the fire Vladimir Ignatenko wrote
two status messages at his Odnoklassniki page. The first one was:

> Waiting for the death is worse than the death itself!!!!

And the second entry, which was also the last one:

> The life is good, goodbye my friends. The death is beautiful. Sorry for this
> nonsense!!! I punished myself for Galina only and only for one mistake the
> policemen killed me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Vladimir Ignatenko’s mother found out this posts on his page, turned to the
police and this story became known on the Internet.

Last week, “[Mother’s right](http://mright.hro.org/),” an NGO defending the
rights of servicemen, has launched a new project at the Odnoklassniki.ru. They
created accounts of young men who died serving in the armed forces during
peace time as a result of hazing or commanders’ mistakes.

[![Accounts of dead soldiers, screenshot from

There are 30 accounts. Each has a photo with a mourning ribbon and a soldier’s
story. All stories are written after the court decisions have been made, all
mentioned facts have been proven correct. The places of studies have been
added for each young man so his classmates can find out about their tragic
fate. There is one example:

> **_Evgeniy Shamukhin._**  
>  **_I died in the Academy of the Ministry for emergency situations._**  
>  _Place of study: school 391, Saint Petersburg._  
>  _Employment: Research institute Transmash (Transportation Machinery – GV),
> Saint Petersburg_

This project has received great attention on the Russian Internet. No one has
ever created accounts for dead people in Russia before. The fact that the
topic of death is entering the social networks, a space originally perceived
as private and intimate, makes the death equally private for people. This way
the Internet users attract attention to the cases of death in the army during
peace time.

There is no field “date of death” in the profiles of social networks yet. And
who would fill this out? Recently, _Livejournal_ has started “freezing” the
journals of dead people for comments by writing the following: «This journal
is a memorial. New entries cannot be posted to it.»
