Unrest between supporters of Cote d'Ivoire's two opposing leaders, Laurent
Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara, has taken a further violent turn. Since December
3, 2011, both politicians have claimed to have won the November 2010
presidential election.

Ivorian women [have held demonstrations
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/04/cote-divoire-can-the-calls-for-
peace-be-heard/)against the political situation since February 25, 2011.

**Bloody Thursday**

What was supposed to be a peaceful march ended up as a bloodbath on Thursday
March 3, 2011. During an all female
[protest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDdrHmZh5rI) organised in Abobo, a
pro-Ouattara district of economic capital Abidjan, seven women were shot dead,
apparently by Gbagbo's national Defense and Security Forces.

Videos of the gunfire rapidly spread online via video sharing service Youtube.

Youtube user [Dreamdav](http://www.youtube.com/user/dreamdav) posted a seven
minute long video, in which unarmed women can be seen chanting “ADO” (Alassane
Dramane Ouattara), when suddenly (at 3:32), national police tanks shoot at the
demonstrators, dispersing them and forcing them to seek shelter.

Other citizen videos posted show the same incident (WARNING: GRAPHIC).

This video posted by [SuperDjatou](http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperDjatou)
and shot by a protestor within the crowd shows the confusion a few seconds
after the gun shots:

Another video shows four dead bodies lying on the ground:

Sadness and anger are just some of the feelings being shared by Ivorians
netizens and others in the wake of the attack. Here are some of the reactions
from social microblogging network Twitter, sent to the hashtag being used for
the unrest, [#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search/civ2010).

[@KDGF2505](http://twitter.com/#!/KDGF2505/status/43677202075750401) replying
to another Twitter user says:

> narrow-minded are ones killing innocent women…do you think that hatred can
> be stopped in that way?

[@SenamBeheton](http://twitter.com/#!/SenamBeheton/status/43676709551226880),
a Twitter user from Benin names the 7 dead women “martyrs”:

> La boucherie d'Abobo (8 martyres) est une erreur grave que Gbagbo
> regrettera.

Abobo slaugther (8 martyrs) is a serious mistake that Gbagbo will regret.

[@kanazan](http://twitter.com/#!/kanazan/status/43706140453904384) reminds us
that International women day is arriving soon and wonders:

> comment celebrerons nous le 8 mars en? #civ2010 femmes abattues …

How will we celebrate March 8 in Côte d'Ivoire? women killed..

**Pointing Blame**

In an [article](http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012323522-abidjan-bascule-
dans-la-guerre-civile) [fr] published on the website of French daily paper
_Liberation_ , a source claims that the people who shot the women were in a
4×4 vehicle. When contacted via email, the journalist behind the article,
Thomas Hofnung, confirmed that the source is reliable.

According to another testimony by a military source to a
[Reuters](http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Monde/Actu/Cote-d-Ivoire-Sept-
femmes-tuees-pour-avoir-participe-a-une-manifestation-pro-Ouattara-257425/)
journalist, it was an accident:

> Une source militaire a confirmé la fusillade en expliquant qu'il s'agissait
> d'un accident justifié par la «nervosité des forces de sécurité à la suite
> de précédents accrochages»

A military source confirmed the gunfire explaining that it xas an accident
justified by the “nervosity of Forces of Security following previous clashes”

Another version of the facts was shared on Laurent Gbagbo's [fan
page](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150149670062037) on social
network Facebook. According to this interpretation, these women were killed by
rebels loyal to Prime Minister Guillaume Soro's Forces Nouvelles (New Forces),
who in turn are loyal to President Ouattara:

> Des femmes de la commune d’Abobo qui ont décidé de marcher hier (3 mars
> 2011) matin, ont essuyé des tirs des éléments de la rébellion de ladite
> commune.

Women of Abobo who decided to march yesterday (March 3, 2011) in the morning,
were shot by rebellious elements.

Today, _Notre Voie_ , one of the main daily newspapers in Côte d'Ivoire,
accused the mysterious ‘[Invisible
Commandos](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704692904576166532126828052.html)‘
– a group of pro-Ouattara masked men – of the killings. In an unequivocal
frontpage headline, the newspaper writes: ‘”The Invisible Commandos” Kill
Seven Women’.

    Notre Voie N° 3822 du Friday mars 04 2011

The same denial has been aired on the national television station RTI: Côte
d'Ivoire army spokeperson, Colonel Major Hilaire Babri Gohourou [has
said](http://news.abidjan.net/h/393199.html?n=393199) [fr]:

[ ](http://news.abidjan.net/h/393199.html?n=393199)

the troops were confined in their headquater in Abobo

[fr], a web television station reputed to belong to one of Laurent Gbagbo's
daughters, [Marie Patrice Gbagbo](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariegbagbo),
maintains this version:

> Des femmes qui marchaient pacifiquement ont essuyé des tirs de cette force
> négative [le commando invisible ndlr] qui ont fait une diziane de morts. Cet
> acte s’est déroulé dans la commune d’Abobo où est logé la rébellion
> d’Alassane Ouattara qui tue et égorge les paisibles populations.

Women who were marching peacefully were shot by this dark force [the
‘Invisible Commandos’] who killed dozens of people. This happened in Abobo
where Alassane's Ouattara rebellion is headquartered, killing and cutting the
throats of peaceful people.
