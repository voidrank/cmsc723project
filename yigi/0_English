International Women's Day 2011 will be remembered in Cameroon for more
technological reasons.

Bouba Kaele, a marketing manager at the South African MTN telecom company in
Cameroon, announced on social network Twitter that the [Cameroonian Government
banned access to twitter via SMS for MTN
customers](http://twitter.com/#!/bubakaele/status/45065974164111360) [fr] :

For security reasons, the Cameroonian Government asked that posting on twitter
via SMS be suspended on the MTN Cameroon network

According to Edouard Tamba on his [blog](http://edouardtamba.com/?p=2075),
customers received information via SMS from the MTN Cameroon saying [fr]:

> Cher client, pour des raisons indépendantes de notre volonté, l’accès au
> 8711 est désormais suspendu. Merci de votre compréhension

Dear costumer, for reasons we cannot control, access to 8711 has been shut
down. Thank you for your understanding.

Contacted on Twitter about the reasons for the ban, MTN's the Chief
Information Officer,

This news caused anger among the Cameroonian online community. A hashtag was
immediately created by

Guys I suggest the hashtag #SMSTweet to chat about this suspension affair,
because soon, websites will follow! #cmr11

These netizens’ surprise is understandable: after all on March 5 2011, the
[9ideas conference](http://www.9ideasconference.com/concept.html) was
organised in Douala, Cameroon. The technology-driven conference was sponsored,
by MTN, among others and the floor was given to African and Cameroonian
innovators for them to introduce their ideas aimed at helping to develop the
continent. The subject of Internet censorship had been dealt with at this
occasion; as

explains:

We talked about internet censorship (…) at the 9ideas [conference], it came a
bit too early according to me #fail #govt

Cameroonian online portal Mboablog posted on its
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/MboaBLOG) channel a video of the 9ideas
conference:

[@mambenanje](http://twitter.com/#!/mambenanje/status/45082308335771649) is
more than upset:

[@etumnamboa](http://twitter.com/#!/etumnamboa/status/45097031957610496) is
even more sour:

Why suspend the #SMSTweet? It represents little in terms of traffic ! What
security are we talking about here? #Theyjustdontgetit #cmr11

For many, “security reasons” mentioned by the authorities are related to the
recent revolutions and uprisings that have taken place throughout Africa since
the beginning of the year. This unrest also affected Cameroon, though to a
lesser extent than its African counterparts, on [February 23,
2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/02/cameroon-the-will-for-change-
interview-with-kah-walla-audio/). It's the opinion shared by
[@mambenanje](http://twitter.com/#!/mambenanje/status/45201308155772928):

[![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

But according to blogger [Dibussi
Tande](http://www.dibussi.com/2011/03/cameroon-bans-twitter-via-sms.html), the
Cameroonian Government got it all wrong:

> Obviously, the government has failed to learn the lesson from North Africa.
> (…) It was information obtained via mobile phones, regular SMS and email
> which ended up on Twitter and not real-time tweets from activists on the
> ground. Thus, banning the Twitter short code does little to change the
> balance of power online.

Cameroonian netizens seem nevertheless resourceful. Blogger [Djia
Think](http://networkedblogs.com/famQL) posted an article on “OpenMesh, the
ultimate weapon to keep our freedom of communication” that introduces the
[OpenMesh project](http://www.openmeshproject.org/):

> C’est dans l’optique de lutter contre ses coups portés à la liberté de
> communication que Shervin Pishevar proposait le 27 Février 2011, le projet
> OpenMesh qui consiste à former un réseau maillée, où les hommes joueront le
> rôle des routeurs Internet

It is with the fight for freedom of communication in mind that Shervin
Pishevar proposed on February 27, 2011 the OpenMesh project, which consists in
forming a meshed network, where people will be the Internet routers.
