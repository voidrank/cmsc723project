Doolittle album cover (1989) Pixies

In the wake of mounting international criticism and condemnation of Israel’s
clash with activists intent on breaking the blockade on Gaza, the Pixies, a
veteran rock band, have [canceled their concert
](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3899548,00.html)in Israel. This
comes hot on the heels of performance cancellations by the [Klaxons, Gorillaz
Sound System](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/pixies-cancel-israel-
concert-1.294451) as well as [Elvis
Costello](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h7csdWuPpv1gUvtvtDfcLcmv_xqwD9FQHVT80).
However, it was news of the Pixies no show that hotted up the Twitosphere and
got many finding the link between music and politics.

The Pixies did not specify the reason behind the last minute cancellatio.
[Shuki Weiss](http://twitter.com/shukiweiss), the band’s Tel Aviv promoter,
released this statement:

> [בצער רב אנו מודיעים היום על החלטת הפיקסיז לבטל הופעתם בישראל  
>  It is with great regret that we announce today The Pixies’ decision to
> cancel their appearance](http://twitter.com/shukiweiss)

This sparked mixed reactions and brought both pro and anti Israel sentiment to
the fore.  
There were those, like [@ismpalestine](http://twitter.com/ismpalestine), who
thanked the Pixies for not supporting an apartheid state:

> [  
>  Pixies cancel Israel show. Thank @Pixies for rejecting apartheid! #flotilla
> #israel #pixies](http://twitter.com/ismpalestine/status/15556414442)

Others, like [@SMaher85](http://twitter.com/SMaher85), commended the Pixies
for upholding justice and promoting peace:

> [Another victory for #BDS! #Pixies cancel #Israel concert! Thank you for
> standing with justice & peace: http://bit.ly/aXJvea
> #Palestine](http://twitter.com/SMaher85/statuses/15562419011)

From Israeli Pixie fans, there were strong, vitriolic reactions with some
using the band’s own lyrics to make a point. [@Dachniella
](http://twitter.com/Dachniella)asked :

> [  
>  where is your mind, pixies? why mix art and politics???
> #pixiessuck](http://twitter.com/Dachniella/status/15543069023)

Many fans, like [@OrTheDude,](http://twitter.com/OrTheDude) also accused the
band of having a weak understanding of the Israel’s political situation:

> [The #Pixies are COWARDLY yielding to biased politics, shame on you for not
> getting to the bottom of things! #pixiessuck #israel
> #music](http://twitter.com/OrTheDude/status/15543253290)

[@photomiky ](http://twitter.com/photomiky)added :

> [Pixies do-little to understand Israel's security needs.
> #pixiessuck](http://twitter.com/photomiky/status/15543551865)

But it’s not just on Twitter that people have been reacting. The [Pixie’s
Facebook fan
page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/PIXIES/22939707441?ref=search) was
bombarded with fan’s comments about the cancellation. At the time of writing,
there were [242
comments](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150194328455650&comments),
most of them in response to the bands decision not to play in Tel Aviv. These
comments give interesting insight into a conflict that is older than the
Pixies and far darker than their lyrics could ever be.  
Some like Riky Cohen, accuse the band of being anti-Semitic, terrorist
collaborators:

> Hypocrisy, hypocrisy and disgusting. Will you stop running in countries like
> America, England, and others who fought in Iraq? You are collaborators with
> an anti-Semitic terrorist

But there are also comments on the Facebook fan page, like those by like
Pamela Hardyment, which applaud the Pixie’s decision:

> LOVE YOU, THANKS FOR AVOIDING THE SCUM OF THE EARTH IN ISRAEHELL

Elton John and Rod Stewart are still scheduled to play in Israel this summer.
There is, however, pressure on the artists to reconsider and cancel. On
Twitter, [@bataleh](http://twitter.com/bataleh) writes:

> [4gt itRT @DiamantChehadeh: EltonJohn,im sure Israel wl roll u out redcarpet
> covered in innocent blood.Do it Cancel your show
> #Flotilla](http://twitter.com/bataleh/status/15123222357)

Another Twitter user, [@DANALTWEETS](http://twitter.com/DANALTWEETS), also
advocates that artists not play in Israel :

> [snoop dogg,klaxons,gorillaz,santana, and elvis costello have all cancelled
> concerts in israel, finally, whose next? #bds #flotilla
> #freepali](http://twitter.com/DANALTWEETS/status/15446901530)
