Another year has passed since the 1994 ceasefire put the war between Armenia
and Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh on hold, but a lasting peace remains
elusive. However, both countries continue to accuse the other of destroying
cultural and historical monuments.

But, while the issue of the destruction of an ancient Armenian cemetery in the
exclave of Nakhichevan is [frequently
raised](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/15/azerbaijan-destruction-of-
ancient-cemetery-commemorated/), less is known about the cultural loss
suffered by Azerbaijan. _Gələcək Gün_ [AZ] [details some of the
destruction](http://mesih.azeriblog.com/2007/12/15/nigar-sultanli-azerbaycan-
medeniyyeti-ermeni-esaretinde).

> In Shusha alone, 8 museums, 31 libraries, and 8 cultural houses were
> destroyed. More than 300 items at the Hajibayov museum, 400 at the Bulbul
> Museum, 100 from Navvab, 2,000 from the Agdam museum, 3,000 from the Gubadli
> history museum, 6,000 from the Zengilan museum as well as 1,000 exhibits
> from the Karabakh History and Carpet museums were destroyed or sent to
> Armenia.

_ƏN SON XƏBƏRLƏR, MƏQALƏLƏR_ [AZ] [provides its readers with a
list](http://eyvaz.azeriblog.com/2008/05/08/xeber-2-17) of Azerbaijani
soldiers captured by Armenians during the war who were forced to participate
in the destruction of monuments and graveyards in Shusha.

> Mammadov Vugar […]: We were forced to destroy the Muslim graveyards,
> carrying [stone] by car to sell. All Muslim graveyards were destroyed. They
> wanted to destroy Shusha.
>
> Kazimov Karim […]: Along with other captured soldiers, I was forced to
> destroy Ibrahim Khan's grave, Molla Vagifs graves […] and the Bulbuls and
> Hajibayov monuments and graveyards.
>
> Gafarov Rauf: All the graveyards are destroyed. Probably they intended to
> take the gold teeth from the dead. They also put a church sign on the
> mosque.
>
> Bagirov Sahib […]: The materials from the destruction were used to build a
> house for Samvel Babayan [ _formely imprisoned Karabakh Armenian military
> leader_ ].
>
> Mehdiyev Nazim: The materials were used to make a monument for [ _Armenian_
> ] General Andranik. In her interview to the _Azartamartik_ newspaper,
> Nagorno Karabakh's Cultural Ministry Department Director, Janna Aleksanyan,
> said “we will destroy all the monuments belonging to Azerbaijanis during
> their occupation of Shusha.”

_Salam, Xoş Gəlmisiniz_ [AZ} also comments on archeological digs conducted in
the [Azix cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azykh), one of the earliest
proto-human habitations in the region. The blog [notes that the site is
situated on Azerbaijan's
territory](http://elvusal.azeriblog.com/2008/06/25/ermenistan-azerbaycan-
daghliq-qarabagh-munaqishesi-neticesinde-azerbaycan-medeniyyetine-deymish-
maddi-ve-menevi-ziyan-haqqinda-qisa-arayish).

> “In 2003, on the _Arminfo_ news site it was written that “archeological
> diggings continue in the Azix Cave.” It is one of the most ancient findings
> in Azerbaijan that dates back 1.5 million years. Armenians digging with
> other country scientists from Britain, Ireland and Spain violate national
> and international law with their unauthorized excavation.”

A _Facebook_ page [has been set
up](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=26352990373) to protest the work
while the Council of Europe's Secretary General, Terry Davis, visited the
capitals of both countries in December 2008. However, an international mission
to investigate the state of historical and cultural monuments in the region
has been delayed.

“ _I am very disappointed by the losses_ ,” Davis is reported as saying. “
_Both Azerbaijan and Armenia suffered, and it is not only yours, [but also
European] cultural heritage. […] They are our common values and we should
protect them._ “
