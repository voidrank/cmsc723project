Bab Berdieyinne Minaret, Meknes Morocco (photo by Eli J. T.)

On February 19, devastating news from Morocco: the minaret of the Bab
Berdieyinne Mosque (also known as the Lalla Khenata bint Bekkar Mosque) in the
[UNESCO heritage](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/793) city of Meknès, Morocco
(where I lived from 2005-2007) had collapsed during Friday prayers. The
initial death toll was reported as 11, but by the following Saturday, CNN had
[reported](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/02/19/morocco.minaret.collapse/)
it as 36, with an additional 71 injured. The collapse was reported to have
occurred due to recent heavy rains which weakened the structure of the
minaret.

Bloggers are sharing local stories and condolences with the people of Meknès.
MontanaRon, who taught English in the city,
[writes](http://montanaron.com/wordpress/2010/02/22/moroccan-mosque/):

**Local Neglect?**

Moroccan news blog _Morocco Post_ is one of several bloggers who finds the
circumstances surrounding the minaret's collapse neglectful. Drawing a
comparison between the accident and a recent case in England of canine
neglect, [the blogger
writes](http://www.moroccopost.net/politics/4594-morocco-the-suspect-of-the-
meknes-disaster-has-been-named/):

> For instance, on Monday 22 February 2010, a police officer in England was
> given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,500 costs for
> a criminal offence that he committed last year. PC Mark Johnson was found
> guilty of the death of 18-month-old Jay-Jay and seven Jet, who were in the
> back of a police vehicle during a heat wave in June last year…
>
> …
>
> …So broaden your imagination and juxtapose the two disasters: 41 human
> beings died after a mosque minaret collapse on them and no one is to assume
> responsibility as the rain was the cause, whereas 2 dogs died of heatstroke
> and the police officer in charge was brought to justice.
>
> Now the question is: who are the dogs and who are the human beings?

**Life Goes On**

_Morocco Time_ [reports](http://liosliath.com/blog/2010/02/22/meknes-minaret-
offers-of-sympathyassistance/) that a number of foreign governments have
offered their condolences to the people of Morocco.
