Yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of the murder of 26-year old Gurgen
Margarian, an Armenian officer attending a NATO Partnership for Peace program
in Budapest, Hungary. Killed in his sleep with an axe wielded by his
Azerbaijani counterpart, Ramil Safarov, Margarian is commemorated by special
posts made by some Armenian bloggers.

2009 commemoration in Yerevan, Armenia_

Considered a hero by many in Azerbaijan because of the bitter war over the
disputed region of Nagorno Karabakh, many Armenians instead argue that
Safarov's act proves the two peoples can never live side by side again.
Posting a commemorative banner with Margarian’s face, _Noni-no_ [reflects on
the incident](http://noni-no.livejournal.com/137378.html).

the killer into a hero.

Today Ramil Safarov sits in life-term in Budapest…. In his homeland, he has
successfully made himself to the rank of a national hero for having killed an
Armenian. A search of “Ramil Safarov” brings a huge number of [Azerbaijani]
sites and YouTube videos calling for [Safarov’s] release or repatriation to
[Azerbaijan’s capital] Baku, where he would naturally be immediately set free
[….]

Although some prominent Azeris spoke out against attempts to glorify Safarov,
and while the authorities in Baku did disperse and prevent small rallies in
his support, _Kevork_ [quotes from some of those who
didn't](http://kevork.livejournal.com/45375.html).
