Three years after a cemetery dating back to the 9th Century was [deliberately
destroyed](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article707673.ece)
in the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichevan, bloggers recall an ancient culture
annihilated and condemn the world for closing its eyes to what many consider
to be an official attempt to rewrite history.

_NoThingfjord_ , a Turkish blog,
[writes](http://nothingfjord.blogspot.com/2008/12/djulfa.html):

> Today is the commemoration of the 3rd anniversary of Djulfa's destruction.
> …This [is] not only a crime against Armenian culture, but against our
> collective cultural heritage as humankind. Don't let it go unnoticed.

Between 10-16 December 2005 over a hundred uniformed men were videotaped
destroying the Djulfa cemetery using sledgehammers, cranes, and trucks. The
video was taken from across the border in Iran.

More than just a loss to global culture, _Ivan Kondratiev_ [RU] says that
Djulfa's destruction was meant to [change the story of Nakhichevan's
indigenous heritage](http://1970-e.livejournal.com/98135.html).

> Азербайджанские власти на протяжении всего советского периода старались

> протяжении веков, вопреки тому, что говорилось в азербайджанских советских
> мифах о собственной “древности”… Это кладбище, вполне достойное названия

The Azeri authorities throughout all Soviet period tried to destroy this
necropolis as for them it was only a testament that Armenians were owners of
this territory throughout centuries in spite of Azerbaijan's Soviet myths
about own “antiquity”… This cemetery, quite worthy to be called a wonder, was
not even placed on the register of architectural monuments of Azerbaijan…
After USSR's collapse, during the Karabakh conflict, the cemetery's demolition
continued, and, at last, definitively destroyed….

An Iranian blogger also argues that Djulfa was [undesirable evidence of an
inconvenient past](http://irannational.blogspot.com/2008/04/blog-post.html).

> آنان از سنگ قبر ارامنه هم نگذشته اند و با تخریب دوازده هزار قبر با سنگ قبر
> هایی منحصر به فرد که متعلق به چند قرن پیش بوده و جزئی از میراث فرهنگی ارامنه
> به حساب می آمد، هیچ اثری از ارمنی نشین بودن آنجا، بجا نگذاشته اند.

[After acquiring Nakhichevan, Azeris] did not even tolerate Armenian
gravestones. They destroyed twelve thousand Armenian graves. These unique
gravestones with several centuries’ history were part of Armenian cultural
heritage. However, through destruction of these gravestones, [Azeris]
destroyed all signs indicating the existence of Armenians in that land.

_iArarat_ , [remembers
Djulfa](http://iararat.wordpress.com/2008/12/11/remembering-jugha/) by
discussing Robert Bevan’s _The Destruction of Memory: Architecture at War_ , a
book that was “part of a class I teach at a Texas university on nationalism
and ethno-political conflicts.”

> […]

> While reading Bevan’s book I was inevitably reminded of the destruction of

_The Stiletto_ , an award-winning blog [posts a well-researched account of
Djulfa's destruction](http://thestilettoblog.com/2008/12/13/goody-two-shoes-
azerbaijan-demolishes-priceless-medieval-christian-monuments-and-western-
nations-yawn.aspx) and attempts by Azerbaijan to deny it ever existed.

> Adding insult to injury, earlier this month Baku, Azerbaijan hosted a

> discuss “Intercultural dialogue as the basis for peace and sustainable
> development in Europe and its neighboring regions.” In his opening remarks

> “Azerbaijan has rich history and the cultural monuments here are duly
> preserved, and a lot is being done in this direction…”

Meanwhile, _nrbakert_tashuk_ [Ru] [asks whether one should laugh or
cry](http://nrbakert-tashuk.livejournal.com/40878.html ) at attempts to
represent other indigenous Armenian monuments as Turkish or Azerbaijani.
However, _Kornelij_ [RU] [says Armenia is also to
blame](http://kornelij.livejournal.com/479827.html) for not participating in a
conference held early this month in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku.

_Unzipped_ [agrees](http://unzipped.blogspot.com/2008/12/djulfa-jugha-
destruction-3rd.html).

_[old-dilettante](http://old-dilettante.livejournal.com/ )_ [RU], says that
Djulfa's destruction was the last stage of Azerbaijan's attempt to eradicate
Nakhichevan's Armenian heritage. Commenting on a post about churches in
Georgia, [she
writes](http://drugoi.livejournal.com/2777926.html?thread=165605958#t165605958):

> Теперь там не найдется ни одной армянской церкви, несмотря на фотографии и

> И кто через 20 лет скажет, что там вообще жили армяне? … А ведь мой дед был

…Now, not a single Armenian church will be found [in Nakhichevan] despite of
photographs, some as recent as 20-years-old. All churches are annihilated. All
cemeteries. All khatchkars.
