Cartoon published in Gulf Times Nov. 22 2009

Is it satire, or just bad taste?

A cartoon of a crazed, angry-looking woman threatening a child with a dripping
bowl of tainted gruel has left many Doha bloggers scratching their heads and
looking for answers.

The sketch, titled ‘Housemaid's revenge,’ was published in Sunday's [_Gulf
Times_](http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/index.asp?cu_no=2&temp_type=44),
a local English newspaper.

The cartoon depicts a maid – presumably Indian, judging by the red bindi on
her forehead and gold hoop earrings – threatening a toddler after being
scolded by her employer.

The text reads:

> Your mum shouted at me today just because I broke a plate. And I am going to
> strike back. Count on me you brat, you won't sleep at home tonight! You will
> stay at Al Sadd Children's Emergency. Open your mouth now. This dish I have
> made will make you so sick that it will make you dizzy for hours.

Many Doha bloggers strongly condemned the cartoon, but were undecided about
the artist's intentions.

Some wondered if the message behind the cartoon was lost in translation.

On _Qatar Living_ , the debate turned to treatment of maids by their
employers, who sponsor their stay in the country.

Satire or not, most found the cartoon to be in poor taste.
