The [_A Nova Corja_ blog](http://www.novacorja.org/) [The New Scum, pt], a
symbol of independent and investigative journalism on the Brazilian
blogosphere, [has published a farewell post](http://www.novacorja.org/?p=5411)
[pt]. On August 6th, the last remaing blogger of the group, Rodrigo Alvares,
announced that he has decided to close the blog down due to professional
commitments and a consequent lack of time to carry on posting as much as he
would like to.

Over the past five years that the blog has been online, _Nova Corja_ stood out
mainly because of its coverage of corruption scandals in the Rio Grande do Sul
Government, accusations that have now led the Federal Public Ministry of that
state to investigate governor [Yeda
Crusius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeda_Crusius) for malpractice and
administrative dishonesty. Nova Corja was also known for its acid, dark sense
of humor and for its [unyielding opposition to
PT](http://laviejabruja.blogspot.com/2009/08/nem-assim-tao-nova.html), the
ruling Labour Party of Brazilian President Lula – although at the same time
the blog was often also accused by its many foes of backing the same party.

The [last post](http://www.novacorja.org/?p=5411) has gathered, at the time of
publication of this piece, nearly 300 comments. According to Alvares, the
blog's archive will still be available online as a testimony of its fight
against corruption:

I hope that **Nova Corja** remains as a logbook of the dementia ravaging not
only the Yeda government, but Rio Grande do Sul and Brazilian politics. Next
year's elections will be the most important since 1989, and [posts about] much
of the recent fuckup [our politicians] have caused can be found in the blog
archives.
