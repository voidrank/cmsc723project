fighting](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/10/dr-congo-fighting-
continues/) in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to take
its toll on women's health.

Throughout the conflict women have been brutalized by [rape and sexual
violence]( https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/10/drc-human-rights-and-
gender-violence-in-north-kivu/). An estimated [200,000 women and
girls](http://www.unfpa.org/public/cache/offonce/News/pid/2181) have been
assaulted over the past 12 years, with more than 18,000 cases reported between
January and September 2008. This past May, the U.S. Senate foreign relations
committee held a [hearing](http://www.enoughproject.org/blogs/expert-
officials-activists-press-us-senate-address-rape-weapon-war) to address how
rape is being used as a weapon of war in the DRC.

Often this rape takes on extremely violent forms and can cause injuries to a
woman's reproductive organs. For instance, it can cause a health condition
called vaginal fistula, which happens when the wall between a woman's vagina
and the bladder and/or rectum tears. Also called traumatic fistula when caused
by sexual violence, it's hard to know how many women in the DRC have this
condition. But it's been estimated that
[thousands](http://www.rhrc.org/rhr%5Fbasics/gbv.html#) of Congolese girls and
women have been impacted, and one
[assessment](http://www.unfpa.org/16days/documents/pl_traumaticfistula.doc) of
six DRC provinces found that out of 432 fistula cases, around14 percent were
because of trauma.

Jim Bliss, blogging on _The Quiet Road_ , elaborates on the situation. He
[says]( http://numero57.net/?p=131):

> “In the rest of the world the condition [fistula] generally occurs due to
> serious complications during childbirth. Most gynecologists and
> obstetricians will go their entire career without ever encountering a single
> case. In DRC, however, there’s an epidemic. And it’s not down to an increase
> in complicated births.

> Many of the militias in DRC have adopted a deliberate policy of terror
> through mass rape…However rape – even violent rape – does not as a rule
> cause fistula. No, instead the militiamen, having already gang-raped the
> woman (often a huge number of times over a period of weeks or months) will
> deliberately inflict major damage to her genitals before sending her back to
> her village. More often than not this is achieved by carefully shooting the
> woman’s vagina at point-blank range…Knives, broken glass or just sharp
> sticks are [also] used to cause as much damage as possible. Girls as young
> as 12 months have been subjected to this violence.”

Medical complications for women with fistula can include being permanently
incontinent, infertility, miscarriages, and other health problems. On top of
this, women with fistula often face [
stigma](http://www.unfpa.org/16days/documents/pl_traumaticfistula.doc) because
of their status as a rape victim, as well as their chronic incontinence.

Many wounded women are unable to get treatment, but there are some medical
centers that treat rape-related injuries, including fistula. One such center
is the Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, which was created in 1999. Surgeons at the
hospital performed [540 fistula
repairs](http://www.unfpa.org/16days/documents/pl_traumaticfistula.doc) in
2005, 80 percent of which were due to sexual violence. In this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnH-9jcmHbY), a psychologist at the
Panzi Hospital shows what life is like for women seeking treatment for
traumatic fistula.

Endre Vestvik visited the hospital and took a [series of
photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/endrevestvik/sets/72157604317841811/) of
women and girls being treated for fistula. This is a

of 4-year-old Vitonsi, who is preparing for fistula surgery. She was raped by
soldiers when trying to cross the river with her pregnant mom and her sister.

_Gypsy Girl Chronicles_ also went to Panzi Hospital and [describes](
http://gypsygirlchronicles.blogspot.com/2007/02/drc-journal-entry-2.html) her
experience:

> “Doctors here specialize in fistula operation and women travel here from far
> and wide for a cure. I met one woman here who was raped and tortured at the
> age of 17 during the height of the war. She has been at the hospital, away
> from her family for over 6 years now enduring one operation after another.
> She said that she did not feel human anymore and had no future.”

A hospital in Goma is also working to treat women who have fistula. This video
shows a young woman with the condition being taken to the DOCS Hospital, where
other women are recovering from treatment.

Despite the positive work being done by these hospitals, Emin Pasha, blogging
on _Congo Resources_ , felt [highly
discouraged](http://www.congoresources.com/2009/01/sexual-violence-in-drc-
what-do-we-know.html) after learning more about sexual violence in the DRC.

> “Little is being done about the problem, despite the fact that rape in
> eastern Congo has become such a well-known and well-publicized problem.
> Research on the topic remains preliminary; there are still only a handful of
> clinics and hospitals addressing the needs of the women; police and local
> authorities still don't have any capacity or willingness to protect the
> population; and overall it appears that the problem is getting worse not
> better.”

Still, Brad MacIntosh, blogging on _A wide-angle view of the DRC conflict_ ,
[says](http://saferworld.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/bukavu-july-2009/) his visit
to the Panzi Hospital in June gave him a glimmer of hope.

> “It is hard to describe all the emotions as I walked through the open
> corridors of the hospital complex on a warm and sunny day. I headed towards
> the operating theatres and found that the second building is now fully
> operational. This operating theater is for surgical repair of women who have
> survived rape. Surgeries are performed by the head fistula surgeon, a gentle
> and wise doctor named Dr Yunga who I met previously. Beyond this building is
> a beautiful courtyard where survivors of rape have a place to call their
> own, where they have workshops, sing, cook and learn skills…I have seen
> evidence of remarkable progress at Panzi Hospital. Layers of progress in
> fact, which leads me to conclude it is a place of immense potential and
> optimism in city that has seen too much despair.”
