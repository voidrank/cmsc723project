India is the world's second most populous country with a population of 1.2
billion people and 70% of its population lives in the villages. Over [456
million Indians ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_India) (42% of the
population) fall below the international poverty line of $1.25 a day. Although
the the agricultural sector accounts for 28% of GDP, a significant portion of
the population are involved in this sector either as farmers or in support
services. However an epidemic has hit the Indian farmers. Increasingly farmers
are resorting to extreme measures like [taking their own
lives](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/1500-farmers-commit-mass-
suicide-in-india-1669018.html) en masse to bail out of pressures of
indebtedness and poverty and this has been happening [year after
year](http://www.celsias.com/article/how-gm-seeds-killed-more-indians-world-
war-ii/).

_Devinder Sharma_ , an India based food and trade policy analyst who blogs at
_Ground Reality_ , [informs](http://devinder-
sharma.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-know-now-why-farmers-kill-themselves.html):

And why are these farmers committing suicide? Freelance journalist _Nita J.
Kulkarni_ explains in her blog _[A Wide Angle View of
India](http://nitawriter.wordpress.com/2007/05/14/why-indians-commit-suicide/
)_ :

> Farmers fell into debt because of a combination of high farming costs –
> exorbitantly priced hybrid (so-called high yielding) seeds and pesticides
> sold by multinationals and a lack of a good price for their produce, partly
> due to imports. Drought added to their woes. Irrigation was too expensive
> for these farmers and the state government didn’t help.

Indian blogger _S Gupta_
[slams](http://ceospeaks.mrkconsultancy.com/2009/08/large-part-of-india-
drought-hit-but-no.html) the ineffectiveness of the government relief systems.

_[Sonia Faleiro](http://www.soniafaleiro.com/)_ , an award-winning journalist
and writer from India [
explains](http://soniafaleiro.blogspot.com/2005/12/death-along-famished-
road.html) how the cotton farmers in Vidarbha region of the Maharashtra state
are stuck into this quicksand of debt without the help from the State.

> One diseased crop or the misguided purchase of spurious seeds, for example,
> necessitates a loan. Only five percent of farmers are eligible for loans
> from cooperatives and banks, usually because of a previous default. The
> remainder are forced into the grip of private, often hostile moneylenders
> who extract approximately Rs 500 interest every four months on every Rs
> 1,000 borrowed.
