Konaté](https://fr.globalvoicesonline.org/author/konate-boukary/), 31, teaches
French and English in a high school in
[Bamako](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamako), the capital of
[Mali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali).

Fate, and hard work, brought him from rural Mali to Bamako, where he
discovered and fell in love with the World Wide Web.

Joining the translators team at [_Global Voices in
French_](https://fr.globalvoicesonline.org) has steered him onto a new path.
He is now involved in multiple projects to promote his native language,
[Bambara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambara_language), on the Web, and to
bring more Internet access to rural Mali.

If you are on the iPhone and ‘information overload’ side of the digital
divide, you will appreciate that Boukary has a sobering, inspiring, and even
magical story to tell in this interview.

**Q: How did you discover _Global Voices in French_ and decide to join as a
translator?**

> It happened in December '08.
>
> One day, around 8 PM, I was sitting alone in my room in Bamako when I was
> seized by the wish to learn more. The following words formed in my mind: “I
> want.” These are powerful words for me.
>
> I got up, went to the cyber café, booked a computer and typed, “I want” in
> the Google search bar. I browsed the results and found [Global Voices en
> français](https://fr.globalvoicesonline.org/).
>
> The next day, I enrolled as a volunteer translator.

**Q: Your native village,** **Sanogola-Bamoussobougou, has no electricity,
much less an Internet connection. Please tell us a bit about your life.**

> I am the son of Négué, a farmer, and Djènèba Kané, a housewife. I grew up on
> a farm, helping my parents. One evening, I was shepherding cows with other
> kids when we met a man on the road, a sergeant. His Suzuki motorcycle was
> broken. His name was Lassinè Traoré.
>
> While we helped him, he asked if I went to school. I said “No”. He went to
> see my father and advised him to send me to school. For weeks, he came back,
> until my father gave his consent. Sergeant Traoré told me, “There I leave
> you. You now have the duty to do well at school to honor me, and later to
> take care of yourself and your parents.”
>
> I walked six kilometers to the nearest school for years until I moved to
> Bamako to attend high school. I did bricklayer work and odd jobs on week-
> ends to make ends meet with my state grant. My mother wanted me to succeed
> in school, she did everything in her power.
>
> I went on to teachers’ school. I would have liked to go to university, but I
> don't have the means for that. So I trained myself to use a computer and
> surf from cyber cafés in Bamako. The Web soothed my thirst for knowledge.
