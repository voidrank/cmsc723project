_HIV Information for Myanmar_ (HIM) has written [an
article](http://him.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2009/8/22/4296744.html)
regarding the recent change of policy in the formation of informally named
groups of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) Network.

The author attached [a
letter](http://him.civiblog.org/_attachments/4296744/the%20letter.jpg) from
Deputy Director-General of Disease Control Unit under the Ministry of Health
addressing to Head Doctors under the Prevention and Control Team for Sexually
Transmitted Diseases and HIV.

> PLHIV Networks are being formed in different States and Divisions in order
> to help with the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. In doing these tasks,
> it is necessary for PLHIV Network Group to work under the supervision of
> Prevention and Control Team for STDs and HIV, and thus, does not need to
> carry a separate name. If the Group wants to operate under a separate name,
> **it will need to register step-by-step at the Township, Province, and
> State/Division Peace & Development Councils, and the Ministry of Home
> Affairs**, in accordance with the laws of forming an organization.

explaining about the health situations in Myanmar. He also wrote about the
condition of HIV patients in Myanmar:

Some are worried that the new government policy of requiring HIV groups to
register could be used to “control” or undermine the independence of volunteer
groups in Myanmar. Another reader also voiced his concern in his
[comment](http://him.civiblog.org/blog/_archives/2009/9/1/4306891.html)
regarding the challenges faced by NGOs after the Saffron Revolution in 2007.

According to a [press
release](http://doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=3200) from
Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres) in November 25, 2008, an
estimated 240,000 people are thought to be living with HIV/AIDS in Myanmar.
Among them, 76,000 are in urgent need of anti-retro-viral treatment, yet less
than 20 percent of them are currently able to access it.
