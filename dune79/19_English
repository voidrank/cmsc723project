Last week, the Moroccan blogosphere was [up in
arms](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/08/02/morocco-im-a-9-per-cent/) over
the government's decision to seize two popular magazines – French _TelQuel_
and its Arabic sister publication _Nichane_ – for publishing a poll in which
ordinary Moroccans were asked to give their assessment of the monarch, King
Mohammed VI, despite results which stated 91% of Moroccans approve of his
first ten years of rule.

A campaign, entitled “Je Suis Un 9%” (“I am a 9%”) was quickly created to
represent those who were angered by the decision to censor the results. For
the past week, the Twittoma (Moroccan Twitter community) has been using the
hashtag
[#9pcMaroc](http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=3213533811&page=3&q=%239pcMaroc)
to discuss the incident (highlighted in [this
piece](http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090806/FOREIGN/708059904/1011/NEWS)
in UAE's _The National_ ), while the blogosphere continues to ruminate on it.
One new development, the banning of French paper _Le Monde_ (which also
publicized the results) has some bloggers fuming. _Rachid Jankari_
[writes](http://www.jankari.org/je-suis-du-9/):

I think this ban and the argument for it is a real step backwards. And because
it is a new recognition of the “sacredness” of the King. By invoking this
archaic argument, I think the future of the debate on the present and the
future of the country is once again compromised.

Moroccan blogger _Larbi_ , recognizing the power of the Internet, [published
the poll results](http://www.larbi.org/post/2009/08/Le-Sondage-Interdit?pub=1)
on his blog, noting the near-impossibility of keeping them out of public view:

> Finalement c’est l’AFP qui a eu la primeur de publier le Sondage Interdit,
> en détail avec tous les chiffres. Dépêche qui sera reproduite par tous les
> médias du monde. Maintenant à moins d’interdire tous les médias du monde les
> censeurs sont très mal barrés.

Finally, it is the AFP which was the first to publish the prohibited survey in
detail with all the figures. The dispatch is to be reproduced by media all
around the world. Now, unless you ban all the world's media, the censors are
in trouble.

Blogger _Ibn Kafka_ also republished the results, as well as the _Le Monde_
article, encouraging other Moroccan bloggers to do the same. Commenter
_Kaouthar Lbiati_ responded:

> La position des autorités marocaines (ministère de la communication) est

The position of the Moroccan authorities (Ministry of Communications) is once
again disappointing. Of course the Moroccan people, like all people, moreover,
have the right to evaluate their monarchy to which they have been bound by
allegiance for several centuries now. The Moroccan people want to speak,
explain, be heard and take control of their destinies. Finally, stop the
oppression!

To sum up, the Moroccan blogger behind _Réflexions et autres idées_ states:

> Il faut voir plus loin que son nez. Que sera le Maroc dans 5, 10, 20 ou 50
> ans ? C'est à quoi le gouvernement et le pouvoir doivent travailler et non à

We must look beyond our noses. Where will Morocco be in 5, 10, 20, or 50
years? This is what the government and people in power must work on this
rather than issuing Fatwas (religious edicts) on newspapers and books…
