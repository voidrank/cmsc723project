Every August 16 in the Dominican Republic, as is customary on the date when a
government completes another year in power, President Leonel Fernández
introduces changes in his cabinet. The majority of these changes were not
major this year, but one exception brought about varied reactions. The
executive vice-president of the [Dominican Corporation of State Electric
Companies [es]](http://cdeee.gov.do/) (CDEEE for its initials in Spanish),
Engineer Radhamés Segura was replaced by a well-known figure in the private
sector, businessman Celso Marranzini. In the blog _Duarte 101 [es]_ , Joan
Guerrero [ writes about the new
member](http://duarte101.com/2009/08/18/remeneando-cdeee):

> Celso llegó. Como un invitado inesperado, dejó reacciones en todos los
> medios con su nueva posición, adjudicada por el presidente Fernández.

Celso has arrived. Like an unexpected guest, he caused reactions in all of the
media about his new position, placed there by President Fernández.

[Power outages are a daily reality across the Dominican
Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_the_Dominican_Republic),
and is often said to be one of the main obstacles in its development plans. In
addition, the government has also been providing large subsidies in the energy
sector. These blackouts have been occurring for more than 40 years, and there
have been all kinds of attempts to resolve the situation. To date, none of
these attempts have been successful. Many people are left wondering whether
the naming of Marranzini will change things for the better.

Many believe that there was little doubt that Segura would be out when the
time came for Fernández to announce the changes in his cabinet. Based on the
fact that the rate per kilowatt for electric power [remains one of the highest
in the
region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_the_Dominican_Republic#Tariffs)
and the allegations of corruption and nepotism, Segura's days were numbered.
When the change did happen, few expected for Segura to be substituted by one
of his biggest critics, Marranzini, who in recent weeks made a series of
statements on behalf of the private sector that blamed the poor administration
and incapacity by Segura's team in solving the blackouts once and for all.

For some, this move from the President had a double purpose: 1.) increase the
credibility of the government, who was seriously affected by the accusations
towards Segura and 2) silence the criticism from the private sector to the
government, especially in regards to energy. Luis José of _Ahí e’ que Prende
[es]_ [take a look at the naming](http://ahiequeprende.com/2009/08/17/jugadas-
con-mala-fe):

What does it mean to place Celso Marranzini as the head of the CDEEE? It was a
play in bad faith, with one where (the government) washes its hands and gives
the dead issue of energy to the one that criticized it the most: the private
sector.

Placing a famous businessman, who has the good faith from the majority of the
sectors, forces the private sector to calm down and shut its mouth, because
now, when they criticize the blackouts they are not exclusively criticizing
any public official, but they are now criticizing Don Celso Marranzin, a
person with a enviable career who receives the respect from many.

The tough part is now Celso Marranzini, who after criticizing Segura so much
and was very harsh against the government, will now need to have a good
administration so that they do not crucify him.

Marranzini's reputation among the general public is mixed yet some are hoping
that he can solve the energy issue. However, others are skeptical and
criticize how he took over the position. Rafael Pérez of _Duarte 101 [es]_ ,[
introduces the “Celso Method” on how to hold a public
position](http://duarte101.com/2009/08/18/humildad-celso-cdeee): intensely
criticize a public official – preferably with reason – until the President
grows tired of it, removes the criticized official, and places the critic in
his place. Marino, a reader of _Ahí e’ que Prende [es]_ [goes a step
further](http://ahiequeprende.com/2009/08/17/jugadas-con-mala-fe/):

> Ahora, Una sola pregunta, supuestamente ya sabemos quien es el Ing. Radhames
> Segura, ahora… quien Conoce al LADRONAZO de Celso Marranzini, que vendia
> energia con su distribuidora ILEGAL, a una suma de 200% mas cara que lo que
> el la Compraba… y ahora es el Titular de la institucion que el y su grupo de
> empresarios tiene QUEBRADO… que carajazo va resolver ese tigre.

Now, just one question, supposedly we already know who is the Engineer
Radhames Segura, now, who knows the THIEF, Celso Marranzini, who sold energy
with his ILLEGAL distribution company at a price of 200% more expensive than
at which he bought it… and now is the Head of the institution that he and his
business group have BANKRUPTED … what will able to solve that tiger
(Marranzini.)

Upon being removed from the CDEEE, President Fernández named Segura as an
governmental adviser in the field of energy. However, he declined the position
and publicly announced that he will dedicate himself to cleaning up his public
image.
