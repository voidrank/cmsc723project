Wildfires broke out on Friday night in Northeast Attica in Greece and rapidly
consumed large tracts of forested land and properties. In just two days, they
reached the northernmost suburbs of Athens, reawakening memories of
[destruction in the nightmarish forest fires of
2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Greek_forest_fires).

Greek blogger _mindstripper_ [posted the view from her
balcony](http://thescratchblog.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/260/) on Saturday
evening on the scratch blog:

Athens time 8pm. And I want to leave home.

A day later, London-based photographer _mlazopoulou_ [posted a photo taken
from an airplane](http://twitter.com/mlazopoulou/statuses/3493319178):

She commented, “Just can't describe this with words…”

**Live views of the fire**

On Sunday night, a [webcam](http://www.snowreport.gr/snowcam/live3/) in the
forest of Schinias recorded snapshots of advancing fires until the camera
temporarily went out of order (it is now working again).

The _New Athenian_ [chronicled the events of early
Sunday](http://www.thenewathenian.com/2009/08/fires-burn-eastern-athens-
suburb-of.html), when the fire reached the Pendeli suburb of Athens:

> Many local residents had spent the night protecting their homes. On Sunday
> morning they were still doing what they could to put out small fires near
> their homes, beating them with olive branches and shovels, or forming human
> chains to relay buckets of water filled using yard hoses. The air was thick
> with acrid smoke, and people were covering their faces with T-shirts,
> kerchiefs and towels to work. [..]
>
> Many Pendeli residents were waiting until the last moment to evacuate their
> houses. The roads were still lined with parked vehicles in late morning.
> Many people were waiting outside their homes, faces covered, their dogs
> beside them on leashes. From the invisible depths of the smoke explosions
> were audible – natural gas tanks, perhaps, or cars exploding.

On Twitter, people referred to a [Google Maps mashup](http://bit.ly/4iAuDm),
with data from the fire information agency
[FIRMS](http://maps.geog.umd.edu/firms/), to monitor the fires and quickly
settled on a hashtag
([#grfires](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23grfires)) to aggregate
tweets related to the fire. Most messages repeated information broadcast on
TV, as well as media and political criticism, with little actual firsthand
reporting.

Twitter user [@savvakos](http://twitter.com/savvakos) provided some firsthand
reports of advancing fire fronts, complete with Google Maps coordinates:

> Ενεργό μέτωπο της φωτιάς στην Σταμάτα, λίγο πριν από την πλατεία
> [#grfires](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23grfires "#grfires")
> <http://bit.ly/t38Z5> <http://twitpic.com/ezarv>

Also on Twitter, @kyanoun [posted a real-time video with
commentary](http://qik.ly/dePc) using Qik from his car while he drove down a
smoke-clouded Attica highway.

**Flickering lights in the dark**

Sunset is a dreaded time during times of fire, because aircraft are grounded
and firefighting efforts are severely hampered. Eric Parks described this
[dramatic moment](http://twitter.com/erictparks/status/3495045056) on Twitter:

> @erictparks: Sunset & we're watching daring air crews make final drops in
> little light. Darkness reveals hundreds of points of fire on the mountains.

Greek web designer [Dimitrios Doukoglou](http://www.dukeoglue.com/) posted

Several people posted mobile phone photos on Twitter using the Twitpic
application, and a Greek software developer provided an auto-refreshing [web
service](http://www.wiggler.gr/grfires.php) to aggregate them, using the
#grfires hashtag.

**Politics in times of fire**

_Teacher Dude_ , a citizen photo-journalist based in Thessaloniki [focused on
the political
connection](http://teacherdudebbq.blogspot.com/2009/08/wildfires-engulf-greek-
towns-and.html) between wildfires and national elections:

> Although Greece regularly has wildfires [a study carried out by the Athens
> University of
> Economics](http://www.aueb.gr/conferences/Crete2009/papers_senior/Christodoulakis.pdf)
> suggested that there was a direct link between their destructiveness and
> national elections. According to Spyros Skouras and Nikos Christodoulakis
> half of the forest lost through fires in the last 54 years took place in the
> 16 years in which elections were held.
>
> The last serious fires to hit the country in 2007 took place just weeks
> before parliamentary elections and most political analysts consider the
> announcement of new elections within the next few months a certainty.

_Teacher Dude_ [reminisced on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/teacherdude/status/3489834429) about an earlier
firefighting effort in which he himself took part:

> I keep on remembering what happened here in Saloniki in 1997. I volunteered
> to help fight the fires. Scary how fast they can move.

… and also [commented wryly](http://twitter.com/teacherdude/status/3491062606)
that:

> The New Democracy [governing party] logo has new meaning now.
