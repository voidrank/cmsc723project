Waiting for El Nino Rains

Kenyans are waiting for the [El
Niño](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation) rains
anticipated between now and December 2009 with mixed feelings. Inasmuch as the
El Niño is itself a natural disaster that in it's ‘moderate’ form is expected
to displace at least 100,000 people and leave 750,000 in need of humanitarian
aid [according to IRIN](http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=86187),
most Kenyans actually want this El Niño.

Normally, people would be running scared at the prospect of drowning or losing
property and livestock in the expected El Niño flooding, but not this year.
The drought in the East African nation has been hard and long – with  at least
10 million Kenyans facing hunger (IRIN) – and the populace will take anything
with water in it: Even a natural disaster.

American national, Katherine Herzog, commenting on an Ewaso Lions blog post
titled [‘When will it rain, the drought persists in
Samburu’](http://ewasolions.wildlifedirect.org/2009/09/09/when-will-it-rain-
the-drought-persists-in-samburu/), said “A ‘moderate’ El Niño rain event will
hopefully transform the region which you skillfully and painfully describe.
Although rain on hard, dry ground usually means flooding – rain in any form
will be a boon for man, livestock and wildlife alike.

Wildlife is normally more tolerant to drought than humans and livestock but
wild animals are starting to die. [Ewaso Lions described the situation in
early September](http://ewasolions.wildlifedirect.org/2009/09/09/when-will-it-
rain-the-drought-persists-in-samburu/):

Predators are however doing well now that there are many weak and dying
animals making easy prey for them. There is however the increasing risk of
being hunted down by cattle herders as more and more livestock are driven into
the wildlife reserves in search of pasture and water. The presence of
livestock in wildlife territory means that they are likely to be preyed upon
by predators, which then will be killed, in retaliation, by the herders. Ewaso
Lions blog adds:

This was in early September and although a little rain has been reported in
western Kenya, with some flooding occurring in Kenya's third city Kisumu, El
Niño is not here yet. The drought continues. Even in the so called ‘wildlife
capital’ of the world, Nairobi National Park, the situation is no better. The
water holes are drying, there is no grazing or browsing vegetation, and the
situation is worrying. [Will Knocker posted on October
7](http://nairobinationalpark.wildlifedirect.org/2009/10/07/waitingwaiting-
for-rain/) saying:

On October 7 again, the [Lion Guardians continued to
lament](http://lionguardians.wildlifedirect.org/2009/10/07/the-drought-
continues/) about the [devastating
drought](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/20/kenya-devastating-drought-
worsens-human-wildlife-conflict/) reporting that the situation has
deterioriated [since they first
reported](http://lionguardians.wildlifedirect.org/2009/07/15/devastating-
drought/) about the drought. They say:

> _The drought is still continuing here, and the animals and people are
> struggling badly. Everyone hopes rain will fall soon and bring back some
> life to the parched land. The water hole near to our neighbouring lodge Ol
> Donyo Wuas is constantly visited by many elephants, as well as very thin
> herbivores like these zebras, all looking for the scarce water._

and,

> _There is no grass left to be eaten anywhere, and the wildlife and livestock
> are starving. These hills were once covered with long green grass – now
> there is nothing for the animals to eat._

In the Mara wildlands that flank the world-famous Masai Mara National Reserve,
the [Predator Aware blog reports
](http://predatoraware.wildlifedirect.org/2009/10/08/lone-lioness-on-the-
prowl/)difficult times for the Maasai community:

> _The Masai Mara communities are under huge pressure with the ongoing drought
> and the loss of cattle as pastoral ism is their number one income earner at
> present followed by tourism._

In response to a comment from one of the blog readers, Predator Aware laments
the dwindling of the wildlands lifeline, the Mara River, and utters the same
prayer that is on the lips of all these bloggers:

> _Yes the Mara River is seriously low . The degradation of the Mau Forest
> which is the headwaters of the Mara River as well as the drought have caused
> this. Rain is the only healer and we hope it comes soon._
