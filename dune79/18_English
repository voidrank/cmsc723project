_The Cuban Institute of Music_ has announced that popular Colombian singer
[Juanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanes) is [scheduled to
perform](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32291125/ns/entertainment-music/) at a
[“concert for peace”](http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=12458) in
[Havana](http://www.escambray.cu/Eng/culture/Cjuanesdos090806203.htm) come
September 20th. _[Repeating
Islands](http://repeatingislands.com/2009/08/12/juanes-to-offer-
sept-20-concert-in-havana/)_ blog confirms that:

> The Communist Party newspaper _Granma_ quoted Osmany López, the institute’s
> vice president, as saying the 36-year-old winner of five Latin Grammys last
> year ‘is very excited’ about an open-air concert that will include other
> Latin American stars…

Juanes may be one of the few who are excited. Cuban bloggers? The jury is
still out. Faced with criticism – especially from the Cuban diaspora in the
U.S. – about the political signals he may be sending by participating in the
event, Juanes has defended his position both in [the mainstream
media](http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/831) and via [his _Twitter_
feed](http://twitter.com/juanestwiter). But a few bloggers seem unconvinced.

_[El Cafe Cubano](http://elcubanocafe.blogspot.com/2009/08/juanes-wants-to-do-
concert-in-cuba.html)_ asks:

> Now will Juanes also ask for the release of political prisoners? Will he ask
> for FREEDOM of Speech for Cubans? Will he ask for Democracy in Cuba?

_[The Cuban Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2009/08/go-juanes-
go.html)_ agrees that “his concert won’t change the world, much less Cuba”,
but does concede that “it has the makings of a great success, and thousands of
Cubans will love it”. The blogger does a good job of laying out both sides of
the coin:

> Interviewed on Univision last night (story and video excerpt
> [here](http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=10383&schid=10560&secid=1084&cid=2045305#p)),
> he spoke very much as an artist, not a politician. But he also expressed a
> faith that his idea of a concert in Havana is not only deeply right, but
> meaningful in a way that approaches the boundary of politics: ‘To go play in
> Cuba is sort of impossible…to go to Cuba is a symbol that it is time to
> change minds…I want to go to Cuba with my friends to tell the world from
> Cuba that people need to change.’
>
> Juanes’ initiative is drawing a reaction in Miami. ‘When talking about Cuba,
> one can’t ignore politics,’ Cuban American star Willie Chirino said on the
> same Univision program. And he’s got a point – Juanes’ claim that he’s not
> involved in politics, but he wants to change the world, is a little hard to
> grasp, even though it’s the kind of thing that artists say all the time.

[The post](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2009/08/go-juanes-go.html)
continues:

> Critics are right to point out that in Cuba, there are no private concert
> venues or promoters, so an event like this has to be approved by the
> government. Since it’s a government venue, there’s the possibility that a
> government official may appear on stage and make a speech. And there are
> those who are mystified about a concert for peace in Cuba, when Cuba is not
> at war. They’ve got a point too.
>
> Some say Juanes shouldn’t go at all, and his concert will be immoral if he
> doesn’t bring Cuban American artists and use his platform to criticize the
> Cuban government’s human rights record.

Finally, the blogger declares, “I cast my vote with Juanes.” So does Havana-
based [Yoani Sanchez](http://www.desdecuba.com/generationy/?p=867):

> It appears that on the September 20th, Juanes will try to put a human face
> on an architectural ensemble where no one is going to go and sit placidly.
>
> I think that Juanes should come and sing. If his subject is peace, he will
> have to know that this Island is not immersed in bellicose conflict, but
> neither does it know concord. He will raise his voice before a people who
> have been divided, classified according to a political color and compelled
> to confront any who think differently. A population that for years has not
> heard talk of harmony and that knows the punishment given to those who dare
> to voice their criticisms. We need his voice, but only if he comes to sing
> without forgetting any Cuban, without rejecting any difference.

Even so, Sanchez is all too aware of the political reality surrounding the
event:

> We would like him to accompany his song with the cadence of Willy Chirino,
> the trumpet of Arturo Sandoval, the rhythm of Albita Rodríguez or the
> sensual sax of Paquito D´ Rivera… but none of them will be allowed to be
> there. Juanes will enjoy the privilege of the foreigner, who on this Island
> is worth much more than the natives. Everything he says between songs—if he
> says anything—will be interpreted as his support for a system that ebbs
> away, as the accolade to a group in power.
>
> It was not an innocent decision to choose the Plaza of the Revolution as a
> stage for his music and he will not be able to shake the political weight
> that it carries. But if it has to be so…then let him sing under the statue
> of Martí, facing the image of Che Guevara, but at least let him sing for
> everyone.

_[The Cuban Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2009/08/go-juanes-
go.html)_ , who knows that the “kids of all ages” back home “will be there for
the music”, has the last word:

> If they find out that some opposed the concert because it didn’t include the
> right political message, then they will get the idea that the ideological
> rigidity that smothers all kinds of beneficial creativity, expression, and
> enterprise – not to mention just plain fun – is alive and well, not only in
> the buildings surrounding the Plaza de la Revolucion.
