[A magistrate in Lusaka acquitted](http://www.thisday.co.tz/News/6200.html)
former Zambian President [Frederick
Chiluba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Chiluba) of corruption charges
this week in a ruling that has received mixed reactions in Zambia.

Chiluba was accused of stealing about $500,000 to support his extravagant
lifestyle when he served his two term from 1991 – 201 after defeating Zambia's
first President,[ Dr. Kenneth
Kaunda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Kaunda), in Zambia's first multi-
party elections.

Although Chiluba supported his successor, the late[ Levy
Mwanawasa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levy_Mwanawasa), it was Mwanawasa who
pushed for the Parliament to lift Chiluba's immunity in 2002 to facilitate
criminal proceedings against him. Earlier this year, the London High Court
found him guilty and ordered him to pay back the money he stole from the
government.

Following the judgement that cleared him of corruption charges, Chiluba's
lawyers have written to the Speaker of the National Assembly demanding the
restoration of his presidential immunity.

In Malawi, the former President Bakili Muluzi is also facing corruption
charges.

Let's see what Zambian bloggers and their readers say about the judgement and
the future of the fight against corruption in Zambia.

[“Justice by executive order- The Era of Bwezani
Banda”](http://mwakonle.blogspot.com/2009/08/justice-by-executive-order-era-
of.html), is the title of a post by Mwankole in reaction to the ruling.
Mwankole argues that the current President, Rupiah Banda, influenced court's
judgement:

> Despite the overwhelming evidence presented, which in some bizarre fashion
> was sufficient to convict his principal accomplices Faustin Kabwe and Aaron
> Chungu to 3 years of hard labor prison sentences, Chiluba come off without
> the slightest pretense of a reprimand. Chiluba was the President in charge
> when Kabwe and Chungu were stealing; further the evidence for all intents
> and purposes points to the duo carrying water on Chiluba’s behalf.  
>  Doesn’t he bear some responsibility, if not all? Does the buck not stop at
> plot one?
>
> Proof that it is not the weight of evidence that determines the outcome of
> significant legal cases in Zambia; it is the executive that calls the
> shorts.  
>  It therefore follows, that Magistrate Jones Chinyama had to buy himself
> more time before passing judgment on Chiluba, a whole weekend to consult the
> almighty Rupiah Bwezani Banda [The President of Zambia]. He then had, come
> up with 6 hours long blah…blah, that let loose without so much as a slap on
> wrist, one of Zambia’s most unscrupulous plunderer simply because the
> current plunder did not want a precedent set.

Another one[ warns African

Zambia Watchdog writes about the call for [restoration of Chiluba's
immunity](http://watchdogzambia.com/?p=1179):

Zambian Progress thinks that the ruling is [an indication of Zambian
government weakness on
corruption](http://zambianunion.blogspot.com/2009/08/chiluba-acquittal-mmd-
govt-is-weak-on.html):

> weak, soft and legally incompetent to prosecute corruption cases.We not
> blame for the magistrate for acquittal; but hold MMD accountable for failing
> to prove the case.

> Then, there is RB telling the nation that he is happy for Zambians to accept
> Chiluba walk to freedom; please!!! Chiluba was already accepted by Zambians.
> We Know he destroyed the economy through credit privatisation of the
