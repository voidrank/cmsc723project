opposition leader and global democracy icon [Aung San Suu
Ky](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/05/myanmar-64-words-for-aung-san-
suu-kyi/)i was sentenced to three years imprisonment for violating the terms
of her detention. Myanmar’s military ruler Snr Gen Than Shwe later commuted
the sentence to [18
months](http://www.irrawaddy.org/opinion_story.php?art_id=16533) of house
arrest.

Myanmar authorities accused Suu Kyi of allowing American national John Yettawv
to stay in her lakeside house last May which is a violation of the terms of
her house arrest. The American was sentenced to seven years of hard labour and
imprisonment. Both Suu Kyi and Yettawv are
[appealing](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/448302/1/.html)
the guilty verdict.

Suu Kyi’s conviction was condemned by world leaders, Burmese activists, and
also [bloggers](http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/edge-links/147053-no-surprises-
suu-kyi-facing-extended-house-arrest.html). Twitterers based in Southeast Asia
also reacted to the “harsh” sentence:
