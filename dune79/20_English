Beginning from Jan. 1, 2009, [stem cell
therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell#Treatments) in Hungary is
regulated in accordance with an international regulation that makes extremely
strict conditions concerning the use of stem cells in therapeutic treatment.
The medical website
[Medizona.hu](http://www.medizona.hu/egeszseg/20090730_ossejtbeultetes_miert_veszelyes.aspx)
(HUN) writes that the competence of stem cells and the methods of their use
must be controlled via professionally established animal tests. Then, these
can be examined on human body with adequate permissions, and only following
the rules of clinical tests.

Last week, four people were arrested on suspicion of giving illegal stem cell
treatments. According to police reports, the treatments were carried out not
just in Budapest and [Kaposvár](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposv%C3%A1r),
but in hotel rooms and private homes around the country. _Hungarian Spectrum_
[reports](http://esbalogh.typepad.com/hungarianspectrum/2009/07/stemcell-
therapy-business-in-hungary.html):

> […] The Hungarian police arrested four people: “B. Julliy” who turned out to
> be Yuliy Baltaytis, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen; a Ukrainian woman,
> Natalia K., who apparently supplied the embryonic stem cells from Kharkov
> and Kiev; and two unnamed Hungarians, one of whom was charged with assisting
> the doctors “in the transportation of the cooling equipment, the handling of
> shipments from Ukraine, and the transportation of the patients to and fro.”
> The police claimed that the “therapists” demanded 5 million Hungarian
> forints ($25,000) for a single treatment. […]

[The Budapest Times](http://www.budapesttimes.hu/content/view/12756/27/) has
more on the case:

> […] The suspects have been identified as Ukrainian-American medical
> professor Yuliy Baltaytis, plastic surgeon István Seffer, and a Ukrainian
> biologist known as Natalia K. A company called Institute for Regenerative
> Medicine (IRM), based in Kaposvár, was responsible for the treatments and
> CEO of the company Sándor Szabó is the fourth detainee, according to MTI.
> IRM rented space from Seffer & Renner clinic, said Tibor Seffer, managing
> director of the clinic and brother of István Seffer. He added that the IRM
> laboratory was separate and the Seffer clinic had nothing to do with stem
> cell research. […]

_Hungarian Spectrum_ adds:

> […] The CEO of the company was Sándor Szabó and on the board we find Imre
> Pákh, István Seffer, the plastic surgeon from Kaposvár, and Ádám Fásy, a
> “media star” who apparently became rich as a result of starting beauty

> called “Fásy mulató.” “Fásy Revelry.” […]

A year ago, a 31-year-old mother who was looking for treatment for her son's
[Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy), wrote [a
post](http://izomdisztrofia.blogspot.com/2008/04/ssejtbeltets-
magyarorszgon.html) (HUN) about Dr. István Seffer, one of the Hungarian
doctors who were arrested, because she intended to resort to the treatment:

The treatments were based on stem cells retrieved from aborted foetuses.

According to the Hungarian news agency MTI, Péter Zamecsnik, the defense
lawyer of István Seffer, announced that the doctor was released Thursday from
detention to house arrest.
