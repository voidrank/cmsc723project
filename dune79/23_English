Explanation for [changing conference dates](http://www.kelele.org/blog/kelele-
explanation-for-date-change/):

> Greetings African Bloggers.
>
> As the organizing committee of the KELELE Bloggers Conference, we would like
> to apologise for the postponement of the African Bloggers
> Conference—KELELE—which was due to take place from 13th to 16th August, 2009
> in Nairobi, Kenya.
>
> The African Bloggers Conference is an initiative of Kenyan bloggers and as
> the organizers we required significant financial support to underwrite the
> event. Although many sponsors had initially expressed interest in being a
> part of this great undertaking, due to the prevailing global economic
> climate they did not come through as we had anticipated.
>
> We also encountered a setback while working out the logistics of
> partnerships with a sister event, namely the African Blog Awards. The
> African Blog Awards were to take place prior to the conference. The awards
> were designed to give Africans a chance to vote for the best blogs across
> the region with the winners from each country being awarded an all expenses
> paid trip to the conference.
>
> We are now pleased to announce that the inaugural Kelele, Bloggers
> Conference will take place in Nairobi from 29th October– 1st November, 2009.
>
> Mark your calendars, book your tickets and pack your bags because this is a
> conference you cannot afford to miss!
>
> Subscribe to our newsletter here for more information on how to register for
> the conference.
>
> Beat your Drum!

The theme of this year's conference is [Beat Your
Drum](http://www.kelele.org/blog/news/kelele-2009-confirmed/):

> The theme of the conference is ‘Beat your drum’, a befitting theme that not
> only defines the influence that Africa has had in the world’s history mainly
> through its musical sounds but the sounds that have now entered the digital
> age into the blogosphere as the voice of its people.
>
> With so many voices marginalised or simply ignored in the African society
> today mostly due to a lack of a free space, we believe that the internet in
> general and grassroots media tools such as blogs in particular represent the
> most powerful way in which Africans can take back their voice.
>
> “We are gathering to make a powerful, positive, inspirational noise that
> will be heard across the continent and beyond; KELELE!” says Daudi Were the
> Kelele Project Coordinator and one of the KenyaUnlimited administrators.
>
> African bloggers have defied all odds to tackle fundamental issues that are
> facing their communities as well as highlighting developments in technology,
> sport, music and art.
>
> The conference is aimed at gathering Africa’s top grass root activists for a
> discourse and to create a synergy on the Internet. This will be the start of
> other similar conferences under the Kelele banner that will be held annually
> in different African Cities and will be run by an organizing committee in
> that city.
