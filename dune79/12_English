Although held in May, some media outlets in Azerbaijan last week reported that
43 people who voted for the Armenian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest have
been identified by police and one has even been called in for questioning.
Still effectively in a state of war over the disputed territory of Nagorno
Karabakh, the news is just the latest of [many scandals surrounding both
countries](http://frontlineclub.com/blogs/onnikkrikorian/2009/05/festering-
wounds-overshadow-eurovision-in-the-south-caucasus.html) in the international
music competition.

_The Snowolf_ says that it is not sure [whether the news is alarming or
entertaining](http://uksnowolf.blogspot.com/2009/08/one-that-says-it-was-only-
song-jeez.html). By the end of the post, however, the blogger seems to have
decided on the former.

_Brett Neely_ [comments on the Soviet-era
tactics](http://brettneely.com/2009/08/17/eurovision-vote-leads-to-forced-

Others are not surprised, especially as Eurovision was already off to a bad
start with [Georgia's aborted entry in
February](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/02/19/georgia-eurovision-
controversy/). _Eurovision central_ [has
more](http://eurovisioncentral.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/inquiry-into-
azerbaijani-votes/).

_A Fistful of Euros_ says that the news is [indicative of the state of
democracy](http://fistfulofeuros.net/afoe/culture/a-eurovision-story/) — or
lack of it — in both republics.

> That said, Armenia has a formal opposition. The Armenian press is free-ish.

_Notes from the Bartender_ says the incident is Orwellian, but [adds that the
song didn't deserve being voted for in the first
place](http://notesfromthebartender.wordpress.com/2009/08/18/eurovision-song-
contest-and-patriotism/).

_Life after Helsinki 2007_ [calls the heavy-handed tactics
absurd](http://ilkar.blogspot.com/2009/08/eurovision-vote-is-matter-of-
national.html), while The Armenian Observer simply concludes that if only 43
Azeri citizens voted for Armenia in this year's competition, and [reportedly
without the telephone number to do so being
displayed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/16/armenia-azerbaijan-
political-eurovision/), it is [unlikely that any will do so in
2010](http://ditord.com/2009/08/16/armenian-azerbaijani-relations-in-a-
snapshot/).
