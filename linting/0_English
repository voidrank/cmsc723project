Wildlife activists and organizations around the world are determined to make
sure that this is really “The year of the Tiger”. They have seized this
opportunity to step up their activities and bring global attention to this
majestic, yet severely endangered species in the ever diminishing animal
kingdom.

According to[
WWF](http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/media/press/2010/WWFPresitem15288.html)
only 3,200 tigers exist in the wild in Asia – which comprises the largest
habitat for these animals – but this number is also at serious risk because of
poaching, illegal trafficking and habitat loss.

It seems like the idea to embrace the year to spread awareness is being taken
very seriously.

WWF launched the [“Year of the Tiger
campaign](http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/media/press/2010/WWFPresitem%2015288)”
by releasing “Top Ten Trouble Spots” in the world where the animal is
suffering a serious crisis. They cover places like China, India, Siberia,
South-east Asia, Bangladesh and even the U.S, where more Tigers are kept in
captivity than are left in the wild. According to WWF, an estimated 3000
tigers or more are in captivity in the United States.

This number is truly alarming and it makes you wonder, is this any different
from the Tiger Farms in China? The [Tiger Farms in China](http://cat-
chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2009/03/tiger-farms.html) are truly an
embarrassment for human beings today and what we are capable of doing to these
majestic beasts.

Tigers have been used in traditional [Chinese medicine for
centuries](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1252500/Exposed-Dark-
secret-farm-tigers-bodies-plundered-make-185-wine.html), and now even wine. It
looks like that trade is not going to stop very easily in the near future
because a battle is raging out there about whether legalizing the sale of
tiger bones and body parts will help stop poaching of the wild ones.

According to [Michael](http://cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2009/03/tiger-
farms.html) who blogs about cats (mainly):

[Sciblogs](http://sciblogs.co.nz/chthonic-wildlife-
ramblings/2009/11/02/problems-and-solutions-to-tiger-poaching-are-we-getting-
any-closer/), a blog from New Zealand which “brings the best science bloggers
from the country on one website….”, said China has put forth the argument that
farms are a healthy alternative to preventing and reducing poaching of these
animals in the wild. Organizations like WWF and CITES (Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species) have come up against a tough fight
with the Giant.

And China may be winning this argument because many conservationists who are
left with no solution are now wondering whether flooding the market with Tiger
bones and parts from the farms might really reduce attacks on wild tigers.

[ Michael](http://cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2009/03/tiger-farms.html),
who has been outraged with this argument, countered it with graphic and lurid
pictures from Tiger Farms in China:

> What you are looking at is the [ most popular wild animal in the
> world](http://cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2009/03/tiger-is-worlds-

So does legalizing sale of Tiger parts and Tiger Farming reduce the plight of
the Tiger? Far from it, it seems. According to WWF a study conducted by the
[World Bank and the International Tiger
Coalition](http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/globalmarkets/wildlifetrade/tigerfarms.html)
both have debunked that argument saying that :

> Given the unpredictability of the market environment along with the fact
> that there are only 3,500 tigers in the wild, there is no room for
> experimentation,” said Varma to the ITC. “Commercial trading in tiger parts
> and its derivatives is not in the interest of wild tiger conservation.”

While many organizations, and individuals who care, are doing all they can to
spread the word about the plight of the Tiger, a blogger going by the name of
[Tatanoo](http://theregoesathought.wordpress.com/about-me-v2-0/) correctly
pointed out flaws about the current methods by activists to generate awareness
and solicit support for this cause:

> Save the Tiger – [_www.saveourtigers.com_](http://www.saveourtigers.com/),
> in my honest and unwanted opinion, is a very poorly executed social
> initiative. I am not sure if this has brought any mileage to Aircel but
> apart from creating some buzz, the initiative hardly does anything
> worthwhile. It lacks the soul and resolve that a social initiative requires.
> It applies armchair activism to an issue where its effect is debatable and
> the extent of change that can be brought is extremely limited. Let’s do a
> quick post-mortem of the initiative,”

he says and goes on to list the lame initiatives adopted by them.  
Nevertheless, something might be better than nothing. Many of us who celebrate
the Lunar New Year may not even have thought about the Tiger apart from just
seeing its picture on the calendar, but thanks to the armchair activism and
the internet calls for action, we are spurred to awareness.
