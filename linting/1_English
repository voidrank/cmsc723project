Appreciation of folk music has been a distinguishing feature of the Macedonian
culture, and thanks to selfless efforts of one dedicated blogger it spreads
through the blogosphere, too.

As part of the world heritage, traditional Macedonian music has been enjoyed
and reused world over, sometimes [without attribution](http://david-

An old [internet joke about ex-Yugoslav
stereotypes](http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=47752892&blogId=294810934)
– which has been circulating for at least 12 years – states that one of the
top 10 advantages of being Macedonian is:

> 4\. You get to be sad and suffer while listening to folk music.

This cultural feature extends to good times also, as the
[EVS](http://ec.europa.eu/youth/youth-in-action-programme/doc82_en.htm)
volunteer Katarina Karcolova [noted](http://www.mladiinfo.com/2010/02/24/my-
new-home-macedonia-country-with-cyrillic-alphabet/) in her article on the
youth portal Mladi!nfo:

The most significant recent development related to folk music and poetry in
the Macedonian blogosphere is moving of the content of the Macedonian Folk
Songs [blog](http://pesna.blogspot.com/) to a dedicated domain and hosting
service – [pesna.org](http://pesna.org/) (the word for “song” and “poem” in
Macedonian), enabling its author Zoran Stalevski, aka _GoodBytes_ , to add
more functionalities, such as various kinds of sorting, and options for
translation into English, French, and German. In addition to this, he
[announced](http://mislam.blogspot.com/2010/02/pesnaorg.html) [MKD] that:

> … **All the songs are transliterated into Latin alphabet**. For instance “[А
> бре Македонче (A bre Makedonche)](http://pesna.org/song.asp?id=130)” [MKD].
> To access this version click on the tab “Transliterated.” This will aid at
> least two things: the foreigners would be able to read the text more easily,
> and it can facilitate access of search engines, whose users often don’t or
> can’t use Cyrillic.
>
> **Audio files** of the songs are no longer limited to one minute, but at
> popular request they are posted **complete**. However, in order not to
> violate the copyright of the performers, the downloadable mp3s are encoded
> to 32kbps. This is enough to hear the song or “to have it,” but no
> audiophile or folk music lover would be satisfied with such low quality.
> Therefore I assume they would buy the songs they like in the future. And if
> some musicians would like to share some of their rights to recorded
> performances, I would be happy to post the high-quality versions of the
> songs.

Mr. Stalevski also stated that he intends to finance the site with his own
funds till the end of his days, with some possible aid from online
advertising. In an interview for It.com.mk, he
[confessed](http://it.com.mk/index.php/Vesti/IT.mk/Site-makedonski-pesni)
[MKD]:

> I started the project as my personal hobby, but also out of revolt, because
> the institutions paid to promote our cultural heritage still use the
> computers mainly to play Solitaire while waiting to punch the clock.
>
> By collecting the songs, I followed [Gandhi’s
> dictum](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/mohandasga131253.html)
> that “you have to be the change you want to see in the world.” As the
> collection grew, I started receiving praises, advice and direct help with
> the texts or audio files from visitors who like folk music. This support
> from people world over, including foreigners interested in Macedonian
> language, culture and traditional music, provided inspiration for me to
> continue with enriching the website. I actually do not need financial
> contributions, because publishing online is not very expensive. But the
> project can really benefit from more audio files, especially of rare songs,
> which are almost impossible to find via regular channels. There’s a great
> need to digitize the audio/video archives of the [Macedonian Radio &
> Television](http://www.mkrtv.com.mk/), which hides an invaluable treasury,
> rotting in the cellars of that [black
> hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) of a “public broadcaster.”
> Probably some of those rare materials have been appropriated by some
> ethnologists or collectors – people I cannot easily reach.
