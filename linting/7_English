Maria Gromakova in China

The common notion that the Internet empowers those with democratic and liberal
values is occasionally challenged by stories coming out of Russian online
communities. The blogosphere can certainly be a place where people share
valuable content with wide audience, but it can also become a platform for
attacking virtual identities. Unfortunately, availability of information and
growing connections between virtual and real personalities make online
harassment as real as it gets.

Maria Gromakova, a young blogger from St. Petersburg, experienced the evil
potential of the Internet first hand. Constant attacks of Russian radical
nationalists on her blog turned Maria's life into a living hell and made her
and her small family leave Russia.

Maria studied philology at St. Petersburg University where she concentrated on
teaching Russian to foreigners. She also played at a local theater and worked
as an anchor at a local TV station. In 2007, Maria started teaching Russian at
one of the universities in China. There she met Bo, a professional athlete and
her future husband.

Maria [has been keeping a blog on Livejournal.com](http://maria-
gromakova.livejournal.com/) [RUS] since 2005. Colorful posts about life in
China quickly made her online diary popular with more 1,500 regular
subscribers to the blog posts.

Maria and Bo came back to St. Petersburg in 2009 just few months before their
son was born. Maria's blog was filled with joyful updates about their first
child. This turned out to be a terrible mistake.

In one of her blog posts, Maria told readers that she and her son had been
attacked on a city train. One of the passengers pushed Maria when she, Bo and
their son were getting off the train. Maria nearly fell down but Bo caught her
at the last moment. She also recollected that the person who pushed was loudly
complaining to his friends about “Russian whores who make mutants with
Asians.” Meant to expose an ugly face of Russian extreme nationalism, the blog
post caused a different effect.

“It all started with a young man who openly supports fascists’ points of
view,” Maria told in an interview to Global Voices. “He found my blog with
this story and photos of my child. He put those photos on his blog with
comments about “a bloody race prostitute who gave a birth to a defected
product from the racial perspective.”

This motivated many supporters of _[rock_my_cock](http://rock-my-
cock.livejournal.com/)_ , the blogger who started harassing Maria online, to
visit her blog and leave offensive comments and threats.

“I want our race to survive,” _rock_my_cock_ wrote to Maria. “It’s not a
question of personal desires, but eugenics. And you have wasted your genetic
code. I am very frustrated by it.”

_Rock_my_cock_ later deleted his account on Livejournal.com

But the harassment did not stop there. Few days later, Maria got an e-mail
that contained a photo collage with a terrifying name “How to cook a baby.”

“They wrote that the only way I can get excuse for my guilt against the
Russian nation for marrying Asian is to kill our ‘frog’ [the name Russian
nationalists gave Marina's son – GV), since ‘he is not human,’ and make a soup
according to instructions that were attached,” Maria said. “They also promised
to visit me and taste the soup. I was also required to divorce my husband
immediately or else they threatened to hurt him.”

Those people also said that they knew Maria's home address and phone number.

Unable to tolerate the harassment any longer, Maria published a blog post
where she revealed her intentions to find the people behind the threats and
report them to Russian authorities. The blog was hacked soon after the post
and all blog content was deleted. The same thing happened to Maria's and Bo's
e-mail accounts. The hackers later published “How to cook a baby” collage on
Maria's blog and wrote that “the soup from the son was very delicious.”

Maria did not have any choice but to [address the blogosphere](http://wang-yi-
bo.livejournal.com/1240.html.) __ [RUS]:

> Господа!
>
> Это Мария Громакова строчит с аккаунта своего мужа.  
>  Сегодня ночью наши отечественные фашисты взломали мне ЖЖ!  
>  И удалили ВСЕ записи, начиная с 2005 года. […]  
>  Поэтому очень прошу всех, кто может мне хоть чем-то информационно или по

Gentlemen,  
this is Maria Gromakova typing from a blog account of her husband. Tonight our
local fascists hacked my Livejournal. They deleted ALL blog posts starting
from 2005. […] That is why I ask everyone who can help me somehow in terms of
information to get in touch with me via mobile phone or send me a text
message. Or, without getting in touch with me, do something to help me!

The word about the story spread around Russian online community and led to
angry reaction from ordinary bloggers. LJ user _Pushba_
[_wrote_](http://pushba.livejournal.com/138499.html):

> Где мы живет и о чем мы думаем – уже не важно. Важно то, что меня трясет,

Where we live and what we think is not important. What is important is that I
am shaking when I think of fascism, especially in context of our country. I,
of course, understand that this bastard [ _rock_my_cock_ user – GV] only tries
to increase his blog rating by the similar posts but I cannot help but write
about it. In this case, brutality is defeated by brutality. Is there anyone
who can cook this guy?

At the same time, some people were afraid to actively defend Maria. They did
not want to turn into the next victims of the nationalists. In his post
“Nationalists hack accounts on Livejournal,” LJ user _desp-immigrant_
[wrote](http://desp-immigrant.livejournal.com/136964.html):

Of course you can do it [help Maria-GV] if you are not afraid that people will
do to your blog the same thing they did to Maria's. It is a risk, real and not
very small. But if you don't react to that because it doesn't concern you
personally, you know what it can grow into. It already happened in the past.

Several bloggers blamed Maria for revealing her true identity online. “The
reaction of the majority of people was ‘it's your fault,'” Maria told Global
Voices. “They told me that I shouldn't have kept the blog. I shouldn't have
posted photos online and shouldn't have talked about my family. They said if I
wrote about birds and butterflies, nobody would have harassed me. But since I
am not ashamed of my Asian husband and my child, I have attracted all that.”

Tatyana Tihomirova (a.k.a. LJ user _Tanchik)_ is one of the most active
defenders of Maria. She[ blamed](http://tanchik.livejournal.com/412156.html,)
[RUS] boggers for being passive and dismissed any allegations that Maria was
the one to blame for what happened to her. __

When all of you will understand that all those freaks [nationalists-GV] can
act in real life and online only because you […] keep your silence even in the
situations when all that unfolds in front of your eyes and you advise to
“ignore it.” If you ignore it on Livejournal, you ignore it in real life.
Don't be surprised that people will ignore you when you become victims online
or in real life.

Tatyana urged other bloggers to monitor activities of radical blogs and
collect any documents and posts that violate Livejournal's terms of use. She
suggested informing Livejournal administration of any evidence of abuse.
Tatyana also called for lawyers to help Maria.

Indeed, many bloggers tried to assist Maria in her online struggle. Some
helped by spreading the word around the blogosphere and making the topic one
of the most discussed online. Others helped to restore Maria's e-mail account.
A special collective effort was targeted at identifying the attackers. Maria
shared IP addresses and nicknames of bloggers who harassed her and the online
community helped to reveal the attackers’ real identities.

But the online attacks on Maria continued. She would get text messages with
fascist content on her mobile phone. The threats against her and her son also
did not stop. At some point, the hackers cracked her personal profile page on
a popular Russian social network Vkontakte.ru. They also stole $35 from her
mobile phone account.

Maria was desperate. She [wrote a blog post](http://maria-
gromakova.livejournal.com/414476.html) [RUS] where she alleged that she became
a victim of not only fascists and radical nationalists, but also many ordinary
and respectable people who usually prefer not to show their xenophobia in real
life. Maria suggested that those people use anonymity online to hide their
real identities and their hatred of foreigners. She warned that those online
actions can easily grow into something real and more dangerous that could
affect everyone:

> Да, меня, как и всю эту историю, через день-два забудут. Жизнь продолжается.  
>  Невозможно всё время жить на баррикадах. Глупо. Да и не нужно.  
>  Просто не забывайте, что на моём месте легко можете оказаться ВЫ.  
>  Ваша семья. Дети. Внуки. Друзья и близкие.

People will forget me and the whole story in a couple of days. The life goes
on. It is impossible to live the whole line on barricades. It is silly. And it
is unnecessary. Just remember that it can easily happen to you. It can happen
to your family, kids, grandchildren, friends and relatives.

Maria currently lives in Beijing with her husband and son. She said that the
online harassment had unfortunate consequences that made her leave Russia. A
story about Maria in one of Russian newspapers attracted the attention of
local immigration officers. They refused to issue a permission for Maria's
husband to stay in the country. They later came to Maria's apartment at night
to check Bo's immigration status and ordered him to leave the country withing
24 hours.

Maria's blog continues to be a target of online attacks.

“I can’t say the story has ended,” Maria said. “I know that people who
previously harassed me monitor my blog and occasionally write some ugly things
on their blogs and online communities. But at least they didn’t try to hack my
blog and e-mails or steal information since the middle of December 2009.”

What bothers Maria is that the people behind those online attacks are still
unpunished. Bringing legal actions against them requires Maria to be
physically present in Russia and she is not sure she wants to experience the
story all over again.

“The story proves that everything is possible on the Russian Internet,” Maria
said. “We just found ourselves on the edge. And we had to leave the country.
It’s good that we had an opportunity to leave. It would be worse if we
didn't.”

Maria's story raises few important points about nationalism and hatred on
RuNet. The phenomenon of
[trolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_\(Internet\)) [ENG] is not new
and very popular in Russia. There are some well-known examples when bloggers
were forced to stop a certain kind of online activity or even commit so-called
“online suicide” (erase their blogs). It also not surprising that online
attacks against Maria had a clear racist connotation.

The thing that attracts attention here is how the attacks unfolded. It is
clear that all this started almost by accident. The blogger who initiated an
attack
[wrote](http://pushba.livejournal.com/138499.html?thread=2507523#t2507523)
[RUS] later that stumbled upon Maria’s blog by chance when he was looking for
his friend with the same last name. He also tried to
[explain](http://pushba.livejournal.com/138499.html?thread=2502403#t2502403)
[RUS] the nature of his attack: ****

> Я цинично поржу над любой темой. Вообще над любой. Вообще делать из чего

I will cynically laugh at any topic. And I mean at any topic. It is delusional
to treat something like a holy object. I, frankly, don't give a s..t about
that narrowed-eyed freak, his father and mother. They sinned and that happens
to everyone. Someone sleeps with a rubber doll, someone sleeps with racially
inferior, everyone j..ks off as he wants. I knew what results and effects of
my actions would be like. And I am ok with all that.

However, in this case, we can point out few factors that go beyond the
phenomenon of trolling. The nature of attack might be approached as “cruelty
of anonymity commons.” The attack has a self-emerge and swarming nature.

The first post attracted attention of people who had a variety of reasons to
follow it. Those reasons ranged from mere curiosity to racism and fascism. The
further development of attacks went far beyond the control of their initiator.
This case showed how the Internet empowers the most radical elements of
society and gives them new tools to fulfill their goals without accepting any
responsibility for results. To some extent, we can treat this phenomenon as a
“[long tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail)” of political identity
when a radical minority has as strong impacts as majority. As we could see,
the only effective response here is self-emergence activity by the majority
that might stay passive and cautious about responding to the attack.

The self-emerged transformation of radical elements into attacking crowds can
take place not only online. In 2009, Russian security officials
[claimed](http://www.interfax.ru/society/txt.asp?id=74551) [RUS] that few
dozens of people were killed in Moscow area at the so-called “criminal flash
mobs.” It is especially common with hate crimes committed by Russian radical
nationalists.

“Following networked distribution of message with a detailed instructions,
people who don’t know each other gather at meeting points with one purpose –
commit a crime,” Igor Sundiev, an expert at the Russian Ministry of Interior,
said. According to Sundiev, people who participated in the flash mob agreed to
kill the first non-Russian that they see and run away. ****

There is another significant difference in Maria's case. Previously, the most
of “crowd based online” attacks targeted people who were considered public
figures in online or offline world. These attacks usually were limited to a
blog itself and used primarily trolling methods. In the case of Maria, the
victim was a private blogger.

Moreover the attacks had the most comprehensive nature than ever before. Not
only the blog, but all the possible online platforms that were related to
identity of the victim including e-mails, social networks and private content
pages turned into a target for violent hacking and destruction. So, this case
should be addressed as a multiplatform attack against online identity.

The effect of this kind of comprehensive attacks is growing due to increase in
importance of online representation. An online identity is not a luxury but a
crucial element in personal and professional development.

The story of Maria Gromakova is not the only story that proves it. Recently,
few dozens of blogs in Livejournal were erased by unknown attackers. Most of
bloggers who lost their blogs kept them for 5-7 years. The stories of these
bloggers show clearly that loosing a blog is not just an unpleasant accident,
but something that might cause a psychological trauma.

In the current information reality, blogs are not just a reflection but a part
of one’s identity. That is why the multiplatform attacks or acts of online
vandalism should be approached not just as private cases of hacking but a new
category of crimes – crimes against online identities. Consequently, a special
strategies and measures are required for defense and protection of online
identity representation as well as for facilitation of online community
response to this kind of crimes.
