The dispute over the [Western
Sahara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara) is a complex one–Morocco
claims it as their own, while the Saharan independence movement (the
Polisario), backed by Algeria, desires independence. Three years ago, talks
resumed between the Polisario and Morocco, but after four rounds of formal
negotiations, a conclusion still had not been reached. Morocco's current
proposal is autonomy, but the Polisario demands a referendum on the
territory's future, including an option for independence.

The [latest news](http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE61201V20100203)
is that talks are set to resume on February 10, informally, in upstate New
York. Bloggers are weighing in with their thoughts on what the future might
hold for the region. _Maghreb Blog_ , whose author is based in the U.S., gives
a bit of background to the conflict, and [offers this
opinion](http://maghreblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-upcoming-western-sahara-
talks.html):

> If the plan is not to their liking, which is obviously the case, then it is
> incumbent upon Algeria and the Polisario to step up to the plate and propose
> a non-obstructionist, realistic alternative. The blind rejectionism of
> anything Moroccan will only lead to maintaining the current status-quo
> largely in favor of Morocco at this point. Any meaningful compromise between
> Morocco and Algeria is beneficial, not only to the two countries, but also
> to the other three countries in the Maghreb region, as it could be a
> tremendous step towards full economic and political integration.

Commenter _Chasli_ expresses disagreement with the blogger's assessment,
saying:

> You and clearly Rabat are in total denial that the Polisario has already
> offered a plan. Shortly before Morocco officially came forward with their
> autonomy plan the Polisario presented a plan that called for a referendum
> that, as far as I can tell, could include just about anything as long as it
> included independence as an option. And if the inhabitants voted for
> independence the Polisario pledged to allow the illegal Morrocan colonists
> to remain and to institute a special relationship with Morocco. This is I
> feel a very impressive compromise that deals with a number of Rabat's
> concerns; however, because Rabat flatly refuses to discuss the UN-mandated
> referendum on self-determination they have totally ignored the Polisario
> plan.

The debate continues throughout the comments section. Blogger _Analitikis_
also takes on the subject in a recent post; discussing a recently-issued UN
statement, the blogger
[writes](http://analitikis.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/some-thoughts-on-the-
morocco-polisario-negotiations/):

> Reading the statement and subsequent euphoria on the seeming acceptance of
> the parties to engage in yet another round of “talks”, one would think that
> a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict is within reach; that all it
> takes is _a Security Council’s resolution, a Secretary General’s report, a
> Special Representative’s statement, and a parties half-hearted acceptance_
> for a 35-year-long intractable conflict to be resolved. Little attention is
> paid to the process, to the parties’ readiness, and to the contextual
> conditions that may signal the opposite. As far as I know, neither the
> parties nor the UN (I use the term loosely here) are ready for any kind of
> serious and honest engagement that would put an end to the conflict of
> attrition known as the Western Sahara conflict.
