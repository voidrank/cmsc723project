The Green Movement (Iranian opposition) uses different ways to
[protest](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/iranian-
election-2009/) against the Iranian regime. Some Iranian bloggers proposed
that people change their mobile tone into ‘Ey Iran’ song, a famous and popular
anthem in Iran to show their solidarity with the protest movement. Here is one
part of [the song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ey_Iran):

> Oh Iran, oh bejeweled land  
>  Oh, your soil is the well spring of the arts  
>  Far from you may the thoughts of evil be  
>  May you remain lasting and eternal  
>  Oh enemy, if you are of stone, I am of iron  
>  May my life be sacrificed for the pure soil of my motherland  
>  Since your love became my calling  
>  My thoughts are never far from you  
>  In your cause, when do our lives have value?

_Fermesk_ also [writes](http://fermesk.wordpress.com/) [fa] that the next step
of the Green Movement is to encourage people to change the ring tones of their
mobile phones into the Ey Iran song.

_Harfehesaby_[ notes](http://harfehesaaby.blogspot.com/2010/01/blog-
post_26.html) [fa] at the end of Iran-Iraq war, the Iranian radio started to
broadcast this song, which motivated many people to go to the front and fight.
The blogger says he hopes Iran would be free from its invaders on 22 Bahman
(11 February), the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.

Several bloggers make the song available in their blogs:
