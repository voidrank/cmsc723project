Voices new South Asia editor,
[Rezwan](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/rezwan/), from Bangladesh has
been with Global Voices as a volunteer author since 2005. Memorable posts by
Rezwan include a report on [Twittering’ an earthquake in
Bangladesh](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/07/29/bangladesh-tweeting-and-
blogging-an-earthqauke/), and a story of colorful but [expensive Bangladeshi
weddings](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/07/14/bangladesh-an-expensive-
wedding/). He replaces the illustrious [Neha Viswanathan
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/neha-viswanathan/)as South Asia
editor.

His personal blog, [_The Third World View_](http://rezwanul.blogspot.com/)
portrays Bangladeshis and Bangladesh in English to a global audience.

Eager to help create more content in Bangla on the web, Rezwan initiated the
Lingua website _[Global Voices in Bangla](https://bn.globalvoicesonline.org/)_
with fellow translators.

He is also Features Editor on [_Rising
Voices_](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/), a Global Voices project that
gives micro-grant funding to new blogging projects in some of the most
marginalized communities of the world. Here, Rezwan writes about the internet
connectivity problems facing [REPACTED bloggers in
Kenya](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2008/09/18/repacted-
challenging-the-digital-divide/), the explosive energy of [young bloggers in
La Loma,
Colombia](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2008/09/10/hiperbarrio-
and-convergentes-for-the-community/), and shares the beautiful photos taken by
[Bangladeshi women-bloggers of Nari
Jibon](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2008/08/14/nari-jibon-
making-a-difference/).

**Why did you start your personal blog in 2003 and what was the reason you
chose to write in English?**

> I was in Dhaka then, and I read a story in a local newspaper about the
> famous Iraqi blogger [Salam Pax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam_Pax),
> who was writing an online diary about the Iraq war and the effect it was
> having on his everyday life. I started reading his blog and also came across
> some other interesting blogs.
>
> This inspired me to start my own blog sometime in April 2003. At first I
> could not figure what to write. But I soon found out from the other blogs
> that there are huge misconceptions about Bangladesh, mainly due to the
> absence of Bangladeshi voices on the Internet. And I found my focus: topics
> on Bangladesh and following the Bangladeshi blogosphere.
>
> In those days Bangla Unicode was only in the development stage so I could
> not blog in Bangla (as the reader had to have the same Bangla software/fonts
> I used). My focus was to communicate with the world, so English was the
> ready choice.

**How did you first hear about Global Voices?**

> I probably first came across the site because my blog was being linked by
> Global Voices. I was already doing small roundups in my blog and guest-
> blogging in a couple of regional ones.
>
> Then in July 2005 I received a mail from Global Voices co-founder Rebecca
> MacKinnon : “We find that we've been linking to you quite frequently over at
> Global Voices and would love to know a little more about you…” She requested
> me to post on Global Voices.
>
> I was thrilled to write for Global Voices, and the rest is history.

**What is your most memorable blogging experience?**

> I've have a lot of interesting experiences. I remember in April 2004 I
> traveled to Sri Lanka and blogged about it. I remember how desperate I was
> to find an Internet-connected PC to upload my pictures and post my daily
> report. This urge makes one a passionate blogger.
>
> I also get my share of amusements from the comments in my blog posts. I
> wrote about the national ID card implementation process in Bangladesh, and
> sometimes I still receive comments from people who have specific queries
> like “My ID is lost. Please tell me how can I get a new one.”

**What persuaded you to start Global Voices in Bangla?**

> Bangla-blogging is relatively a new phenomenon. It really took off in
> December 2005 when a Bangla blogging platform was launched, breaking all
> technical barriers (it's now the largest). Bangla is spoken by 230 million
> people in the world, but because of absence of a unified Bangla computing
> platform (unicode) hundreds of Bangla online sites/publications in
> Bangladesh and India are not searchable and there is really a shortage of
> quality, Bangla content on the web.
>
> That is why I was interested in translating Global Voices content in my
> mother tongue. I knew that soon, more and more people would have access to
> the Internet, and I wanted them to be introduced to blogs around the world
> in their own language. We have 15 translators on board but only 4-5 are
> regulars. I hope we we will be able to find additional enthusiastic
> volunteers to join the team.
>
> The only thing you need to do now to read Bangla fonts is set your browser's
> character encoding to Unicode (utf8). Earlier you needed to download at
> least one unicode Bangla font, but now most recent operating systems come
> with everything pre-installed. Check
> [here](https://bn.globalvoicesonline.org/bangla-settings/) if you face
> problems either typing or reading Bangla fonts
> (<https://bn.globalvoicesonline.org/bangla-settings/>).

**What have you learned about citizen media through your writing about the
Rising Voices projects?**

> I enjoy following the developments of the various Rising Voices grantees. I
> come from a developing country myself and can relate to many of the
> challenges they face, like getting connected to the Internet, or just to be
> able to sit in front of a computer. I still hear from bloggers back home
> that sometimes they open a web page, and it takes so much time to load, they
> can grab a cup of tea and finish it while they wait. But these people are
> still passionate to blog, and this is true for participants in [every Rising
> Voices project](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/), whether in
> Madagascar, Kenya or Dhaka. Highlighting their efforts makes me realize more
> and more, that what we are doing is right.

**What do you feel are some of the most important developments in Bangla
citizen media in the past year?  
**

> The first one was the Bangla blogging platform I discussed above. Now we
> have 4-5 platforms with thousands of users and many, many readers, and they
> have a growing competition between them. The blogs on other multilingual
> platforms like Blogger, WordPress etc. are also coming up.
>
> Soon a popular Bangla news daily from Bangladesh will be introducing
> blogging services and others will follow suit. The Bangladeshi government
> has declared that it will install computers and Internet connections in
> almost 10,000 schools across the country. I think we will soon see an
> explosion of blogging in Bangla.

**In South Asia as a whole, do you think citizen media has had any impact on
people's attitudes or understanding of cultural and political differences?**

> Yes of course. We had different developments in the blogospheres in those
> countries but more or less the people have come to know about the power of
> blogging.
>
> The Pakistani blogosphere has shown their diversity and openness breaking
> through the stereotypes portrayed in the media. The Indian blogosphere is so
> huge and its regional language blogosphere are growing to emphasize the
> country's multicultural, multi ethnic heritage. In Bangladesh, where the
> traditional media ignore blogs and are more prone to self-censorship to
> protect themselves, the bloggers have broken all barriers to voice their
> opinion fearlessly and some journalists now prefer blogs to publish their
> investigative reporting.
>
> It also is fascinating to get perspectives from the bloggers about the Sri
> Lanka's ethnic disputes, Nepal's journey towards democracy, Bhutanese
> culture, and Maldivians opposition to their long serving President.
>
> The traditional media of these countries often follow the politics of
> acrimony which sometime augment nationalism and hatred between these
> countries. You just need to look at a common incident (e.g. the border
> dispute in India and Pakistan) and follow the newspaper coverage of both the
> countries, and you see how skewed the reports are. The bloggers are bridging
> the gap by adding a human touch to the issues, and are in fact creating more
> friends than enemies between those countries.
