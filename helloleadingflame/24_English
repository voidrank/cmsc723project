The political tension in Lebanon is escalating to critical levels with each
passing day. The latest [helicopter
downing](http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/080829/world/lebanon_unrest) by
Hezbollah managed to add more conflicts between the politicians and the
citizens as well. Intense debates and political opinions can be seen everyday
on the evening news and now on the blogosphere too. Local bloggers armed
themselves with their personal opinions and analysis, taking the “battle” into
their web spaces.

[_Tigermarks’_](http://lebreview.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/aouns-sectarianism-
is-sickening/) opinion on the current situation in Lebanon focuses this week
on [General Aoun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Aoun)’s recent comments
and press releases post the helicopter downing:

> Of course, he is throwing this out there to try to overshadow the Hezbollah
> killing of the helicopter pilot, whether by mistake or intentionally. He
> wants his supporters to focus on something else so he cooks up some more
> rumours and false claims of corruption against the March 14 block. Meanwhile
> corruption continues to fester in all parts of the Lebanese state and
> Hezbollah continues to play army in any part of Lebanon it wants to and
> continues to be the last word on whether we are at war or not.

Targeting the Lebanese Force's recent campaign in the opening of his latest
post, [_Bech_](http://remarkz.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/the-continuous-
downfall-of-political-maronitism/) writes about the Maronitism and what he
perceive as a sign of the downfall of its a political agenda:

> Now here comes the interesting part, early in the war, the Lebanese Forces,
> then a rising organization under Bashir Gemayel, proceeded into killing most
> of ‘the Tigers’, in effect removing potential rivals on the “Christian
> arena”. Dany Chamoun was spared till much later, assassinated along with his
> two little sons, wife, and dog, though maid and daughter could hide in
> closet. His daughter Tamara vehemently accuses Samir Geagea then and now
> leader of the LF of having perpetrated the act.

_Hanibaal_ ‘s frustration found its target in the newly elected Lebanese
President, [Michael Suleiman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Suleiman).
Hanibaal [_posts_](http://lebanoniznogood.blogspot.com/2008/09/president-
slime-sleiman-syrian-traitor.html) this news article calling the new president
a traitor and a pro-Syrian:

> “Slime” was appointed by the Syrian occupation as chief of staff of the
> army, and when the Syrian army was being evicted out of Lebanon in 2005 by
> the Lebanese people, this [President] followed his Syrian masters to Anjar
> to bid them farewell and tell them how sorry he was that they were
> leaving…How can he be anything but a traitor?  
>  There are no men left in Lebanon – only traitors and more traitors.

_The Owuet Front_ ’s blogger [_N10452_
](http://www.ouwet.com/n10452/critiques/a-major-misconception/)defended the
[_Lebanese Forces_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Forces) against
recent claims accusing them in the past to fight against the Lebanese army:

> It has come to my attention many people still think that the LF were
> fighting the Lebanese army back when Aoun was in command. This major
> misconception is very much exploited by Aounists and lately by Hezbollah who
> was trying to innocent himself from the murder of Army pilot Samer Hanna by
> showing the ‘atrocities’ the LF did to the army almost 20 years ago.

[_Bart Peeters_](http://middeno.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/saying-one-thing-
doing-another/) at _In the Middle of the East_ commented on two recent
published reports about the political and military situation in the south of
the country and draws back the attention to the helicopter incident:

> In Lebanon itself, meanwhile, a Hizbullah fighter last week mistakenly
> downed a helicopter of the Lebanese army, mistaking it for an Israeli one,
> thereby killing an officer and wounding two soldiers. Considering the
> Lebanese army owns a whopping total of 3 (three) helicopters, and Israeli
> aircraft are violating Lebanese airspace on a daily basis, this is not as
> far-fetched an explanation as it might sound… In any case, Hizbullah has
> owned up to its mistake and voluntarily handed over the 20-year old fighter
> to military police. Nevertheless, various parties in the country predictably
> continue to try and spin a lot out of the incident.
