new weapon in its fight against HIV/AIDS – cell phones. A new initiative will
be sending free text messages daily to encourage South Africans to get tested
and treated for the disease.

The project, called Project Masiluleke or Project M, was
[announced](http://www.poptech.org/blog/index.php/2008/10/24/project-
masiluleke-tackling-hiv-with-technology/) last week at the [Pop!Tech
2008](http://www.poptech.org/conferences/) conference in Maine, U.S.A. It
takes advantage of the popularity of cell phones in South Africa, using them
to fight the country's high rates of HIV and tuberculosis (TB). The first part
of the project will send the general public approximately one million free
text messages daily for a year, urging them to call HIV and TB call centers.
These messages will be sent as part of “Please Call Me” messages, a type of
text messaging widely used across Africa.

_White African_ [elaborates](http://whiteafrican.com/2008/10/24/frontlinesms-
clay-shirky-and-project-masiluleke/) on the project and this technology:

> “Gustav Praekelt – one of the most knowledgeable mobile phone specialists in
> Africa – is helping to run the program. It’s done using the 120 character
> free space in ‘Please Call Me’ SMS system that’s used in South Africa. They
> tack on messages to get people to come to get HIV treatment in private, so
> that they don’t have to worry about what stigma is attached to that
> treatment.”

Stigma, along with misinformation, are
[believed](http://www.poptech.org/project%5Fm%5Fthe%5Fchallenge/) to be the
main reasons why so few South Africans get tested and treated for HIV. Even
though [roughly 5.7 million people](
http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/south_africa.asp) in South
Africa are living with HIV, according to the project's organizers just [5
percent]( http://www.poptech.org/blog/index.php/2008/10/24/project-masiluleke-
tackling-hiv-with-technology/) of the population has been tested for the
virus. South Africa also has one of the [highest numbers of TB
cases](http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2008/key_points/en/index.html),
a common killer of people with HIV.

Project M was created to help combat both of these diseases. It grew out of
the [Pop!Tech Accelerator](http://www.poptech.org/accelerator/) program and
brings together an [international coalition of
partners](http://www.poptech.org/project%5Fm%5Fpartners/), including iTeach,
the Praekelt Foundation, frog design, Nokia Siemens Networks and the National
Geographic Society. _3 Sheep_[points out](
http://www.3sheep.co.uk/2008/10/25/south-africa-texting-health-care/) that
this project's use of cell phones shows how embedded they are in South African
culture, adding:

> “Many countries do not have an established hardwired infrastructure and are
> looking to the mobile network as means of mass communication…Previously
> other media, such as radio, would have been used for such work but the South
> African project demonstrates the importance of considering all channels for
> outreach.”

Though this is [not the first](http://mobileactive.org/cell-life-update-using-
mobiles-fight-hiv-aids) of such projects in South Africa, organizers
[say](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7688268.stm) it's the largest use
ever of mobile phones for sending health information. And so far the project
holds much promise. Early testing of this text messaging campaign [helped
triple](http://www.poptech.org/project%5Fm%5Fthe%5Fsolution/) the average
daily call volume to the National AIDS Helpline in Johannesburg. If the
project is successful post-launch, it's hoped that this model can be expanded
across Africa.

ahellgeth, commenting on a post on _African Globalization_ , [believes](
http://africanglobalization.blogspot.com/2008/10/texts-tackle-hiv-in-south-
africa.html) that this project has a lot of potential.

> “Using technology is a great way to get a strong message across to a mass
> amount of people. The use of text messages offer people to view the message
> over and over, compared to seeing the message on a commercial or a flyer one
> time. A text message usually sits in a phones mailbox for a couple of days,
> allowing that person to go back and view it. I think the message would truly
> stick with people allowing them to act on it…These texts are PSA’s [public
> service announcements] for cell phones.”

Dave, blogging on _Design in Africa_ [agrees](
http://designinafrica.posterous.com/project-masiluleke) that this project will
likely be a success:

> “An important issue is being addressed, a simple, easy to understand
> solution has been designed by combining the resources of stakeholders, there
> are measurable benefits for people and communities and the cost of the
> incoming message is free. Brilliant.”

But lablady, blogging on _Wise Advice_ , finds it unsettling that technology
has taken center-stage in the fight against HIV/AIDS. She [says](
http://wiseadvice.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/puzzling-aids-news-item/):

> “At what point in time did society make it an easier, more obvious and
> appealing choice for an impoverished population in the grips of an HIV
> epidemic, to buy a cell phone rather than a condom? I find it paradoxical
> that technology has now become the default vehicle to initiate what would
> have been at one time, a grass roots blood testing and education campaign.
> Is it arrogant of me to wonder why an entire population acquired cell phones
> before they had access to a successful public health strategy for a
> preventable disease?”

Catherine Forsythe, blogging on _DogReader_ , [adds](
http://www.lockergnome.com/forsythe/2008/10/24/health-text-messages/) that
these messages may eventually be seen as “health spam.”

> “The question may be ‘how long will this methodology be effective?’ After an
> initial viewing, these public health messages may be deleted as quickly as
> the usual text spam.”

Project M certainly hopes not. [Future
phases](http://www.poptech.org/project%5Fm%5Fthe%5Fsolution/) of the project
involve distributing at-home HIV testing kits, developing “virtual call
centers,” and using text messages to provide personalized healthcare
information for those being treated for AIDS.
