Around [500 people were
arrested](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a47Lg9rBLPFA&refer=home)
in Egypt Sunday as police quashed a [general
strike](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/04/05/egypt-gears-up-for-a-
general-strike-sunday/), in protest against the increasing cost of living and
calling for better wages.

And just as word about the strike was spread via massive text-messaging,
email, and popular social networking platform
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=9973986703), bloggers and
online activists kept the world abreast with arrests and developments on the
ground minute by minute throughout the day.

The strike, all over Egypt, created a rift in opinions, between those
confirming its success and others announcing its abortion and even failure.
Many people stayed home, as participants in the event and avoiding the day's
sandstorms or simply out of fear from the anticipated violent clashes that
might break out on the streets.

Witnesses reported light traffic on the streets, which were dotted with police
vehicles and swarming with plainclothes policemen. Throughout the day news
continued to pour in via Twitter, Facebook and blogs about arrests being made,
against protesters, politicians and citizens, including bloggers.

game-is-on/)_ posted regular updates but the star of the day was a [new
blog](http://6april08.blogspot.com/) (Ar) put up by activists, which invited
people to send in their stories, pictures and videos, to document the events
of the day. _[Tadamon Masr](http://tadamonmasr.wordpress.com/)_ also posted
regular updates, as they were happening throughout the day. Both blogs are
still updating the day's incidents as this report was being compiled.

_[Ghariba](http://stranger2day.blogspot.com/2008/04/httpnews.html)_ wrote in
detail about the events, quoting BBC Arabic, and adding a video of the clashes
in El Mahala, where the textile factories and the heart of the strike was,
featuring scenes of chaos:

The blogger added:

ونقلت مراسلة بي بي سي عزة محيي الدين عن مصادر امنية قولها إن عدد المعتقلين
اليوم بلغ 207 قبض عليهم فى محافظات القاهرة والجيزة والإسكندرية والبحيرة وقنا
.ومن بين المعتقلين اعضاء في أحزاب الغد والناصري والتجمع و حركة كفاية ومجدي
أحمد حسين الأمين العام لحزب العمل المجمد

The BBC correspondent Azza Muhiydin quoted security forces as saying that the
number of those arrested today reached 207, detained in Cairo, Giza,
Alexandria, Al Buhaira and Qana. Among those detained are members of the Al
Ghad, Al Nasseri, Al Tajamua’ and Kifaya Movement as well as the secretary
general of Labour Party Madji Ahmed Hussain.

In Mahala, things were literally aflame. Unlike the peaceful demonstrations in
big cities like Cairo, which were marred by detentions and the occasional
stand off with riot police such as that in from of the Lawyers Syndication,
Mahala's witnessed violent clashes between citizens and police officers.
Witnesses also confirmed the death of two people, including a nine-year-old.
Electricity was cut off, a gas station burned and a few shops were broken
into.

_[Zeinobia](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2008/04/mahla-on-
fire.html)_ reports “Mahala on Fire” and says:

> “The great Mahla is on fire currently , all the road to the greatest city in
> the middle East for the textile industries are blocked and closed even the
> trains going there are shifted to other cities in North Delta.  
>  We began to receive news at about 6 PM that Mahla on fire technically ,
> some one sent an email including the photos in the slide show below
> described the city as Egyptian Gaza.  
>  The forces used warning blots and tear gases ,along with sticks ,people
> were badly injured  
>  It reached the point of no return when two persons killed to become the
> first martyrs of the 6 of April which I always remember , the first one was
> 20 years old young man and the second was a 9 years old boy “strangely today
> in Gaza also a young boy was killed !!”, Yes it turned to be correct and
> true unfortunately.  
>  People there got angry ,more clashes ,unfortunately those who are engaged
> more in the fight are the youngsters from 11 to 16 years , there are weapons
> used like the local short swords , there are fires in the streets.  
>  Now the city is under a siege from the security forces.”

Despite the crackdown, a new [Facebook
Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=30053505614&ref=nf) was up and
running last night, inviting people for a new strike on May 4, to coincide
with the Egyptian President's Birthday. The group has so far attracted 1,300
members, and following is a quick draft of its initial demands for the
upcoming strike:

1-يوم 4 مايو اضراب و مضاهرات سلمية ان شاء الله  
2- اول اسبوع من شهر مايو محدش هيشترى فيه لحمه  
3- التجمع للمظاهرات يوم 4 مايو فى مكان هيتحدد بعدين و غالبا هيكون سرى  
4- التجمع للمظاهرات ان شاء الله هيكون داخل الجوامع و الكنايس انتلاشى ازى الامن
المركزى هنتجمع جواها باعداد كبيرة بعدد كده نخرج فى الشوارع و الميادي

ن

1\. On May 4, a peaceful strike and demonstrations.  
2\. No one shall buy meat in the first week of May.  
3\. Participating in demonstrations will be in certain secret places.  
4\. Gatherings will be in mosques and churches and we will then march to the
big squares and streets.

Though it is quite early to confirm the success of April 6 strike, and its
repercussions, it sure hit a nerve, with thousands of people mobilising
themselves and freely available online tools to demand their freedom,
equality, democracy and an honourable life for themselves and the future
generations of Egypt.
