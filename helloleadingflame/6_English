The [Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)](http://www.dpj.or.jp/english) won the
August 30th general election by landslide victory, bringing an end to more
than 50 years of almost continuous rule by the [Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_\(Japan\)) since
1955. The victory of Yukio Hatoyama-led DPJ has been perceived as the
beginning of a new era of Japanese politics. Apart from its [implications on
the Sino-Japanese dynamic](http://angrychineseblogger.blog-
city.com/japans_elections_a_china_watchers_view.htm), it would be interesting
to see how Chinese people reacted to the political change in their neighbor
country.

[NeiC](http://www.tianya.cn/publicforum/Content/funinfo/1/1603709.shtml) from
Tianya forum compared the fate of LDP with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP):

> 自民党被赶下台单独成栏的有三  
>  1.“铁饭碗”不复存在  
>  2.老龄化严重  
>  3.住房问题尖锐  
>  50年，不长不短的时间，我党也正好成立60周年。不得不让人不做比较~

(According to news commentaries from UK) There are three major reasons for the
LDP having been kicked out by voters:  
1\. “Iron bowl” no longer exists  
2\. Aging problem is getting worse  
3\. Housing problem is elevated
