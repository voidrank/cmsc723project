I would like to introduce you to [Leonard
Chien](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/author/leonard/), English-Chinese
translator and interpreter from Taiwan, and a Lingua powerhouse for Global
Voices. At the recent [GV Summit in
Budapest](https://summit08.globalvoicesonline.org/), Leonard famously
announced that we would always know when he had a day off as he would
translate more articles of Global Voices that day. In fact, when asked what he
would chose for a superpower he said “May I increase my translation rates?” So
what more can we learn about Leonard than his love for translating? Read more
to find out.

**You have been writing in your blog _[“Back from the
World”](http://leonardchien.wordpress.com/)_ since July. Why did you start
writing, and why did you decide to write in English? **

> I start this blog after coming back from GV Summit in Budapest. I used to
> blog only in Chinese. After the summit, I feel strongly motivated to stay
> connected with all the people I know during the Summit. In this case,
> blogging in English seems to be necessary. GV people “know” each other more
> or less via internet, but meeting in person is a totally different story.
> With that experience in Budapest, I am more attached to Global Voices and
> this group of people. We often say “keep in touch” when we leave, and having
> an English blog, to me, is really the way to keep in touch with them.

**How and when did you get connected with GVO?**

> I started to translate English posts into Chinese as a practice and put them
> online since 2004. On November 15, 2006, I got an email from PipperL,
> another Lingua Chinese translator, inviting me to translate for GVO. I
> clicked the link, read it, and I am hooked. GVO combines two things I like
> the most: translation and international issues. That's how the story begins.
> I keep that particular email he sent to me until now, because in retrospect,
> it is truly a watershed moment in my life.

**Explain the work that you do for GV Lingua.**

> I translate GVO posts from English to Chinese. Also, Portnoy and I are
> managers for the whole GV Lingua projects. All we do is try to make the
> whole Lingua experience as enjoyable as possible.

**How does what you do for GV Lingua fit into the world of citizen media?**

> Traditional media, in every part of the world, only focuses on a few big
> powers and nearby countries, which leave most of the world in the dark. The
> beauty of citizen media, in my opinion, is to reveal news and perspectives
> that may be neglected or overlooked by traditional media. To many of my
> friends who only speak Chinese, GV Lingua has become the major source of
> African and Latin American news, for instance. We shine lights to places
> they won't be able to see in the past. Of course it is due to precious
> efforts from our authors around the world.

**As a translator, how do you decide what to translate?**

> I translate what I am interested. Some people emphasize we should translate
> what interests readers, but to me, they are “unimaginable mass”. I never
> know what readers really prefer, so I follow my heart. Time is sometimes a
> constraint. If I have other translation or interpretation works to do, I
> tend to do shorter posts. Earning a living is still crucial to a freelancer
> like me. I don't and can't oppose long, long articles. GV authors have every
> right to write posts as long as they want or need. Lingua translators will
> try their best.

**What is your most memorable blogging or translating experience?**

> The other day, one classmate asked me about the presidential election in
> Paraguay. I was surprised and wanted to know how she knew about it. It
> turned out that she read my Chinese translation of Eduardo Avila's
> [post](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/04/21/paraguay-ex-bishop-becomes-
> next-president/). That's when I know my translation has an influence to
> others for sure.

**How would you characterize the Taiwanese blogosphere?**

> The blogosphere in Taiwan has a wide variety of interests, such as travel,
> cuisine, and celebrity. Unfortunately, I am occupied by GV and other things
> that interest me more, so I don't pay much attention to it.

**Give me an example of your average day.**

> It would be quite boring to most people. I wake up normally at 8, do
> translation (GV included) before and after lunch, take a walk before sunset
> (to bookstores sometimes), read after dinner, and watch TV or movies for
> pleasure. Before bedtime, I write blogs or do more translation (GV
> included). The more paid works I have to do, the more eager I want to
> translate GV posts. Weird, huh?

**How do you see GV Lingua progressing over the next few years?**

> GV Lingua is booming in numbers for the past one and a half years. The trend
> will probably stay for a while. Then we should focus on ensuring every
> Lingua team is sustainable, as volunteers come and go. As Lingua manager, I
> feel obligated to help volunteers be connected to the whole GV community. I
> am still thinking of ways everyday.

**Do you have any hobbies?**

> I love reading, be it magazines, books, newspapers, websites, or others. I
> read four or five books at a time. After one or two chapters, I put down one
> book and read another, no matter how attractive the plot is. It may not
> sound good to others, but it's the way I am.

**What is your worst habit?**

> I love to collect advertising postcards, which my mom always complains
> because it occupies a sizable part of my place. Everyone should only take
> one postcard each, but I often end up bringing back two or three of the same
> kind, as I think I should have backup if I lose one of them. I even waste
> weekend afternoons walking around Taipei and looking for new ones. It's
> silly. I don't buy postcards for myself when I am abroad. I look for free
> ones.

**How did you view the people of GV before you met then in Budapest, and
afterwards?**

> I always think of GV as a group of people devoting their time and efforts
> towards their different goals. It's great that people with different
> interests can all benefit from GV experience, be it bloggers, translators,
> activists, etc. After meeting GV people in person, I can really feel this
> huge energy among us. Outsiders may think GV people are idealistic,
> opinionated or aggressive. These impressions may or may not be right, but
> the most important thing is, just as our Outreach Director David Sasaki
> says, “we are having a good time in GV.” I had a wonderful time in Budapest.

**Finally, describe yourself and how you see the world.**

> I am always optimistic, believing the world will be better in some ways
> tomorrow. I am always curious, wondering what surprises may come next. I am
> always talkative, trying to fill up all blanks in conversations. The world,
> online or offline, is a playground to me. We can always have fun.
