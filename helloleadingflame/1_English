After a [month of voting](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/08/the-best-
of-the-blogs-awards-have-you-submitted-your-blog/) and jury discussions, the
awards for this year's Best of the Blogs – [the
BOBs](http://thebobs.com/english/about/about-2/) – have been decided. This
annual event held by the Deutsche Welle Media Group aims to award bloggers who
contribute to their communities and promote freedom of expression.

In addition to [User
Prizes](http://thebobs.com/english/category/2012/?only_winners=true) (selected
by popular vote), a
[jury](http://thebobs.com/english/category/2012/jury-2012/) of bloggers, media
experts and activists have curated the best blogs, campaigns and media
projects in six multilingual categories.

**Best Blog**

Iranian journalist Arash Sigarchi (jury winner![The
BOBs](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2012/05/bobslogo2012.jpg) and user winner) and the Lebanese
author of Mowaten Jou3an (user winner) are this year's “Best Blog” winners.
Sigarchi, currently based in Washington, is the author of [Window of
Anguish](http://sigarchi.net/blog/) [fa], where he writes about social and
political issues in his homeland. While in Iran, he was arrested several times
for the content he published on his blog and was eventually sentenced to 14
years in prison. The unnamed author of [Mowaten
Jou3an](http://jou3an.wordpress.com/) [ar] covers diverse subjects related to
several countries including Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.

This year’s other Jury Awards went to:

**Best Social Activism Campaign:**[Free Syrian Blogger & Activist Razan
Ghazzawi](http://www.facebook.com/freerazan)

This campaign was launched after Syrian activist and former Global Voices
contributor Razan Ghazzawi was [arrested in
December](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/04/syria-free-razan-

Jordan. After her release she was taken into custody, released and [taken into
custody again](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/16/syria-razan-

release and that of her colleagues from the Syrian Center for Media and
Freedom of Expression, who have been detained since February 2012.

location. Reports can be made via the website, text message and via Twitter
hashtag.

Kuang](http://tudou.com/programs/view/pbnY80-BqaM/?fr=rec1&FR=LIAN)

This Chinese cartoon series, whose main character goes by the name Kuang

provocatively evoked China’s social ills.

**Reporters Without Borders Award:**[Abu Sufian’s
Blog](http://blog.bdnews24.com/author/abusufianIR)

Reporter from Bangladesh Abu Sufian uses his blog to report on crimes that
much of the mainstream media ignores, such as the recent killing of the
journalists Sagar and Runi. He has been vocal against extrajudicial killings
in Bangladesh, which take thousands of lives.

**User Awards in all categories and languages**

In addition to the Jury's Awards, the users have also chosen their favorite
blogs in all the categories and languages of this year's competition. You can
see the list
[here](http://thebobs.com/english/category/2012/?only_winners=true).

[![Fasokan](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2012/05/Fasokan.png)](http://fasokan.com/) Congratulations
from the Global Voices community to all the Award winners for their inspiring
work. We wish to send special greetings to Boukary Konaté for his [outstanding
work](http://fasokan.com/). When we talked to Boukary about what this award
meant for him, he answered:

> I got the news in a moment when my country is going through a military and
> political crisis. I consider this Education and Culture Award as an award
> for unity and peace for Mali.

According to jury member and Global Voices author, [Tarek
Amr](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/tarek-amr/) from Egypt who helped
review Arabic language nominees:

> The FreeRazan campaign is important on its own, but I also see it as symbol
> for acknowledging the struggle of the Syrian people and showing solidarity
> with political detainees in the Arab world, whether [ Abdulhadi
> Alkhawaja](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/04/28/bahrain-where-is-
> abdulhadi-alkhawaja/) in Bahrain, military trials victims in Egypt, and many
> other examples. Harassmap is also a great platform to help raise awareness
> about sexual harassment in Egypt, and help victims to speak up, especially
> when society often tends to blame the victim before blaming the harasser.”
