[Cameroon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon) was colonised by both the
English and the French. The historical legacy of colonial rule is reflected in
the linguistic division of the country. It is divided between the French-
speaking North and the English-speaking South. Although English speakers are
the minority, the Cameroonian English blogosphere is very active. Today, we
are introducing some of them to you.

[Dibussi Tande](http://www.dibussi.com/) is one of the leading English
bloggers from Cameroon. His blog, Scribbles from the Den is about his personal
view on people, places, issues, and events in Cameroon, Africa, and the world.
[He discusses what he calls “Biyaism”:  
](http://www.dibussi.com/2008/01/biyaism-without.html)

> After close to a year of subtle and not-so-subtle calls by members of the
> ruling CPDM for an amendment of Article 6(2) of the constitution of Cameroon
> which imposes presidential term limits, President Paul Biya finally took a
> stance on the debate last December 31. During his nationwide end-of-year
> address, Paul Biya backed the opponents of term limits by arguing that: “In
> fact, there are arguments for a revision, particularly of Article 6 which
> indeed imposes a limitation of the people’s will, a limitation which is out
> of tune with the very idea of democratic choice.”

[Bakweri ](http://www.bakweri.com/)is a group blog focusing on Bakweri culture
and society. [The blog celebrated the news](http://www.bakweri.com/2007/10/dr-
jem-spectar-.html) of a Cameroonian born new President of the University of
Pittsburgh:

> Dr. Jem Spectar who hails from Buea at the foot of Mt. Fako, South West
> Cameroon, was on Friday 28th September installed as the 5th President of the
> University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown in the United States.

[Bate Besong](http://www.batebesong.com/) is a special blog dedicated to the
life and works of the late Bate Besong, a well known Cameroonian social
critic. [Kelvin Ngong Toh looks at his
play](http://www.batebesong.com/2007/11/drama-and-polit.html), Beasts of No
Nation:

> Bate Besong is one of the most renown Cameroonian playwright of English
> expression, besides Bole Butake, Victor Epie Ngome and John Nkemngong, who
> is of the younger generation of Cameroonian playwrights in English. Even
> then, Bate Besong’s plays have not gained impetus in the eyes of critics.
> But examining the content and form of Beasts of no Nations, a play he
> published in 1990, one can rightly conclude that Bate Besong is an
> experimentalist playwright and a reformer.

[Fonlon.org](http://www.fonlon.org/) is a blog [celebrating Bernard
Fonlon](http://www.fonlon.org/2006/08/bernard_nsokika.html) who was described
by his contemporaries as “Socrates in Cameroon”:

> Twenty years ago, on 26th August 1986, Bernard Nsokika Fonlon died in
> Canada. He had gone there in the month of May of that year in order to
> receive a doctorate degree in Literature (D. Litt.) from the University of
> Guelph, and it was his intention to spend the 1986/1987 academic year in the
> United States of America, within the framework of a Fulbright programme. But
> the Lord, the Giver of Life, decided otherwise. Bernard died in Canada at
> the age of sixty-one years, and nine months and six days.

[Tangwa's pages](http://www.gobata.com/) is a blog by Godfrey Tangwa, a
prolific Cameroonian writer. His blog has not been updated for sometime,
though. He once wrote about [malaria research and
ethics](http://www.gobata.com/2005/04/malaria_researc.html):

> What has Ethics got to do with state-of-the-art malaria research and control
> efforts, let alone in Cameroon? If the word “Ethics” brings to your mind
> only images of churches and other places of worship, holy books and
> religious injunctions, priests, pastors and other preachers, all of which
> may seem rather far removed from science, let alone research, then this
> surely, is a pertinent question for you. Of course, religious people,
> religious discourse and religion generally are concerned with ethics or
> morality generally. But ethics or morality is quite distinct from religion
> and is or should be the concern of all human beings, be they religious or
> not.

[Francis B. Nyamnjoh](http://www.nyamnjoh.com/) is Associate Professor and
Head of Publications and Dissemination with the Council for the Development of
Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA). One of his recent posts is about
his latest novel, [Souls Forgotten](http://www.nyamnjoh.com/2008/01/souls-
forgotten.html):

> This novel is about coming of age and coming to terms in Mimboland. It is
> also about the fragility of life and the strength of the human spirit. The
> filth and screaming splendor of the city and the perplexed tranquility of
> the village are juxtaposed, as the tension and conviviality between
> tradition and modernity are lived and explored.

[Jacob Nguni](http://www.jacobnguni.com/) is a Cameroonian musician as well as
a blogger. He [writes about the popular African
song](http://www.jacobnguni.com/2004/12/sweet_mother_is.html), Sweet Mother:

> Sweet Mother by Prince Nico Mbarga has been voted Africa's favourite song by
> BBC readers and listeners.
>
> Chosen from a shortlist of 10, the 1976 hit celebrating motherhood won with
> more than 27% of the vote.
>
> The wedding song Vuli Nadlela by the wild child of South African music,
> Brenda Fassie, who died earlier this year, came in second.

[Mwalimu George Ngwane](http://www.gngwane.com) is a Cameroonian political and
social thinker. He mostly writes about social, cultural and political issues.
He recently wrote about [2007 being the year of heroism and martyrdom in
Africa:](http://www.gngwane.com/2008/01/2007-a-year-of.html)

> Heroism is the ability to triumph over adversity. Its kernel is fuelled by
> defiance and fired by a steel will.
>
> Either as an individual or a corporate body, heroism urges the subject to go
> against the grain of conservative establishment. Motivated by independent
> assertiveness, the subject breaks free from monolithism and complacency to
> embrace the collective vision of his or her society. Ali Mazrui says heroes
> are symbols of achievements; they are ultimate victors.
