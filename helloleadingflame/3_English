On Thursday, February 23, 2012, ten days before the March 4 presidential
election, the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin addressed thousands of
people at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. The Guardian's Miriam Elder
[described the event](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/23/putin-
addresses-thousands-moscow-rally) as “a gathering reminiscent of Soviet
spectacle both in rhetoric and style”:

> […] Thousands of workers from the provinces were bussed in or rushed on to
> trains to attend the event. […]

A number of Moscow-based bloggers attended the February 23 rally, too. Below
is a selection of their photo reports and observations, along with some of the
remarks from their audiences.

LJ user mi3ch [posted 17 photos and

> Absolutely ordinary people. Trusting. Good. Like my aunt. Like my next-door

LJ user otshellnica rebuked the blogger [ru] in the comments section:

> At Bolotnaya, you could find the same [unsmiling] faces in the multi-
> thousand crowd. Just as there were nice and smiling faces at this rally.
> You, of all people, shouldn't be playing with such cheap arguments.

LJ user maxsytch offered [ru] a different point of comparison between the
anti- and pro-Putin rallies:

> The difference was in the percentage of the people who came to Bolotnaya and
> Luzhniki voluntarily.

Ryazan-based LJ user tamrat elaborated [ru] on the definition of
‘voluntarily,’ citing her city's participation in the February 23 rally as an
example:

> People from Ryazan enterprises came voluntarily – and joyfully. And whether
> they are for Putin or not is irrelevant. They had a tour of Moscow for free!
> They were taken there, got fed, listened to a concert. And all this for
> free! People came back home happy. And nothing will change in our country
> until a person can be made happy with free food and a trip!

LJ user vova-maltsev [posted 14 photos](http://vova-
maltsev.livejournal.com/1565673.html) [ru] and recounted his quick
conversations with some of the rally's participants:

> […]
>
> \- Why are you here?  
>  – We've been brought in here, [damn it].  
>  – Are you for Putin?  
>  – [Screw him], our salary's 17,000 [rubles a month, $580].
>
> […]
>
> There were [Tajik migrant workers] sitting in one of the buses.  
>  – Are you for Putin?  
>  – [We work as cleaners in Izmailovo, damn it, and we are stuck here now.
> Will have to do our job all night.]
>
> […]
>
> Nice [female] school cooks.  
>  – What are you doing here?  
>  – We've been dispatched here.  
>  – To cook porridge [for the rally's participants]?  
>  – Yes.  
>  – Did you go to Bolotnaya?  
>  – No, they didn't send us there.  
>  – Are you for Putin?  
>  – Yes, of course… Are you a journalist?  
>  – Yes. I'm not for Putin.  
>  – (whispering) We are all against him. All our teachers are against, too.

An anonymous reader left this comment [ru] to LJ user vova-maltsev's post:

> [They are being drawn there forcefully.] They aren't even getting paid, the
> motivation is their fear of problems at work + 1 day off. This info is 100%
> true. Relatives work at a state enterprise, in Moscow.

LJ user panzicov (Alexei Vitvitskiy) [posted 48
photos](http://panzicov.livejournal.com/227499.html) [ru] on his blog. Five of
these photos, the blogger claims, show a group of people allegedly being paid
for their participation in the rally:

> […] The conscience of the people costs 800 rubles [$27] for two hours, [the
> money] was being handed out at [Park Kultury metro station] right after the
> rally. […]

Seven photos in LJ user panzicov's report show a group of young black men
carrying handmade banners with pro-Putin slogans on them. Another blogger, LJ
user drandin (Igor Drandin), talked with these men, asking them where they
were from, and posted the video [ru, en] [on his
blog](http://drandin.livejournal.com/353311.html) and [on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UjiruXYJXSA);
one of the men explained, in English, that they were from Kenya.

LJ user pier_luigi, commenting on LJ user panzicov's post, wrote this [ru]
about Putin's Kenyan supporters:

> North Korea this is not – not yet… But the representatives of international
> Putinism are very impressive!

LJ user tushinetc [posted 16
photos](http://tushinetc.livejournal.com/110692.html) [ru] taken before most
of the rally's participants took their seats at the Luzhniki Stadium. One of
the photos shows empty seats with identical plastic bags on them. LJ user
tushinetc explained:

> […] Some organizations took good care of their employees, making sure they
> do not get cold while sitting on plastic [seats]. In each bag placed on the
> seats there's a blanket, as well as a candy and a tangerine, and on the seat
> itself, there's [a cloth mat for sitting]. […]

LJ user 2014imeretinka commented [ru]:

> How mean! For a candy and a tangerine…

LJ user panfilosoff replied [ru]:

> Not mean at all… If you don't attend, you'll have serious problems at work,
> and if you do attend, you'll get a reward and a tangerine. Everything's
> simple and logical.
