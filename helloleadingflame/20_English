News about YouTube being
[blocked](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/09/22/koweit-to-block-
youtube-over-anti-muslim-videos/) in Kuwait hit the headlines yesterday, with
bloggers frustrated over what they described as yet another intrusion on
freedom of speech in their country.

The Kuwait Ministry of Communications first issued an order to local ISPs
[denying access to
Youtube](http://www.aljarida.com/aljarida/Article.aspx?id=78664) due to video
content considered [offensive to
Muslims](http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSLM28138520080922)
and Islam. Blogger later reported that the ban was lifted after YouTube
removed the ‘offensive’ video.

About the original ban,
[_Ansam_](http://ansam518.blogspot.com/2008/09/blocking-youtube.html) writes:

> Man this is ridiculous… no, no, no… its is ridiculously sad! Who comes up

> I am hating this SO MUCH! Ughhhhhhhhh!

And when the ban was not implemented, _Ansam_ exclaimed:

> They canceled! Its not blocked… YAY

Another Kuwaiti blogger, [_Loft965_](http://loft965.com/2008/09/22/kuwait-
quotidian-vol-6/), notes:

> It’s the end of the world as we know it: Kuwait might [block
> YouTube](http://blogallalong.com/2008/09/22/kuwait-blocking-youtube/).

[_Bashar_ ](http://blogallalong.com/2008/09/22/kuwait-blocking-youtube/) too
is livid at the decision, suggesting that the government bans other sites
while it is at it. His suggestions include:

> If they still wanna move forward, despite that YouTube did really act upon
> the video, listned to people complains, and there isn’t really any such
> videos right now, then I have a list of suggestions to push our country
> furter forward, carefully selected from[ Alexa top 100 sites in
> Kuwait](http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=KW&ts_mode=country&lang=none):
>
>   1. **Google** , **Yahoo** , and **MSN** Search: The head of search to all
> evil things. Block them.
>   2. **Facebook** : There are some athiest and anti-Islamic groups. Don’t
> try to reach them, educate them, or show your thoughts. Just leave the whole
> site.
>   3. **Maktoob.com** : Arabic online forums, e-marriage could be abused for
> dating, movies, horoscopes. This is not Islamic is it?
>   4. **Kooora.com** : All about soccer, mostly European soccer where teams
> show sponsored Beer and wine ads on their Shirts.
>   5. **RapidShare** : Sharing is not monitored, you can’t tell what your
> people are sharing. And someone might be secretly sharing offensive content.
> There must be some of it. Or at least, just to be on the safe side
>   6. **Travian.ae** : Obiously, why should you let your people play as
> Romanian soldiers in an online game, helping the Romanian empire expand it’s
> grounds online, when they could be fighting as Islamic ones.
>   7. **Hi5** : Friendship site.

[_Falantan_](http://negativity-sucks.blogspot.com/2008/09/on-blocking-youtube-
day-2.html) brings news of the order to ban YouTube being reconsidered at
higher levels. He writes:

> Thanks to you all and the amazing response, it seems the Ministry people are
> realizing their blunder […]And now I got confirmation that the Minister
> himself has convened with his department heads and rescinded the order.  
>  Thank you [_al-
> Jarida_](http://www.aljarida.com/aljarida/Article.aspx?id=78664) and thank
> you bloggers of Kuwait :)

Writing in Arabic,
[_Jandeef_](http://www.aljarida.com/aljarida/Article.aspx?id=78664) argues:

شبكة الانترنت فيها مواد تعليمية واقتصادية وتجارية وثقافية، لكن فيها مواقع
إرهابية وإباحية وعنصرية وغيرها … ليش ما تمنعونها؟  
السكين يمكن استخدامها لتقطيع تفاحة وقص كيكة عيد ميلاد وأكل ستيك، لكن هناك من
يقتل الناس فيها … ليش ما تمنعونها؟  
السيارة وسيلة نقل وفي بعض الأحيان وسيلة كشخة، ولكن هناك من يستخدمها للسرقة  
والتهريب، وأحياناً تتسبب بإصابة أحد أو فقد حياته … ليش ما تمنعونها؟

The Internet has educational, economic, commercial and cultural material, but
it also carries terrorist, immoral and racial material… why don't you ban it?  
A knife can be used to cut an apple or a birthday cake, as well as for eating
steak, but there are people who use it to kill… why don't you ban it?  
A car is a means of transportation and sometimes it is a means of showing off.
But there are some who use it rob others and smuggle, and sometimes it is
causes injuries and kills people… why don't you ban it?

Jordanian [_Moey_](http://moeys.net/2008/09/22/kuwait-blocks-youtube/), who
visits Kuwait regularly, urges the authorities:

> Why block the website? I’m not sure if any of you remember, they blocked
> anything +18 in Yahoo groups 2 years back, and YouTube has an option that
> allows users to report offensive content.
>
> Please don’t go nuts like Syria and block YouTube and Facebook?
