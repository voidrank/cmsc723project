This evening, vice-president Nicolás Maduro announced the death of the
president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez Frías.

President Chávez had been suffering from cancer since 2010 and had undergone
various treatments on the island of Cuba on at least 4 occasions. After
winning the elections on October 7th 2012, which secured his mandate from 2013
to 2019, he announced in December that he had to return to Cuba for another
operation. More than 80 days later, during which he did not appear in front of
the cameras, his health worsened as a result of respiratory complications and
the advance of the cancer.

Twitter users reacted immediately to Maduro's announcement.

Hugo Chávez governed Venezuela from 1999 until 2013. He won 4 presidential
elections and developed a new Constitution. His method of governance was known
around the world for its anti-imperialist ideology which was critical of the
United States, although his country continued to be a supplier of oil to the
US.

He also drove various proposals for regional integration in Latin America and
the Caribbean. At home, he dedicated a considerable part of his public policy
to favour the country's poorest classes through social investment funded by
the money brought by high oil prices during his years of government.

In Venezuela discussion of the [political
polarisation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/01/11/venezuela-legal-stand-
off-over-chavez-absence/) which has divided Venezuelans between pro- and anti-
Chavez for all these years is inevitable, making it more complex to understand
many of the things which happen due to the constant presence of two competing
perspectives. Despite this, the President's death is a time of national
mourning.
