The election crisis in Zimbabwe continues: there are reports from the
mainstream media, bloggers and human rights organisations about state
organised post-election violence against supporters of the opposition, the
main opposition leader, [Morgan
Tsvangirai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Tsvangirai), has left the
country for Botswana fearing for his life and the “ship of evil” continues to
draw bloggers’ attention.

**The Evil Ship**

[KOGY](http://townshipvibes.com/) calls [the Chinese ship carrying
weapons](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7368208.stm) destined for
Zimbabwe [“the evil ship”](http://www.townshipvibes.com/2008/04/cry-our-
beloved-zimbabwe.htm):

> As the evil ship carrying weapons of mass destruction is stranded in the
> South African coast, there are cries for ‘freedom’ everywhere in Zimbabwe
> today. The once prosperous country full of happy people has now turned into
> an unwanted hunger and disease stricken country. The economy is in shambles,
> the country is in crisis because the ruling party does not want to release
> the results of the elections which everyone else besides Zanu PF believe
> Mugabe lost. The Zimbabwe government has now turned to acquiring weapons of
> mass destruction, to destroyed the same people whom they want us to believe
> they voted for Mugabe to remain in power.

[Hope questions the
logic](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/882) of buying weapons
during “abnormal times”:

> Can a transaction in arms ever be considered ‘normal’ during abnormal times?  
>  I’m nothing more than a confused Zimbabwean, but I want to know what
> happens when the postman arrives at the door of Zimbabwe’s State House
> asking for the President to sign for the delivery… who signs for it?

[Who will come to Zimbabwes
aid](http://crybelovedzimbabwe.blogspot.com/2008/04/who-will-come-to-
zimbabwes-aid.html)?:

> Already the illegal government is busy buying arms from China either using
> aid money meant for ordinary Zimbabweans or mortgaging the country's natural
> resources for the exchange of arms that it intends to use on ordinary
> unarmed civilians whose sole crime is vote Mugabe and Zanu PF out of power.
> The Chinese vessel failed to offload its cargo in South Africa thanks to the
> members of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) who
> refused to offload the weapons and is said to be heading towards Angola or
> Namibia and we know Angola sides with Mugabe so as does Namibia and the
> world's superpowers should halt that consignment reaching a blood thirst
> dictator. If the world does not act now there will be catastrophe in
> Zimbabwe.

Sokwanele calls for action:  
[Send a Portuguese email to stop the ‘An Yue
Jiang’](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/893):

[Stop the An Yue Jiang](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/885)
from delivering Chinese weapons to Zimbabwe.

They [have posted](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/897) [a
petition](http://www.avaaz.org/en/no_arms_for_zimbabwe/2.php/?cl=78842915) by
[Avaaz](http://www.avaaz.org/en/), a gobal web movement, and have also
developed an [‘Action Contact
Database’](http://www.sokwanele.com/form/search_actioncontacts):

**Morgan Tsvangirai**

Following the reports that the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, [is not
planning to go back to Zimbabwe soon from
Botswana](http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1933560820080419), [Bev
Clark writes](http://kubatanablogs.net/kubatana/?p=531), “If I had my way I’d
put him on a shuttle and send him straight to Mars.”:

> I’ve read that Morgan Tsvangirai believes that shuttle diplomacy is the way
> to go right now. If I had my way I’d put him on a shuttle and send him

[Kubatana asked Zimbabweans to send their
views](http://kubatanablogs.net/kubatana/?p=569) about Tsvangirai's decision
to stay in Botswana. They texted their views to Kubatana:

**Post-Election Violence**

We are [going back to
war](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/895):

> The same person who sent us this message also advised us that someone he

>  The answer was, “Yes we are all being armed; we are going back to war”.

[There are torture
camps](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/879) set by Mugabe
supporters:

> In the Thursday edition of The Zimbabwean there were revelations that,
> “Militant supporters of President Robert have set up torture camps in parts
> of Mashonaland East province and stepped up a terror campaign against
> opposition activists in the province”.  
>  The reason for their deployment is to ensure a victory for Mugabe in their

>  Sokwanele is able to report that we are able to verify and endorse this
> information with a report leaked to us by a member of the defence forces.
> This was received yesterday.  
>  There are a variety of strategies being employed to hoodwink Zimbabweans,
> particularly those in the rural areas. What follows is a breakdown of the

[Coordinated state
violence](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/878) against
innocent civilians:

> It looks like a coordinated phase of Mugabe’s crackdown against human rights
> and opposition activists.  
>  In addition to the news of the arrests, we have received further
> information from a trusted source who says that the awful Obert Mpofu is up

> source sent us:  
>  Obert Mpofu, the ‘former’ Minister of International trade and Industry
> controls all the intimidation and violence in Matabeleland North. He was
> also indirectly implicated in the violent murder of Martin Olds on
> Independence Day in 2000.  
>  One of Mpofu’s main henchmen is Richard Moyo, the Zanu PF Chairman for Ward
> 8, Umguza.  
>  Moyo runs a store and beerhall on Cranmore farm, Umguza. He drives a new
> white Nissan King Cab with Zanu PF Umgusa District on the door.  
>  Moyo is very dangerous and has been known to murder anyone getting in his

[Hand amputations](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/911):

**Protests and Riots**  
Students at Bindura University of Science Education [protested last
week](http://kubatanablogs.net/kubatana/?p=565):

> There was mayhem in Bindura yesterday the 22nd of April 2008 when Bindura
> University of Science Education BUSE students joined other students at
> tertiary institutions countrywide in protesting against the illegal regime’s
> efforts to cling onto power despite losing the March 29 harmonised
> elections. The angry students stormed the streets at around 10am and marched
> from the new to the old campus site chanting protest songs. The march was
> disrupted by ruthless and brutal armed soldiers who forced the students to
> stop the protest and assaulted several students in the melee. This led to
> the arrest of three student leaders who were quickly whisked away and are to
> appear in court today charged under the notorious Public Order and Security
> Act (POSA).  
>  Last week saw the opening of tertiary institutions nationwide mounted by
> massive protests by aggrieved students who could not take lightly the
> exorbitant fee hikes and the illegal delay in releasing the just ended
> Presidential poll results. The students vowed to continue protesting until
> the illegal Government of Robert Mugabe swallows its pride, accept defeat
> and leave office.

[And there was a riot
](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/872)at the National
University of Science and Technology:

> There was a riot at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST)
> yesterday (16 April).  
>  We heard that several activist students called all the students from their
> lessons to start a boycott of classes until the Presidential results were
> released.  
>  There was a slow trickle of curious students out of their classes to see
> what was going on, and at about this point the riot police were called in.  
>  Things turned aggressive and the university was locked down. We believe
> that the activists have been arrested, but this fact has not yet been
> confirmed. The whereabouts of the student activists is unknown.  
>  The student situation in Zimbabwe has been very under-reported.

Simon “Dreadman” Mudekwa, the President of [the Zimbabwe Revolutionary Youth
Movement ](http://zimrevyouths.blogspot.com/) was arrested while protesting

**Anti-Zanu PF Tactics**  
Kubatana blog received [tips to counter Zanu PF
tactics](http://kubatanablogs.net/kubatana/?p=563):

> Here are some useful tips sent to us by a passionate man committed to

>  We need to counter Zanu PF tactics  
>  Communication Fliers, newspapers, rallies, SMS, emails, international media

**Government of National Unity**

Is there a need for [a government of National
Unity?](http://crybelovedzimbabwe.blogspot.com/2008/04/results-are-non-
negotiable.html):

> Now we hear that they want a government of national unity, based on what?
> They called the elections and lost what needs to be negotiated is the smooth
> transition of power to MDC the choice of the people. Even Zuma the South
> African Presidential hopeful's ideas of a negotiation between MDC and Zanu
> PF should be mooted, there is nothing to negotiate, we won the election, we
> are ready to govern. This whole idea of that Mugabe will steal this election
> and declare himself a victor rule for 18 months and then hand over power to
> Emmerson Mnangagwa who in turn will then instigate negotiations with MDC to
> resume the flow of international aid and perpetuate Zanu PF's stranglehold
> on Zimbabwe will be rejected by people of Zimbabwe and if needs be we will
> defend our vote violently. If I read carefully between the lines of the
> propaganda mouthpiece the Herald is that Mugabe and his military junta
> surely know that they cannot revive the economy of Zimbabwe, there want to
> give MDC piecemeal positions within their illegal government ignoring the
> outcome of the election.

[Hope asks](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/896), “Is this a
sign that Zanu PF are recognising they cannot simply steal the elections and
get away with it?”:

> The state controlled Herald (aka The Horrid) has an article today which
> proposes a government of National Unity lead by Robert Mugabe and outlines
> what they (read Zanu PF because The Herald is their mouthpiece) want SADC to
> do:  
>  The Zimbabwe Government and independent international observers are agreed
> that the just-ended harmonised elections did not produce an outright winner
> in the presidential race. It is unlikely that the on-going recount will
> substantively alter that position.  
>  Accordingly, it stands to reason that, the transitional government of
> national unity, negotiated by the two leading contending parties, under the
> mediation of Sadc, supported by the international community, should be led
> by the incumbent president.

**Confusing Collage of Symbols and Slogans**

Finally, [Comrade Fatso describes the streets of
Zimbabwe](http://comradefatso.vox.com/library/post/space-fillers.html):

> The streets are empty. The state has retreated. So has the opposition. All
> we are left with are their torn posters, pasted over each other in a
> confusing collage of symbols and slogans.
>
> We also have their space-fillers. Riot police aimlessly walk the streets,
> batons in belts like forgotten cellphones. Or sometimes unconsciously swung
> in the air like a stick-picked-up-on-a-path. They walk the streets like the
> thousands of unemployed H-town youths. Space-fillers. Like the pothole-
> filling youths who have taken over the suburban streets. Stopping traffic,
> asking for donations, filling potholes. Unhindered.
