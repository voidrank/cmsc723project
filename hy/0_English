The Knesset has [decided to freeze
legislation](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/146488)
regulating readers’ ability to respond to articles via the so-called
[“Talkback Law”](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2008/01/17/israel-
talkback-law-for-censorship-on-web-commenting-passes-initial-knesset-voting/),
in an effort to allow web sites to practice self-regulation. The Talkback Law,
submitted by MK Israel Hasson (Yisrael Beiteinu), passed its preliminary
reading. It would make web sites responsible for the talkbacks (user generated
comments) of its readers as though they were articles of the site itself.

Avner Finchuk of the Israeli Civil Rights Association, addresses the Knesset
legislators in an [article on
ynet](http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3542272,00.html):

> החוק לא נועד, וגם אינו יכול, לחנך את הציבור לנימוסים והליכות. אם רוצים
> המחוקקים בכנסת להשפיע על תרבות הדיון הציבורי, יתכבדו ויתחילו לעשות זאת בביתם
> ואל יפגעו בציפור נפשה של הדמוקרטיה.

“This law was not meant to educate the general public towards politeness and
manners. If the Knesset legislators want to have an influence on the public
conversation culture, they are welcome to begin to do this in their homes, not
harming the soul of our democracy.”

> נציגת משרד המשפטים, עורך דין תמר קלהורה, הביעה התנגדות להצעת החוק של חסון.
> לדבריה, אין להשתמש באמצעי החקיקה הקיימים לגבי מדיום חדש כמו האינטרנט אלא יש
> לבנות לו כלי חקיקה חדשים כמקובל בעולם. הצעת משרד המשפטים היא שברגע שתתקבל
> תלונה על תוכן גולשים. טוקבק או כל תוכן אחר האתר המארח יפנה לכותב, אם הכותב
> יודיע שהוא מתכוון להגן על התוכן בבית משפט, התוכן לא יוסר, אם הכותב לא יעשה
> זאת התוכן יוסר.

Lawyer Tamar Kalhura, representative from the Ministry of Justice, conveyed
her objection to Hasson's law proposal. She claims that the existing
legislative methods must not be used on such a new medium as the internet. It
is necessary to build new legislative tools, as is done around the world, she
continues. The Ministry of Justice proposes the following solution – when a
website receives a complaint on a talkback (comment) or any other (user
generated) content, the hosting site will contact the writer. If the writer
claims that he/she will protect the content in court, it will not be removed,
otherwise if the content writer does not respond, it will be removed.

From this proposal, it is not clear how content provided by anonymous sources
will be handled. [Yonatan Klinger](http://www.2jk.org/praxis/?p=1234) of 2jk
