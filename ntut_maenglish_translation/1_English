In Japan, [plastic models of food](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/sampuru/) are
common outside of just about every eatery. In order to provide potential
customers with information about exactly what's on the menu, _shokuhin
sanpuru_ (食品サンプル, “food samples”), or highly detailed replicas of every dish
served in the restaurant, are displayed near the entrance. Customers peruse
the food samples, and then decide to enter the shop or keep looking for
someplace to eat.

There is an entire industry devoted to creating these food samples. The Tokyo
neighborhood of Kappabashi is home to a cluster of these small businesses that
make plastic food samples, which German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in
his movie [Tokyo-Ga](https://youtu.be/9y2Ej3AZ4c0) more than 20 years ago.

While plastic food samples are so common in Japan as to be unnoticeable to
most Japanese people, there is a new trend in Japan to turn them into eye-
catching cellphone accessories and other knick-knacks. Writing on [Naver
Matome](https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2149494044968066501), blogger
[itinii](https://matome.naver.jp/mymatome/itinii) has collected [a variety of
social media links](https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2149494044968066501) with
photos of this twist on _shokuhin sanpuru_.

Food samples have been turned into a variety of kitschy collectibles
including, in this case, refrigerator magnets:

The food sample novelty boom is becoming increasingly more elaborate. In this
case, a _kaisen-don_ (a popular seafood rice bowl) has been transformed into a
smartphone stand.

And here, it's an apple that holds up your smartphone:

This is just the beginning of an increasing descent into whimsy. Some
smartphone stand and case designers allow you to create your own work of art,
in this case, by using _ikura_ , or salmon roe that is a popular topping
served with white rice. One Twitter user doubts:

>

> my smartphone case with salmon roe?” I think I'll be the only one.

The fake food accessory boom also can take perhaps less appetizing forms,
including gag items to startle coworkers and family members.

And to learn more about the original trend that started it all, this video
provides a glimpse of Kappabashi in Tokyo, a district devoted to supplying the
restaurant industry, including with _shokuhin sanpuru_.

As well as this video, which gives an overview of how Japanese food samples
are actually made.
