[Anjali Lama](https://www.instagram.com/anjali_lama_official/) is blazing a
trail in the fashion industry. She is slated to become the first transgender
model from Nepal to walk the runways of the prestigious [Lakme Fashion
Week,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakme_Fashion_Week) which will take place
in Mumbai in February.

about the news:

Lama was born male and given the name Navin Waiba (‚ÄòNavin‚Äô means new in
Nepali). She [grew up far away from the glitz and glamour of the fashion
industry in a village in Nepal‚Äôs
Nuwakot](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/12/30/a-transgender-model-will-
walk-the-ramp-at-the-lakme-fashion-week/) district, not having the faintest
inkling about what modelling was because of living in such a rural area.

She said she always had the feeling that [she was a girl on the
inside](http://khabar.jp/2015/03/my-aim-to-be-super-model/), and liked to do
make-up and look pretty from an early age. It was only when she landed in
Kathmandu for higher education that she came in contact with the [Blue Diamond
Society](http://www.bds.org.np/), an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender (LGBT) rights, and found the real person inside her ‚Äî a
[20-year wait](http://www.infomala.com/anjali-lama/).

She then got into modelling, and now she's on track to make history.

On Facebook, Rochelle Pinto [praised the fashion
world](https://www.facebook.com/rochelle.pinto.9/posts/10154996828408729) for
welcoming Lama:

> 10 points for inclusiveness. Contrary to what you may think, fashion remains
> one of the most supportive spaces, happily accepting the world's weirdos,
> rebels and rejects.

In 2007, Nepal‚Äôs Supreme Court entitled citizens to [select their gender
identity](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-
network/2016/feb/12/trans-rights-meet-the-face-of-nepals-progressive-third-
gender-movement) based on their own feelings. Nepal‚Äôs Election Commission
allows voters to identify as male or female or register themselves as a third
gender. Recently, Nepal [issued a special
passport](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nepal-issues-first-transgender-passport-
lgbt-activist-1514971) under the transgender category (listed as ‚ÄúO‚Äù for
‚ÄúOther‚Äù) to LGBT activist Monica Shahi.

In spite of so much progress, Nepali society still views members of the LGBT
community with suspicious eyes. Lama‚Äôs family and friends, for example, didn‚Äôt
support her at the beginning. However, her hard work has paid off and now she
is experiencing more and more acceptance.

For now, the news of Lama walking in Lakme Fashion Week has gone viral,
particularly in Indian media.
