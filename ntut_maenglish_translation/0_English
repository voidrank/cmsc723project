If you've ever wanted to explore the streets of Japan from the perspective of
a pedestrian, YouTube vlogger
[Rambalac](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAcsAE1tpLuP3y7UhxUoWpQ) is for
you. A non-Japanese resident of Japan, Rambalac has uploaded dozens of videos
taken on walks throughout the Tokyo area as well as other parts of Japan.

His most popular video, ‘Walking in Tokyo Shibuya at night’ has so far racked
up more than 1.8 million views:

“Not a vlog, no intrusive faces or talking, pure Japan only,” states Rambalac
as in introduction to all of his videos. He simply walks the streets of Japan
recording his videos with a [Panasonic Lumix
GH5](https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/lumix-
interchangeable-lens-ilc-cameras/DC-GH5KBODY.html) mirrorless camera mounted
on a [Zhiyun Crane V2 gimbal stabilzer](http://rambalac-
en.blogspot.com/2017/07/testing-new-zhiyun-crane-v2-zhiyun.html). There is no
background music and no commentary, although Rambalac will sometimes ask his
subjects for permission to keep filming.

On his [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/rambalac), Rambalac says:

> I started filming my walks just for fun and additional reason to go outside.
> I do not talk, except to people in front of me, or show my face, I prefer
> minimum editing and no sound effects. Somehow videos got popular, more
> popular than I expected. Recently I even started streaming that walks for
> real time feedback trying to make videos better.

While many of Rambalac's walking videos feature Tokyo, he also travels to
other parts of Japan. Here he takes an early autumn walk through Gion, a
popular tourist and cultural district on the east side of Kyoto:

Here, Rambalac gets out of the city to explore Amanohashidate, one of Japan's
“[three scenic views](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3990.html)” in a rural,
remote part of Kyoto prefecture:
