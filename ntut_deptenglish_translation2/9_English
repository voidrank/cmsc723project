On October 31, 2018, the Chinese government released a
[statement](http://english.gov.cn/policies/latest_releases/2018/10/29/content_281476367121088.htm)
declaring the reversal of a 25-year ban on the use of tiger bones and rhino
horns, making it legal to use parts “obtained from the animals in captivity
for scientific, medical and cultural purposes”.

The Chinese State Council said that powdered forms of rhino horn and bones
from dead tigers could be used in “qualified hospitals by qualified doctors”.
The animal products must be obtained from authorized farms, and animal parts
classified as “antiques” can be used in “cultural exchanges if approved by the
cultural authorities”.

The announcement worries conservationists who predict an upsurge in demand for
rhino horns in an already active black market plagued by poaching.

Just last month in Zimbabwe, it was reported that [poachers gunned down four
black rhinos](https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/10/poachers-gun-down-another-
black-rhino) within a two-month period. The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife
Management Authority suspects the same group of poachers in all three
incidents. However, no arrests have been made. Poaching has strained the
capacity of Zimbabwe's under-resourced national parks, rendering them
vulnerable to attackers.

On Twitter, wildlife advocate Sharon Hoole posted a gory photo of a mutilated
rhino and laments:

> So sad! Our wildlife soldiers must remain vigilant. The country is burning.
> Lawlessness is high. Wildlife crimes with impunity on the rise. Greedy
> wildlife ranchers and rangers selling out. Who will stand for life?

China's announcement was a [major blow to
conservationists](https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/in-a-blow-to-wildlife-
china-lifts-a-ban-on-the-use-of-tiger-and-rhino-parts) in Zimbabwe who already
face a severe lack of financial resources due to the nation's [deepening
economic crisis](https://mg.co.za/article/2018-10-31-economic-crisis-deepens-
in-zimbabwe).

As newly elected president Emmerson Mnangagwa struggles to implement
structural reforms, the nation is grappling with the news that former first
lady Grace Mugabe (wife of the deposed Robert Mugabe) was suspected to be
involved in an illicit ivory trade ring at the highest levels of government.
Within months of assuming power, Mnangagwa publicly [stressed conservation
efforts](https://www.iapf.org/president-mnangagwa-announcement/) as part of
his new government’s narrative in opposition to Grace Mugabe as a [“corrupt
ivory smuggler.”](https://theconversation.com/how-grace-mugabe-poaching-
claims-benefit-zimbabwes-new-president-94766)

Yet, conservationists say they still lack the financial resources required to
increase security and boost capacity to monitor and track poachers in
Zimbabwe's national parks. They fear that China's partial policy reversal on
the 25-year ban will only make matters worse.

Zimbabwe hosts the world's fourth largest black rhino population. Organized
groups of poachers are known to mutilate rhinos’ faces when extracting their
horns, leaving them to die a slow and painful death.

Some conservationists are calling this a war against black rhinos, not just in
Zimbabwe, but in all four countries where black rhinos roam [“critically
endangered”](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eight-endangered-black-
rhinos-died-their-way-sanctuary-180969638/) as classified by the World
Wildlife Fund. Without urgent intervention, they could vanish into extinction.
