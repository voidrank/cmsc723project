Bushfires in Queensland and flooding rains in Sydney have raised online debate
in Australia about the impact of climate change on extreme weather conditions.

On Wednesday, 28 November 2018, record temperatures in central Queensland
resulted in 200 fires, which some classified as
[catastrophic](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-28/queensland-bushfires-
gracemere-deepwater-rules-beach-baffle-blog/10561514). Eight thousand people
were evacuated from the town of Gracemere just near the regional center of
Rockhampton.

Further south, a month’s rainfall
[inundated](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-28/sydney-weather-storms-
disrupt-roads-and-morning-commute/10560198) Sydney on the same day, with 100
millimetres (4 inches) recorded in just two hours. There was widespread
flooding and property damage, as well as two reported deaths. One ‘mini-
cyclone’ tore off the side of a building.

Despite the [sunburnt
county](https://www.dorotheamackellar.com.au/archive/mycountry.htm)’s
reputation for “droughts and flooding rains”, many Australians were quick to
blame climate change for the exceptional events:

Not all agreed. Some argued that isolated weather events are not proof of a
connection. A tweet by news website new.com.au brought this response:

Melanie Elron was more concerned with the big picture:

The Australian government’s action, or inaction, has been a hot topic in
recent times. Coincidentally, the United Nations released a report on the same
day. According to the [Climate
Council](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/un-report-australia-not-
on-track-to-meet-paris-target/):

> A NEW UNITED NATIONS report has found that Australia, along with countries
> such as Saudi Arabia and the United States, is not on track to meet its 2030
> Paris climate target.

Jonathan Meddings lays the blame squarely on the politicians (aka ‘pollies’
down under):

> Record fires in Queensland. Record rain in Sydney. Record drought in parts
> of the east coast. This what
> [#climatechange](https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> looks like. While Queensland is burning, the east coast is parched & Sydney
> is drowning, most pollies have their heads in the sand. Not good enough.

Meanwhile, students are taking action of their own with many skipping classes
to attend [Student Strike for Climate
Action](https://www.smh.com.au/education/school-students-on-mass-strike-to-
protest-climate-change-inaction-20181129-p50j4c.html) rallies around the
nation:

Their action has certainly fired up Prime Minister Scott Morrison who called
for “less activism in schools and more learning”. Many on social media took
the side of the students:

Climate change is shaping up as a major issue at next year's Federal election
in Australia expected in May.
