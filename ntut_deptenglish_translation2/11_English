The Angolan President João Lourenço held formal talks with civil society
organizations, journalists and activists critical of the government on
December 4 at the Presidential Palace in an unprecedented move for a head of
state in that country.

The meeting appears to signal a pivot from his predecessor José Eduardo dos
Santos, who presided over Angola since its independence in 1975, and whose
administration became notorious for its ill-treatment of activists,
journalists, and [international
NGOs](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/angola-victory-for-civil-
society-as-court-strikes-down-ngo-law/).

João Lourenço was elected in September 2017 after succeeding Santos in the
ruling MPLA party's leadership and has since announced broad reforms, from the
economy to the media, as well as
[purged](https://globalvoices.org/2018/11/30/former-angolan-president-jose-
eduardo-dos-santos-accused-of-corruption-by-his-successor/) several high-level
officials connected with the Santos family.

Among the invitees to the Palace on December 4 were journalist [Rafael
Marques](https://globalvoices.org/2018/08/06/landmark-ruling-in-angola-
acquits-journalist-rafael-marques-of-all-charges/) and rapper Luaty Beirão,
who both made international headlines in 2015 and 2018 after they were
charged, in separate cases, with “insulting public authorities” and “planning
acts of rebellion” respectively, among other charges.

In June 2015, Beirão was arrested along with 16 other activists during a group
study session of the book “From dictatorship to democracy: A conceptual
framework for liberation,” by Gene Sharp. In March 2016, they all received
jail sentences varying between [two and eight
years](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/case-history-angola-15#case-
update-id-2478), which were converted to house arrest three months later.

Marques faced the courts in June 2017 for an
[article](https://www.makaangola.org/2016/10/procurador-geral-da-republica-
envolvido-em-corrupcao/) he wrote in 2016 alleging that then-Attorney General
João Maria de Souza had engaged in corrupt dealings to acquire a sizeable
beachfront property. He was acquitted of all charges in July 2018. His
journalistic work on corruption has landed him in jail several times since
1999.

Luaty Beirão recalled his ordeal on Twitter before the meeting with João
Lourenço.

> Disseram que queria dar golpe de estado,  
>  Retirar do trono o Zé,  
>  instalar-me no Palácio  
>  Respondi:  
>  A única forma de algum dia entrar nesse mambo  
>  Será pelo portão da frente  
>  Como ilustre convidado.

> They have said that I wanted to stage a coup,

On the eve of the meeting, Rafael Marques wrote on the website Maka Angola, of
which he is the founder and editor:

The meeting generated several reactions on social media. For [Esmael
Munhogo](https://www.facebook.com/esmael.muhongo/posts/2221623988075492), a
student at the University Institute of Angola, it marks a ”new era” for
Angola:

> Encontro de João Lourenço com Membros Da Sociedade Civil! Gostei da
> iniciativa do presidente! Ontem eles eram vistos como criminosos por
> defenderem o povo, hoje são vistos como grandes defensores da verdade.

> The meeting of João Lourenço and members of civil society! I liked the
> president's initiative! Yesterday they were seen as criminals for defending
> the people, today they are seen as great defenders of the truth.

Others don't think it necessarily represents a change:

Some Angolans stressed that they want concrete actions to change the country's
economic and social situation. [Luís

Other people present at the meeting were José Patrocínio, leader of the Omunga
Religious Association, Alexandra Semeão of Handeca Association and Maria Lúcia
Silveira of the Justice, Peace, and Development Association. Speaking with the
press after the meeting, they said they were “allowed to express all concerns
candidly and without apprehension”, [according to SAPO
