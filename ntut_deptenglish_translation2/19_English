This is not a victory gesture. A raised fist is a sign that rescuers make to
invite those around to hold silence and listen for signs of life from
survivors. [Image ](https://juantadeo.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sismo-cdmx-

The [strong earthquakes](https://globalvoices.org/2017/09/21/mexico-
earthquake-i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-when-pieces-of-the-ceiling-began-to-
fall/) that shook central and southwest Mexico September 2017 (one on the 7th
and another on 19th) have brought out a real [strength and
solidarity](https://globalvoices.org/2017/09/22/the-earthquake-that-revealed-
mexicos-strength-and-solidarity/) in the country's people. This has been
visible not only in terms of the waves of volunteers who have taken to the
streets of the capital to remove debris and donate supplies, but also in terms
of netizens capturing and sharing images from an event that has left the
country in shock.

Several people collaborated on a collection of photos documenting the
devastation and subsequent aid effort. Among them are photographer [Santiago
Arau](http://www.milenio.com/cultura/laberinto/fotografia_aerea-santiago_arau-
dron-ciudad_de_mexico-fotos_desde_el_cielo-entrevista_0_1036696602.html) and
mountain climber [Raul Morales](http://freeman.com.mx/author/raul/).

Arau has shared numerous photos via Instagram, also left photos for those who
wish to use them through the site [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/). Raúl
Morales has shared the images through
[Google](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOELKOY-

Below Global Voices reviews some of the most evocative and representative
images captured by the pair.

In this photo taken during the first hours of the disaster, Raúl Morales shows
civilian volunteers along with members of Mexico’s Navy starting rescue work
at a collapsed building .

Day and night the rescue work was carried out at the destroyed buildings, as
shown in this image of a property in the south of Mexico City.

The material destruction has still not been quantified yet. Not only are homes
effected, but also hundreds of automobiles.

“Anonymous Heroes”, is perhaps the best way to describe the citizens who took
responsibility for starting rescue work after the tragedy.

This image gives us an idea of the sea of people that came to the collapsed
zones, the majority with the intention of helping, others just as spectators,
but all sharing hurt and shock over the scenes they were witnessing.
