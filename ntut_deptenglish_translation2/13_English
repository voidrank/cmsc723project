Dozens of activists protested on 10 June outside the flagship restaurant of
[Maxim's Group ](https://www.maxims.com.hk/en/about/cat_01_a.asp)in Hong Kong
against the selling of shark fin soap in its restaurants’ menus.

The protesters, a number of whom were children, wore finless shark costumes
splattered with red paint and chanted, “When the buying stops, the killing can
too”. Photos of their demonstration were shared on Twitter.

Hong Kong is the world’s center in shark fin trade, accounting for about half
of the global shark fin trade every year. The demand for shark fin soup at
Chinese banquets is behind the [finning of 73 million of
sharks](http://www.wwf.org.hk/en/whatwedo/oceans/saying_no_to_shark_fin/)
every year. Currently around a quarter of the world's shark and ray species
are threatened with extinction.

While a survey in 2015 indicated that [94 percent of the
respondents](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-
environment/article/2020985/why-politics-stubborn-tastes-and-resilient) did
not want to consume the threatened species, local restaurants have refused to
take the luxurious dish off their menus. In most cases, consumers are
compelled to choose the restaurants’ set menus for their wedding or festival
banquets, which usually include shark fin soup. As indicated in the Hong Kong
Shark Foundation’s survey, which covered 375 Chinese restaurants in the city,
[98 percent](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-
environment/article/1905257/shark-fin-soup-still-served-98-cent-hong-kong) had
shark fin soup on their 2016 Lunar New Year menus.

Maxim is one of the largest restaurant groups in Hong Kong and operates more
than [980 restaurant outlets](https://www.maxims.com.hk/en/about/cat_01_a.asp)
in Hong Kong, China, Vietnam and Cambodia. The majority of its high-end
Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong are serving shark fin soup.

A petition demanding the restaurant group to stop selling shark fin soup
[explained](https://secure.avaaz.org/en/petition/Michael_Wu_Chief_Executive_Officer_Maxims_Catering_Limited_Maxims_Restaurants_in_Hong_Kong_STOP_Selling_Shark_Fin_Soup/)
the rationale behind the protest:

> The company has been resisting calls to drop shark fin soup from their set
> menus, ignoring the will of many good Hong Kong people who are against this
> cruel and unsustainable tradition.  
>  Maxim's claim they only serve shark fin soup made from blue sharks, but
> according to recent scientific evidence, blue shark populations around the
> world are being wiped out by greedy overfishing.  
>  Is Maxim's going to wait until blue sharks go extinct before it admits that
> there is a problem?  
>  Maxim's has a firm responsibility to end this practice to save sharks and
> the marine environment by immediately removing shark fin from all its menus,
> especially its set menus. Just as Hong Kong consumers have a responsibility
> to stop eating shark fin, restaurant groups like Maxim's also have an equal
> responsibility to stop selling it.

WildAid Hong Kong, the animal right organization behind the anti-shark fin
protests, also alleged that it is easy to order endangered shark species, like
whale shark, basking shark and silky shark — which are listed on Appendix II
of the international Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) — in Hong Kong restaurants “upon request”.

Hong Kong is a signatory to the CITES and according to the treaty, endangered
species listed on Appendix II “must be controlled in order to avoid
utilization incompatible with their survival”.

The group pointed out in their [Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/WildAidHK/videos/1482126391851269/):

> Despite claims by Maxim's management that it serves only blue sharks in its
> restaurants, the undercover footage demonstrates that the chain privately
> offers other more ‘exotic’ species. These are usually made available by
> restaurant staff acting autonomously of management to please their more
> demanding clientèle. Laxity and poor transparency is endemic across Hong
> Kong's Chinese restaurant industry, and supply chain secrecy is a problem in
> Hong Kong's notoriously crime-riddled shark fin trade.
