Evidence discovered on Fraser Island located in Queensland, Australia,
suggests there may have been [Aboriginal inhabitants as far back as 5,000
years
ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island#History_and_settlement). The
traditional owners of this land, the Butchulla people, called the island with
its incredible natural surroundings _K'gari_ meaning “paradise.”

However, the Buchulla people faced hardships after the arrival of colonizers,
who eventually displaced them from their land.

The Butchulla language also suffered during this time, almost leading to its
extinction in the 20th century due to governmental policies and missionary
groups that prohibited it.

Thanks to present-day revitalization efforts by the Butchulla Language
Program, the language is now returning. The program has produced new resources
such as [dictionaries
](https://books.google.com.bo/books/about/Dictionary_of_the_Butchulla_Language.html?id=z9GutgAACAAJ&hl=en)music
CDs, and organized activities, such as [language
courses](http://www.frasercoast.qld.gov.au/libraries/-/asset_publisher/Mjp4/content/butchulla-
language-classes-to-start-at-hervey-bay-libra-1) at local libraries, all of
which is helping to encourage younger generations to take an interest in it.

Digital media and the Internet are also playing a role in these revitalization
efforts. As part of the ABC Open project “[Mother
Tongue](https://open.abc.net.au/explore?projectId=95&sortBy=interest&isFeatured=0)”
in which local communities partner with video producers from the Australia
Broadcasting Corporation to create participatory videos focusing on Aboriginal
language revitalization.

One such video collaboration took place between Joyce Bonner, a community
linguist with the [Korrawinga Aboriginal
Corporation](http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/atsi/languages/centres/korrawinga)
in Hervey Bay area, and ABC Open producer [Brad
Marsellos](https://open.abc.net.au/people/2452). Together they created this
video sharing a traditional [Butchulla
lullaby](https://open.abc.net.au/explore/51938) sung by Bonner's own mother.

The team also collaborated to produce another

These videos are one part of the strategy to revitalize the Butchulla
language. Read an interview with Bonner

recipe for success of the Butchulla Language Program.
