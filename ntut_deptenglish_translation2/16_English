On 23 August, [Djuena Tikuna ](https://www.facebook.com/DjuenaTikuna/)became
the first indigenous singer to perform on the stage of the [Teatro
Amazonas](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Amazonas) (“Amazonas Theatre”)
— a bastion of European culture in the middle of the world’s largest tropical
forest.

The 32-year-old artist produced and starred in the launch of her work
Tchautchiüãne, or ‘my village’ in the Tikuna language. The album was inspired
by the [Amazonian rubber
boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rubber_boom), which saw the massive
exploitation of the region's rubber trees — and the region's people —
beginning at the turn of the 20th century.

The state of [Amazonas
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazonas_\(Brazilian_state\))has one of the
largest indigenous populations, making up [around
17%](http://mundoeducacao.bol.uol.com.br/geografia/a-populacao-indigena-no-
brasil.htm) of the 896,000 indigenous people currently live in Brazil.

Djuena is from the Tikuna people — Brazil’s largest indigenous ethnic group –
and identifies as a “singer of the indigenous movement”. According to Djuena,
the Tikuna are a “very musical” people; she learned from her mother, who
learned from her grandmother, who, in turn, learned from her ancestors.

Her lyrics are full of activist spirit; they speak of matters dear to her
community, such as the environment and the demarcation of lands. More
importantly, she sings in the Tikuna language, which, [for
her](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2017/08/1912133-pela-primeira-vez-
artista-indigena-e-protagonista-no-teatro-amazonas.shtml), is a political
choice:

> Alguns povos não falam mais a sua língua. Já pensou se canto em português?
> Os jovens que estão me assistindo vão querer me imitar. Mesmo na cidade,
> temos de manter a língua e a identidade.

> Some peoples no longer speak their language. Can you imagine if I sang in
> Portuguese? The youth who are watching me will want to imitate me. Even in
> the city, we have to keep our language and identity.

To understand what her show means for Brazil’s indigenous peoples, it is
useful to look at the history of the Teatro Amazonas itself.

The building, in central [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus), the
capital of Amazonas state, was designed by the Portuguese Institute of
Engineering and Architecture of Lisbon and inaugurated in 1896, at the peak of
rubber exploitation in the region.

In an era when the automobile industry was taking its first steps, the
discovery of extracting rubber from the
[_seringueira_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hevea_brasiliensis) trees —
commonly found in the Amazon — proved to be an extremely lucrative business,
and attracted hordes of investors, adventurers, and workers from other parts
of Brazil.

The industry used indigenous techniques to extract natural rubber from the
trees, and the wealth it generated turned the state capitals of northern
Brazil into some of the country’s richest. As a show of this new wealth, the
local elite proposed and financed the construction of the Teatro Amazonas — a
project which was actually built by indigenous workers.

The conversion of many indigenous people into poor workers was not the only
damage done by the rubber boom; this period was characterized by the mass
expulsion of various tribes from their lands.

121 years has passed since indigenous workers built the Teatro Amazonas, and
for the first time, an indigenous performer took to the stage of one of that
era’s most important landmarks.

When still a child, Djuena left the village and went to live in Manaus. In a
piece reported by the website Jornalistas Livres, she says the idea to take
her show to the Teatro Amazonas came from a question she asked herself: “Why
can't I sing there? Because I'm indigenous?”

She adds:

> Quando eu cantei no palco do Teatro Amazonas com eles, que nós batemos os
> pés, é uma forma de eu estar dizendo: estamos aqui, parentes. Vocês sofreram
> por causa dessa construção, mas nós estamos aqui, vamos continuar aqui
> lutando e vamos continuar aqui resistindo.

> When I sang on the stage of the Teatro Amazonas with them, and we beat our
> feet, it is a way of me saying: we are here, kinsmen. You suffered because
> of this building, but we are here, we will continue fighting here and
> resisting here.

The video ends with calls of “Demarcação já!” (“[Land] demarcation now!”)
which is part of

atacados-pela-policia-em-brasilia-artistas-lancam-musica-em-defesa-da-causa) —
including a protest [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbMzdkaMsd0)
released by artists earlier this year — to defend remaining indigenous lands
by ensuring full legal recognition, an issue which has been further weakened
under Brazil's current president [Michel
Temer’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Temer)s government.
