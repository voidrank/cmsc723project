In Afghanistan, deliberate disinformation circulated by authorities and poor
media practices are fuelling hate speech.

On November 25, hundreds of Hazara demonstrators took the streets of Daykundi,
Bamiyan, Mazar-e Sharif, Herat, Ghor and Kabul to
[protest](https://www.tolonews.com/index.php/afghanistan/protests-turn-
violent-over-arrest-local-commander) against the arrest of the militia
commander Alipoor, whose forces have been fighting Taliban militants across
central Afghanistan. ~~  
~~

The protest came after the government failed to respond quickly to deadly
attacks launched by Taliban militants [on three districts populated by the
minority.](https://globalvoices.org/2018/11/20/how-negligence-helped-the-
taliban-plunge-one-of-afghanistans-last-peaceful-regions-into-chaos/)

In an interview, Alipoor, who is branded a “criminal” by his critics and a
“people's defender” by supporters,
[said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SimBlAne3gE&amp=&feature=youtu.be):

> When the government fails to protect and defend people, it's our natural
> right to defend ourselves. People voted for them and supported them to run
> the government, so they can enforce the law and run a strong administration,
> but they failed. Nobody is feeling safe. When there is no security, then
> there is no government. We need justice, security and stability so that
> people can live their lives. For this reason such a government, that is not
> able to guarantee its own security, cannot ask me why I am armed.

Alipoor was released from custody on November 26, but only after the protest
in Kabul had already turned violent. Afghan officials said dozens of police
were wounded by rocks and some police checkpoints were burned. Alipoor's
arrest was ordered by the country's Attorney General. **

November 26 by Etilaatroz, one of Afghanistan's most important newspapers,
shows policemen appearing to shoot into a crowd of unarmed protestors.

The deputy interior minister claimed no-one was killed during the protest even
as gory [photos](https://twitter.com/ZDaryabi/status/1066979980750585856) of
protesters shot in the head and young school girls killed circulated online.

At least four people were
[killed](https://twitter.com/FrudBezhan/status/1067050351776489472) in Kabul
according to multiple media accounts, with 22 wounded. In
[Bamiyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=OCazj-

After the demonstration, more than 80 people were
[arrested](https://etilaatroz.com/68850/barmak-says-demonstration-in-kabul-is-

among them girls and children aged between 8 and 16.

Alipoor’s case has divided the Afghan public. This strong polarization of
opinions mirrors the social, political and ethnic fragmentation which is
deepening in Afghanistan against a background of everyday insecurity.

Such a setting offers fertile conditions for misinformation to sprout and
intensify inter-group hate speech.

## Fake news enters the fray

At a [meeting](https://etilaatroz.com/68801/us-forces-and-resolute-support-
rejected-arrest-of-alipoor/) with Afghan vice-president Sarwar Danish on
November 24, National Directorate of Security chief Massoum Stanekzai said
that Alipoor was arrested by the Americans and then handed over to Afghan
intelligence.

After this information began to circulate online, a spokesman for US forces in
the country [took to
Twitter](https://twitter.com/USFOR_A/status/1066762580570636288) to deny any
involvement in the case on Washington's part.

Other disinformation came directly from generally well-regarded media outlets,
such as RFE/RL's Afghan service, Azadi.

A number of social media users indicated that the service had used a Reuters
photo from 2016 to illustrate an article about this month's protests. The
photo shows injured policeman being transported by a military vehicle and was
taken after a bombing in Kabul.

In an online environment characterised by bitter vitriol, humour is an
antidote.

The massive spread of fake news on the back of the Alipoor protests pushed
some users to turn to creative irony:

> Scientists believe the latest protest organized in Kabul has increased the
> level of air pollution and is the main cause of this year's drought in
> northwestern AFG. When asked how, scientists blamed Iran for providing
> Hazaras with unknown sophisticated
