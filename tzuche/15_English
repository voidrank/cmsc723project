The last speaker of the ancient Bo language, Boa Senior, [has
died](http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5509) in her native [Andaman
Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Islands) (part of India) in
February 2010. It's a vivid confirmation of last year's report from UNESCO,
warning that [2,500 languages are at risk of
disappearing](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/02/20/worldwide-2500-languages-
disappearing/).

In her Minnesota-based _[True to
Words](http://truetowords.blogspot.com/2010/02/death-of-boa-sr-and-bo-
language.html) _blog devoted “to the exploration of language and writing,”
Sara Duane reports the news and adds that some formerly dead languages have
recently revived:

> In 1992 a prominent US linguist predicted that by the year 2100, 90% of the
> world's languages would have ceased to exist. One of those languages died
> last month when 85-year-old Boa Sr. passed away. She was the last speaker of
> Bo, which at 70,000 years was one of the world's oldest.

> Languages can be brough back from the brink, or even from total extinction,
> if the will is strong enough and most importantly, if enough of it has been
> written down. Hebrew was a dead language at the beginning of the 19th
> century. It existed as a scholarly written language, but there was no way to
> know how the words were pronounced. Persistence and will from Israeli Jews
> brought the language back into everyday use. There has also been a revival
> of Welsh in the UK and Maori in New Zealand.

_[Transubstantiation](http://transubstantiation.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/accidental-
death-of-a-language/)_ , which described itself as trying to “make sense of
the legacy of the Tower of Babel,” suggests documenting dying languages:

> If we are able to preserve language life then by all means let us preserve
> it. However, sometimes this is not possible and then perhaps our most
> important task as linguists is to analyse, describe and document; set the
> dying language down so that we can use knowledge about it to further
> research into the general understanding of the human condition.

_[Madhu Baganiar](http://madhubaganiar.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/with-boa-die-
tribe-tongue/)_ , who belongs to the indigenous Oraon (Kurukh) community
comments on the demise of Bo language with the death of Boa senior:

> Every language has its own unique history, culture style, story. When a
> language dies, a vast store house of knowledge associated with the language
> also dies. Today, a living tribal language “Bo” has died. Tomorrow more
> tribal languages of India are bound to die. There are hundred of reasons
> which will kill the living tribal language…

Ireland-based blogger _[The Poor
Mouth](http://thepoormouth.blogspot.com/2010/02/death-marks-loss-of-another-
language.html) _ mourns the loss of Bo, and says:

> Languages come and languages go – we can see the traces of several lost
> languages in the British Isles (Yola, Norn, Cumbric etc) – but I can’t help
> feel that when they die something significant is lost from the rich, dark
> soup that makes up humanity. Boa’s passing diminishes us all.
