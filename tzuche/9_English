At around 7:30 pm on Saturday (February 13, 2010) a bomb blast at a restaurant
popular with tourists in India's western city of Pune [killed 9 people and
left 57 people
injured](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hmNDTQjWDf0Mwih0lCo1mTG7fj2wD9DRMPT00).
The bomb was in a backpack and it exploded when an waiter tried to inspect the
left luggage. _Shashi Bellamkonda_ at _My Digital Thoughts_
[reports](http://readythoughts.blogspot.com/2010/02/pune-blasts-message-to-
world-is-to.html):

> A few hours ago (Feb 13th 2010) a bomb went off popular cafe ‘[German

_Shashi_ has also these observations:

_Pragmatic Euphony_
[warns](http://pragmatic.nationalinterest.in/2010/02/14/responding-to-pune/):

> The jehadis have struck again on the Indian mainland; this time in Pune,
> albeit more than a year after the horrendous terror attacks on Mumbai in
> November 2008. The initial response, while going with the most plausible and
> popular assumption that the blast was the handiwork of Pakistan based jehadi
> groups, is one of indignation. Perhaps understandably so as tempers are
> bound to run high. And this emotion is likely to be further amplified as the
> Indian mainstream media hyperventilates and virtually runs amok with its

People are already finding links to Pakistan. _Offstumped_
[informs](http://offstumped.wordpress.com/2010/02/13/pune-blast-follows-
lashkar-threat/) that the Pune blast followed a Laskar-e-Taiba threat. A top
leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba named Pune as a target city at [a permitted
public rally](http://www.hindu.com/2010/02/06/stories/2010020660781500.htm) in
Pakistan. _The Acorn_ [says](http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2010/02/13/pune-
and-after/):

> Despite the Lashkar-e-Taiba threat, it is too early to definitively
> attribute the attack to the Pakistani military-jihadi complex. But it is
> clear that the Pakistani military-jihadi complex has [every
> reason](http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2010/02/05/talk-time/) to escalate
> tensions with India through the use of terrorism. Without the excuse of
> “tensions to the east”, Pakistan would have nothing left to explain to
> Washington its double-dealing on the taliban.

_Dilip D'Souza_ at _Death Ends Fun_ [reminds that India should also do
something about the homegrown
terror](http://dcubed.blogspot.com/2010/02/pune.html):

> Until we recognize homegrown terror for what it is — no less than anything
> from abroad — and until we stand against every kind of terror, we will never
> defeat terrorism.

The Twittersphere was abuzz with tweets and retweets spreading the news. Here

No doubt the blast in Pune will impact the recent goodwill talks between India
and Pakistan. But it seems that the terrorists are being given the upper hand
as emotions are running high everywhere.
