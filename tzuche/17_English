Following two high profile visits from New Delhi-Foreign Minister S.M Krishna
and Army Chief Deepak Kapoor, the India Nepal relation is being discussed with
renewed vigor in both Indian and Nepali blogs.

_Pragoti_ , a left leaning Indian blog, talks about “[the right scientific
vision for Indo-Nepal relations](http://pragoti.org/node/3775)”, asserting
that bilateral relations could improve if India strives for a progressive
foreign policy.

> “As long as the Nepali Maoists continue to rely on the Nepali people to
> democratically stake their claim to power and also to implement their stated

India's suspicions regarding the Maoist aside, another issue that has been
casting negative shadows over Indo-Nepal relations is the border issue.
Allegations have been leveled against India for encroaching Nepali land.
_[United we blog for democratic Nepal](http://blog.com.np/2010/01/25/on-nepal-
india-border-issue/)_ features an interview with Buddhi Narayan Shrestha, the
former Director General of Survey Department (Nepal) on the very issue, where
he presents some specifics regarding dispute:

> “The pillars, which were erected as per the Survey Map of British India,
> were not found in their location. For example, pillar no 708 at Kauwakhera
> of Lalboji VDC of Kailali district was found to be 30 metres inside Nepal.
> But both the local residents and the visiting CA committee concluded that
> this could have happened because of the change of course of the Mohana
> river. Secondly, we found some subsidiary (minor) pillars missing. For
> example, new pillars numbered 407/1, 2 and 3 between Bhajani and Lalbhoji
> VDC of Kailali district were not found. In other cases, the minor pillars
> have been broken. Similarly, the 182 maps show half-km no-man’s land on
> either side of the border. But no-man’s land was not found in places like
> the Pyaranala area of the Parasan VDC in Kanchanpur district. At some places
> the Indian side had encroached upon Nepali territories. In other places,
> Nepal had encroached upon the border. ….”

Mr. Shrestha says that in some cases Nepal has also encroached upon Indian
land, but so far that side of the dispute has not received much attention.
Maoists are leading the charge against India on the border issue, they are
also calling for renegotiation of 1950 Friendship Treaty between the two
countries.

Maoist leader Prachanda

In 2008, an interview with Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) was
published in _The Hindu_ , where the treaty was discussed. Bloggers at
_[Chennai-Based Chinese National Newspaper (CBCNN)
Blog](http://cbcnn.blogspot.com/2008/05/india-nepal-friendship-treaty-
of-1950.html)_ analyzed the interview and commented on Prachand'a assertions
that India has nothing to fear from growing Nepal-China friendship:

> “The idea that Chinese penetration of Nepal ought not to be of much concern
> because China does not need that country to create problems for India is
> laughable. Political and military strategists look at advantage, not bare
> necessity – China does not need Burma either but it has nevertheless
> established military bases in that country and is said to be actively
> monitoring Indian Naval activities from there. The U.S. sought transit
> facilities from Turkey to launch its invasion into Iraq again not because it
> was required – they achieved their objectives without it anyway – but
> because it would shorten the campaign and would have potentially made it
> easier. The same is equally true in case of Chinese interest in Nepal – it
> would be the height of folly for India to plan its own strategy based on
> whether China needs Nepali support to confront India.”

It is obvious that political turmoil in Nepal is affecting its relationship
with India. At present, various political parties are using disputes with
India to further their agenda; hopefully once the rough waters smooth, Indo-
Nepal relations will be guided by mutual interest and trust.
