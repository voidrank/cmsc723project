Sometimes people ask what India is – a country, an idea or a culture?
According to _Supriyo Chaudhuri_ “India is an experience. It is greater than
the country, more diverse than just the idea and more dynamic than what is
understood to be its culture;” as [described in his
blog](http://sundayposts.blogspot.com/2010/03/india-experience.html) _The
Sunday Posts_.
