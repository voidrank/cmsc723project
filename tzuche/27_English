Black Looks discusses [the fight against HIV/AIDS in
Africa](http://www.blacklooks.org/2007/12/dealing_with_hivaids_in_africa.html):
“But I was quickly disappointed by the article, even if it spoke some truths
that I would agree with. Shunning promiscuity is one of those. But the author
also says things like, “since the condom is about safe sex and safe sinning,”
it cannot be Jesus’ approach. Now, I don’t know if it would be Jesus’ approach
— my worry lies in the fact that the author thinks condoms are for sinning.”
