Here are just a few of the online networks and databases which have mobilized
in the last few days to help relatives abroad locate family and direct
urgently needed help to survivors, many of whom are still trapped beneath the
wreckage of their own homes.

The International Committe of the Red Cross has an [extensive online database
of the missing](http://www.familylinks.icrc.org/WFL_HTI.NSF/) where friends or
family.

Major news organizations like the [New York
Times](http://twitter.com/nytimes/haiti-earthquake) and
[CNN](http://www.ireport.com/ir-topic-stories.jspa?topicId=381628&hpt=T1) , as
well as [Google](http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/), have also set up databases
for the missing. A site called [Haiti Earthquake
Support](http://beextra.org/Haiti) Center is working on a tool which would
allow volunteers to help match faces in news photographs to faces of missing
persons.

The Facebook Group [EARTHQUAKE
HAITI](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&gid=252988675717) currently
has over 150,000 members and [more than 4,000
photographs](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=photos&gid=252988675717&so=0)
posted by family looking for loved ones.

[Ushahidi](http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/13/haiti-earthquake/),
used to great effect during the [Kenyan election
crisis](http://kenya.ushahidi.com/), is also [mapping crisis
information](http://haiti.ushahidi.com/), including missing persons reports,
information about collapsed buildings, and road conditions.

On Twitter, the tag
[#relativesinhaiti](http://twitter.com/#search?q=relativesinhaiti) is being
used by Haitians abroad who are still trying to locate missing relatives.
Meanwhile, [#rescuemehaiti](http://twitter.com/#search?q=rescuemehaiti) is
being used to direct search & rescue efforts to specific addresses around
Port-au-Prince where survivors are known to be still trapped under the rubble:
