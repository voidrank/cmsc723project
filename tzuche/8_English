There is a disturbing rise in child abuse cases in Pakistan. According to
[UNICEF Local Officer Shamshad
Qureshi](http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/unicef-to-launch-
several-projects-to-curb-child-abuse-in-pak_100320352.html) the reason is lack
of proper law enforcement, negligence of parents and lack of awareness among
the children and the society. He also said that the major factor for
pedophilia in Pakistan was the easy access of people to children due to the
negligence of parents.

_Faheem Haider_ at _Bangladesh Foreign Policy Blog_
[discusses](http://bangladesh.foreignpolicyblogs.com/2010/02/06/child-workers-
and-child-abuse-in-bangladesh/) about the abuse of children and child workers
in Pakistan and Bangladesh. He doesn’t mince as he shows us another very
common side of child abuse:

> “Unable to feed a growing family, desperate parents farm out their children
> to affluent homes to serve as servants, maids or nannies (child-keepers is
> the more proper sense in which these children are employed in those house-
> holds). These children then become, effectively, the wards of their
> employers and are often treated like personal property. The birth parents
> remain out of sight, perhaps hundreds of miles away, unaware that their
> babies are just so much flesh and burdened bone for the caprice and rubbed
> temper of their unbecomingly unkind lords.
>
> Justice has been put aside for these children. They are the flotsam of
> unsettled poverty and the repackaged gifts of unhinged circumstances.
> Opportunity does not avail them; outcomes remain unmarked and the
> appropriate ends to which they might be working are unknown to them. Justice
> is for these children an inattentive teacher.”

_Fatima Bhutto_ is not only a influential political heir but also a
humanitarian. In a blog post in _The Daily Beast_ she doesn’t leave much to be
said by [painting a grim picture of child
abuse](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-02-08/maid-murder-
rocks-pakistan/):

> “The brutal murder of a 12-year-old maid, believed to have been killed by
> her powerful employer, has stunned the country. But from the corrupt
> government to the honor killing of a wealthy woman, the country's rich
> always get away with it.
>
> Shazia Masih, a tiny 12-year-old who looked years younger than her age, was
> laid to rest last week after a Christian funeral at Lahore's Cathedral
> Church. She had been employed by the wealthy and influential former
> president of Lahore's Bar Association, and for a generous $8 a month she
> cleaned her employer's toilets, the cars that filled their suburban garage,
> and the filth that collected on the floors of their home.”

This [YouTube

shows that a teacher of a government school abused a student as punishment but
nobody did anything.

The term ‘child abuse’ covers a wide array of very diverse kinds of crimes
subjected towards the minors. It signifies physical as well as mental pain.
When an adult tries to use a child as a sex toy it is child abuse. When an
adult tries to appease his labour needs at a lower cost it is also child
abuse. When a child is exploited as a commodity and traded for monetary or non
monetary produce it is child abuse. When an adult forces the child to push
himself beyond his strength overlooking all health guidelines for children it
is child abuse.

Pakistan is a country that does little in protecting its young worlds from the
many horrors of child abuse that they are exposed to in and around the green
pastures.
