Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto (54) was
[assassinated](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=abaD6XPZ9jwU&refer=home)
in Rawalpindi earlier today at a political rally. Ironically according to
media reports Rawalpindi is one of the most secure cities in Pakistan and
teeming with security folks. In another irony according to a report on the BBC
Benazir was assassinated in almost the same place as Pakistan's first Prime
Minister.

Her
[assassination](http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-7181092,00.html
"Beanzir Bhutto") puts the future of Pakistan's political future in turmoil
and there are questions being raised if Pakistan will plunge into a civil war.

[Benazir](http://www.cfr.org/publication/14041/conversation_with_benazir_bhutto.html
"Benazir Bhutto's interview with The Foreign Relations Council") was the first
woman to be elected twice as Prime Minister of Pakistan.

What a tragic end for a leader, who was fighting for democracy in Pakistan.
Her return to Pakistan earlier this year started off on a wrong foot when an
attempt was made to bomb her cavalcade that was traveling from the airport to
her ancestral home. With this sudden death the political future of Pakistan is
once again on an uncertain footing. The question is whether elections will be
held next month.

A controversial leader, [Benazir's](http://www.wic.org/bio/bbhutto.htm
"benazir bhutto") political views were shaped by her father Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, a former Prime Minister of Pakistan. A seasoned orator and writer
[Benazir](http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/27/bhutto.obit/)
studied in UK and the USA before returning to Pakistan and joining her
father's political party Pakistan's People's Party (PPP) and was was the Prime
Minister of Pakistan. At _[Metroblogging
Lahore](http://lahore.metblogs.com/archives/2007/12/ther_bigger_tra.phtml)_ ,
a blogger states that despite not supporting Bhutto's politics, the sudden
death of the political leader is a tragic event.
