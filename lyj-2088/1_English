In a development spelling more gloom for an embattled ethnic minority and
highlighting the ever-deepening political crisis in the country, the co-
leaders of Turkey's opposition People's Democratic Party (HDP) most noted for
defending the rights of ethnic Kurds have been arrested, media reported.

HDP co-chairs Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag were reported by Turkish
news agencies, [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-
kurds-idUSKBN12Y2XA?il=0) and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-
europe-37868441) as being arrested October 3 along with at least nine other
party members in connection with an anti-terror investigation. Dermitas, who
like other opposition politicians did not endorse the bloody coup attempt that
took place in Turkey in July, has been relentlessly critical of president
Recep Tayiip Erdogan's policies towards Kurds, including in an interview
published the day of his arrest.

Even for the Turkish government controlled by the dominant Justice and
Development Party (AKP) the move carries some risks as Dermitas and Yuskedag
have earned reputations among left-leaning Turks, foreign governments and
international organisations as principled, combative politicians.

The arrests however will be popular with Turkish nationalists, who conflate
HDP with the pro-independence Kurdish militants with whom the government
recommenced hostilities last summer.

HDP stormed into the parliament for the first time in June 2015 in the first
of two general elections held in Turkey last year, on the back of considerable
support from both the Turkish community and young urban voters supportive of
the Gezi Park movement that was suppressed using heavy-handed policing two
years before.

When the vote was held again following a failure to form a coalition
government, HDP only sneaked past the 10% vote share threshold and into the
legislature following an AKP electoral campaign full of fear and intimidation
that helped them regain a parliamentary majority.

In May Turkey's parliament voted for legislation to strip lawmakers of
immunity from prosecution that critics said was intended specifically to
target HDP.

The party was excluded from a public and highly politicized show of national
unity organised by the government and including all the other parties from the
parliament shortly after the coup attempt took place.

Turkey's government blames the coup on secretive US-based cleric Fethullah
Gulen, figurehead of the global Hizmet social and religious movement.
