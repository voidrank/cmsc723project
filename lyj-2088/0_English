A 28-year-old activist named Kwon Pyong was reportedly detained in Jilin,
China after he shared plans to wear a t-shirt with messages expressing
sentiments against Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The t-shirt, seen above, combines the President's family name, Xi, with the
name Hitler.

He previously told a friend that he was planning to wear a t-shirt with anti-
Xi messages on the street on October 1, China’s National Day. Friends of Kwon
Pyong – who is ethnically Korean and previously studied abroad in the US – say
that they have been unable to reach him for a month.

A friend of Kwon's named Gu Yi, who is studying abroad in the US, said he
received a message from Kwon on September 30 that said “something [bad]
happened”. Gu has been unable to contact him since. An officer at the Yanji
police department confirmed to US-backed Radio Free Asia that Kwon is
currently in police custody. Officers at the same police department who
answered the phone were unable to confirm Kwon’s detention with Hong Kong Free
Press.

Gu said that Kwon was previously called in to talk with state security
officers after he sent postcards to detained human rights lawyers. Gu told
Radio Free Asia:

> But then he told me on Sept. 30 that he planned to walk around in that
> T-shirt. I told him not to do it, but he insisted […] We didn’t think he
> would run into trouble because he had worn that kind of t-shirt before.

Kwon actively tweeted about topics including China’s crackdown on lawyers, the
Tiananmen massacre, Tibet, Hong Kong independence, human rights, and other
sentiments opposing the Chinese government:

> I pretty much love to see that a independent HK will raise up in the future.

At the end of August, Kwon [posted a photo of himself with the
t-shirt](https://twitter.com/kwonpyong/status/770081265475325953) on Twitter,
saying that “Xitler” was inspired by a tweet from former Tiananmen Square
student leader and activist [Rose Tang](https://twitter.com/rosetangy). Below
the word “Xitler” are Chinese phrases saying “Xi Baozi” (steamed buns) and
“Big Spender” – both pejorative terms referring to the Chinese leader. The
background of the photo may have included enough details to reveal his
whereabouts in China.

Tang commented on his arrest:

> He’s one of a very small number of young Chinese who have been outspoken in
> criticising the Chinese government on Twitter using their real names.
> Beijing has been cracking down on Chinese Twitter users for a number of
> years but his case signals a new wave of crackdowns on young Twitter users
> in its attempts to diminish the rare and sparse sparks of a pro-democracy
> and human rights movement which has been stymied since Xi Jinping took
> office.

US-based group the Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars issued a
statement condemning his detention and calling for Kwon’s release.

Gu is helping to organise people around the world to wear t-shirts resembling
Kwon’s and protest outside Chinese consulates and embassies around the world.
