Top news these days among Hungarian and European netizens is the death of
[László Csizsik-
Csatáry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Csizsik-Csat%C3%A1ry),
one of the most wanted Nazi war criminals [ who died on Saturday, August 10
while awaiting trial in Hungary.](http://www.bosnewslife.com/29778-news-watch-
hungarys-top-nazi-war-crimes-suspect-dies-at-98)

The 98-year-old Hungarian native who topped the dwindling list of surviving
[Nazi war crime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_war_crimes) suspects died
in a hospital as his trial for allegedly sending nearly 16,000 Jews to death
camps neared. The announcement of Csatáry's death was made by officials on
Monday, August 12 in Budapest.

His lawyer stated that the Nazi war crime suspect died in the hospital over
the weekend after contracting pneumonia. His death came as a setback for
Holocaust survivors still seeking some justice.

A file that the [Simon Wiesenthal
Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center) had prepared on
Csatáry implicated him in the deportation of 300 people from
[Kassa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C5%A1ice) (Kosice) in 1941. In August
2012, the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office dropped these charges, saying Csatáry
was not in Kassa at the time and lacked the rank to organize the transports.
In January 2013, it was reported that Slovak police had found a witness to
corroborate other charges relating to deportations of 15,700 Jews from Kassa
from May 1944.

Hungarian authorities have said Csatáry was the chief of an internment camp
for Jews in 1944 in Kosice, a Slovak city then part of Hungary, beating
inmates with his bare hands and a dog whip. He had also been charged with
assisting in the deportation of thousands of Jews to
[Auschwitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp) and
other Nazi death camps. He denied the charges.

[Csatáry was sentenced to death in
absentia](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/laszlo-csatary-dead-
hungary-auschwitz) in Czechoslovakia in 1948 for similar war crimes. A
Budapest court in July suspended the case against Csatáry citing double
jeopardy, as the charges filed by Hungarian prosecutors were similar to those
in his 1948 conviction. Hungarian prosecutors appealed against the decision
and a ruling was pending.

Csatáry's case and his whereabouts were revealed in 2012 by the Simon
Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish organisation which hunts Nazis who have yet to be
brought to justice.

Most netizens from around the globe couldn't hide their disappointment
regarding his death.

A year ago Csatáry's unknown location was discovered by reporters for British
paper “The Sun”, who knocked on his door for statements. Csatáry's trial was
scheduled to begin next month.
