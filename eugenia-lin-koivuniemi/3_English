Afghanistan's provinces written in Pashto. Tajiks and other Dari-speaking
ethnic minorities fear that the language will dominate theirs as a result of
Pashtun political power. Wikipedia image.

Salahuddin Rabbani, Afghanistan's new minister of foreign affairs and son of
the country's murdered former president Burhanuddin Rabbani, is facing a
barrage of criticism for beginning his pre-approval speech to the Afghan
parliament in Pashto. The fiercest criticism is coming from Rabbani's Dari-
speaking ethnic kin, who feel betrayed that he chose to speak in a language
that is not his native tongue.

Pashto and Dari are the two official languages of Afghanistan according to the
constitution. While all but two of Afghanistan's rulers for the last two
centuries — Habibullah Kalakani and Burhanuddin Rabbani — were ethnic
Pashtuns, Dari, a local name for Farsi, is more widely used in written form
than Pashto. Dari is also the preferred language of several of the country's
non-Pashtun ethnic groups, including the large Tajik minority Rabbani hails
from.*

Shortly after the speech on January 27, Abdullatif Pedram, the leader of the
National Congress Party of Afghanistan and an ethnic Tajik, [wrote a widely
circulated Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/latif.pedramiii.7/posts/1550777275173904?pnref=story)
criticizing the new coalition government of Afghanistan and calling it
“illegal” and “anti-constitutional”. Salahuddin Rabbani had “betrayed [his]
native language and Farsi culture,” Pedram added.

the dual nationality of the new minister of foreign affairs, a factor that
held up his appointment:

> باید به زبان انگلیسی صحبت میکرد .تابعیت انگلیس داشت.

> He would be better off speaking English as he has British citizenship.

In actual fact Afghan media
[reported](http://elections.pajhwok.com/en/2015/01/26/cancellation-rabbani-s-
british-nationality-confirmed) that the country's lower house had approved the
cancellation of Rabbani's British citizenship on January 26, paving the way
for him to be approved as foreign minister January 27. Afghanistan's
parliament has still yet to agree over half of President Ashraf Ghani's
ministerial nominees, many of whom are also citizens of two countries. **

Both Ghani, who identifies as an ethnic Pashtun, and his erstwhile rivals for
the presidency, took steps to build ethnically diverse coalitions in the [run
up to the vote earlier this
year](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/10/11/afghan-netizens-debate-
presidential-candidates/). Ghani, for instance, included [Ahmad Zia
Massoud](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/world/asia/abdullah-abdullah-
afghanistan-presidential-election-coalition.html?_r=0), a Tajik and the
brother of the legendary Northern Alliance commander [Ahmad Shah
Massoud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Massoud) in his presidential
team. Many ethnic Tajiks criticised Ahmad Zia Massoud for siding with Ghani
rather than his presidential rival Abdullah Abdullah, a half-Pashtun-half-
Tajik who was one of the Ahmad Shah Massoud's closest friends before the
latter's assassination in 2001.

Rabbani, who was Afghanistan's Ambassador to Turkey in 2011, is foreign
educated and viewed as technocrat, despite having strong Tajik tribal
connections through his late father. By beginning his speech in Pashto, he may
have sought to smooth the ethnic and linguistic divides in the country.
Instead, he seems to have aggravated them further.
