The [Muisca language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibcha_language) is
officially extinct. The language, part of the Chibcha linguistic family, was
previously spoken by the Muisca people, who lived around Colombia's central
highlands including the area surrounding present-day Bogotá. Much of the
language's history is found in texts and documents from the 16th and 17th
centuries, rescued from archives where they sat dormant. The language's path
towards extinction was cemented by the ruling of [King Charles III of
Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain), who banned its use
as a way to further control the indigenous population. The law remained until
Colombia's 1991 Constitution was passed.

Even though the language is not actively used, it remains alive and well in
some of the daily words used by Colombians, which were borrowed from the
Muisca language. These words, usually used to describe local animals, plants,
and fruits, are called “[muisquismos](http://muysca.cubun.org/Muisquismos),”
and are often used in and around Bogotá by residents unaware of the words’
origins.

The historical importance of this extinct language piqued the interest of a
group of linguistics and anthropology students from various universities
around Colombia, which has been working to slowly bring the language back. By
taking advantage of digital tools, apps, and social media, the project called
“[Muysccubun](http://www.cubun.org)” has been working to document and share
the language on the Internet. Their activities include transcribing primary
source materials in Muisca and uploading to a
[wiki](http://muysca.cubun.org/Portada). They have created a Spanish-Muisca
online dictionary, also available as a [free Android
app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=diccionario.muisca.online&hl=es_419).

This material is also shared through the group's [Facebook
Page](https://www.facebook.com/muyskkubun), where they have been sharing the
Muisca word of the day linking to the documentation on the wiki. [For
example](https://www.facebook.com/muyskkubun/posts/794138010675374):

> Palabra del día:
>
> [iaia](http://muysca.cubun.org/iaia)
>
> Fon. Gonz. */iaia/  
>  Fon. Cons. */iaia/
>
> 1\. Red *de pesca.  
>  2\. Despeinado.

> Word of the day:
>
> [iaia](http://muysca.cubun.org/iaia)
>
> Fon. Gonz. */iaia/  
>  Fon. Cons. */iaia/
>
> 1\. Fishing net.  
>  2\. disheveled.

This experience using technology to engage with the Muisca language led to
similar initiatives led by the Muysccubun team, including the creation of an
online Sáliba language-Spanish dictionary, also available as an [Android app
](http://saliba.caroycuervo.com/P%C3%A1gina_principal)in conjunction with the
Caro and Cuervo Institute. They are also collaborating with Mozilla Colombia
to [promote the localization of the Firefox
browser](http://www.cubun.org/c5/index.php/firefox-lenguas-nativas-de-
colombia) into Colombian indigenous languages.

While there are some new initiatives to teach Muisca in some [rural
schools](http://guaiahycha2012.blogspot.com/2012/01/jizcamox-colombian-public-
school-where.html), as well as various classes in Bogotá, the project hopes
that their contribution to document and revitalize the Muisca language can
flourish with the help of their work in digital media.
