Reform is the buzzword in recent political debates in Bangladesh.

The state of emergency imposed in the country refrains people from active
politics. But talks are being held at the party levels to cleanse (from
corruption) and reform the politics in Bangladesh and establishing democracy
within the parties. Rumi of _In the Middle of Nowhere_
[claims](http://rumiahmed.wordpress.com/2007/07/03/can-the-empire-strike-or-
at-least-scratch-back/) it is happening apparently under the direction and
patronage of the people enforcing the state of emergency.

_An ordinary citizen_ [lauds](http://bdoza.wordpress.com/2007/07/05/no-
dialogue-before-reform/) the Election Commission's statement that “there will
be no dialogue (for preparations of the upcoming election) before reform of
the political parties”.

So what forms of reform people are talking about? Rumi has

at-least-scratch-back/):

> It mostly proposes removal of current leader by imposing a term limit,

_Angelmorn_ [criticizes](http://otherface.wordpress.com/2007/06/14/shall-we-
let-them-go/) the alleged minus two formula which deducts both the leaders of
AL & BNP, the two major rivals, who are blamed for the current situation.

The looming storm is the battle of the Two Ladies with their reformist
colleagues within their parties.

_Dhaka Shohor_ [slams](http://dhakashohor.blogspot.com/2007/07/suranjit-
sengupta-prefers-pepsi-over.html) a reform proposal by Suranjit Sen Gupta, a
senior leader of Awami League labeling it a Pepsi or Coke situation.

> He seems content to transfer us from a Prime Ministerial dictatorship into a

Suddenly every major parties are coming up with reform proposals for their
respective parties. _Angelmorn_
[wonders](http://otherface.wordpress.com/2007/07/06/in-house-politics-and-
reforms/):

_Rumi_ [says](http://rumiahmed.wordpress.com/2007/06/26/political-reform-or-

There are widespread speculations about what is to happen in near future in
the political arena. All are anxiously waiting for the overdue election which
is promised sometime in the mid of next year by the incumbent [Caretaker
Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government).
