June 24 is a special celebratory date throughout Latin America, as [Juan
Arellano wrote about the festivities in
Peru](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/06/24/peru-celebrating-
june-24-san-juan-and-inti-raymi/). In Bolivia, the date is celebrated on the
eve of San Juan, which is said to be the coldest night of the year. Families
and friends gather around a bonfire in an attempt to remain warm, while
enjoying food (especially hot dogs) and drink. However, the collective smoke
from the numerous bonfires leaves the skyline especially contaminated the next
day, which draws the ire of residents that wake up the next day coughing and
with red eyes.

The _Democracy Center blog_ [writes about efforts in the cities to encourage
responsible partying](http://www.democracyctr.org/blog/2007/06/when-smoke-
gets-in-your-eyes.html), “Public service announcements in La Paz featured rap
singers beckoning people, “don’t burn, don’t burn.” Here in Cochabamba a small
group of people dressed up as fires and walked around aiming to spread the
“don’t burn” message.”

Hugo Miranda of _Angel Caido [ES]_ [writes that he has always remembered
lighting a bonfire with his family, and acknowledges that it contributes to
the smoggy air](http://angelcaido666x.blogspot.com/2007/06/san-juan-y-yo-
quemeoruro-amanecio-asi.html). Environmentalists and governmental officials
always urge citizens to refrain from these fires around this holiday. However,
Miranda thinks that this should extend to the entire year.

What can I add? Some condemn these feasts that are harmful to the environment.
However, the contamination is not a one-day problem; it is a problem year-
round. Hearing the environmentalists, I remember the saying that many
Catholics think that going to church on Sundays or celebrate a Virgin or
Christ's feast thinks that salvation is already guaranteed.

Food is a big part of the festivities and Vania Balderrama of Capsula de
Tiempo [ES] recalls how “hot dogs,” on of the traditional foods on this date,
are not a common part of everyday vocabulary in Bolivia.

I bought sausages, but I forgot to buy bread, so we sent Amalia (our household
worker) to buy hot dog buns. Nothing. The poor thing went to all of the nearby
stores, all the way to the small plaza, and almost arrived to the first ring
and found nothing. She came back to say that there was no hot dog buns
anywhere. I was angry because the sausages were now cold. I went to the little
store close to my house and ask where in the heck I could find hot dog buns.
Mrs. Tere said that she had no idea and meanwhile I was talking with her,
another lady arrived and said “give me panchitos buns’ and Mrs. Tere gave her
hot dog buns!!!!

Finally, bloggers in La Paz found a way to celebrate San Juan in their own
way, [with a blogger meet-up](http://urbandina.blogspot.com/2007/06/san-juan-
bloguero-urbandino-6-encuentro.html). Organizer _Cronicas Urbandinas [ES]_
wrote about the invitation on his blog.
