I've translated [a post by
_cyxymu_](http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/217606.html), apropos of [Russia
easing some of the visa restrictions on
Georgians](http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/1367_may_30_2007/n_1367_2.htm)
(possibly related to [Georgia's role in Russia's WTO
accession](http://en.rian.ru/world/20070530/66347710.html)). Having a visa
regime is an unusual situation between Russia and a former Soviet republic
that's a CIS member; however, it's been the situation – with [occasional
talk](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-74294957.html) of easing the requirement
– for Georgians and Russians since around 2000, and has been [an element of
Russia's support for the secessionist areas of
Georgia](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2003/12/10/017.html) as well as
– more recently – a representation of [increased tensions between the two
countries](http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2006/10/1-RUS/rus-041006.asp?po=y).
Now it looks like Russia will apparently allow certain categories of Georgians
to receive visas:

> Only a naive person could believe that the Russian authorities decided to
> loosen the visa blockade of Georgia just out of kindness. No, with this
> action they wanted to sweeten the arrival of the delegation from Russia to
> negotiate Russia's WTO accession. The blockade is the stick, and the
> issuance of visas to certain groups of Georgian citizens is a small carrot.
>
> However, Georgia, I think, will continue to insist on the legalization of
> all border checkpoints on the Russo-Georgian border. Recently Russia has
> illegally opened checkpoints on the [River] Psou and at the Roksk tunnel,
> which Georgia has declared closed some time ago. And Georgia demands that
> Georgian customs officers occupy these checkpoints.
>
> One other disagreement is the Russian ban on the import of Georgian
> _Borzhomi_ [mineral water] and Georgian wines, based on trumped-up reasons.
> How can Georgia agree to Russia's WTO accession without the resolution of
> these problems? I don't think Georgia will agree.
>
> I of course do not intend to suggest that WTO membership is so necessary to
> the Russian people, but it is necessary for the oligarchs, and therefore for
> Putin, and he pressures Georgia to admit Russia to the WTO because his
> oligarchs are losing nearly a billion dollars a year.

[_Cyxymu_](http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/) is the most widely read and
commented on blog about Abkhazia that I've seen. It's written, I believe, by a
refugee (or, rather, [internally displaced
person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person)) from the
conflict. The blog's full title is “Memories of Sukhumi, the war, and pain,”
which gives you some idea of its focus, although recently the author has
written [a bit about the conflict in South
Ossetia](http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/219203.html) as well. It often has
photos of Sukhumi and other places in Abkhazia, along with reminiscences from
the blog's author or others in the comments section, and it has a consistent
community of readers/commenters who guarantee a lively dialogue and often add
their own very interesting information about goings-on in Abkhazia.
