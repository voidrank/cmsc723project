In these times of globalisation and world trade, the challenge of how to
protect the environment while ensuring increased economic growth appears to be
a problem facing many countries. In this article we offer glimpses of this,
first in Ghana through the post [‘Sweet ‘n
Sour’](http://www.carbonsmart.com/carboncopy/2007/09/sweet-n-sour.html), and
in China in the post [‘What China can learn from France’.

_Rory Williams_ of the blog _[Carbon
Copy](http://www.carbonsmart.com/carboncopy/2007/09/sweet-n-sour.html)_ points
to one of the negative effects of the deal struck between China and Ghana
where China is set to build a 400MW hydroelectric dam and Ghana is to supply
China with cocoa – massive deforestation. Rory also includes some poignant
facts about the ‘sour’ end of the deal.

> …originally forests covered 36 percent of Ghana's territory but by 2000 this
> had shrunk to just 10 percent. Forest clearing in Ghana is also a result of
> urban sprawl, export of timber, and use of wood for domestic fuel. Despite
> planting 10,000 hectares of managed forest a year, logging is taking place
> at an estimated 5 times the level it should be for sustainability.

The concept of [Green
GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Gross_Domestic_Product), an index of
economic growth with the environmental consequences of that growth factored
in, is mentioned in the post [‘What China can learn from
France’](http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/1295) by
Jianqiang Liu of the blog _China Dialogue_. (For some background on the idea
of Green GDP and the need for its adoption in China, read [ this
post](http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/1219-After-green-
GDP-what-next-) by _China Dialogue_ ‘s Ma Jun) Jianqiang Liu makes a
compelling case for the need for China to draw lessons from France's laws
regarding environmental protection, which offer a precedent for dealing with
myriad environmental problems.

> The significance of the charter is that no other law may contradict it. By
> contrast, China’s environmental laws are numerous and of little use. There
> are no consequences for companies or local governments that ignore them,
> which they continue to do. Enshrining the principles of environmental
> protection and sustainable development in the Chinese constitution would
> give them unprecedented legal status as well as symbolic power.

Last but not least, also from _China Dialogue_ is a post on India's third
liberation – An economy that benefits the poor and protects the environment.
The manner in which this can be achieved is [outlined by _John
Elkington._](http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/1296) In
addition he wonders whether India can join China in a new ‘axis of
sustainability’.
