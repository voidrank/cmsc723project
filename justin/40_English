The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted to [impose sanctions
against Iran](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6205295.stm) over
its failure to halt its uranium enrichment programme on December 23, 2006.

Despite the gravity of the situation, Iranian President [Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad) described the
UN’s decision as unimportant and vowed to continue uranium enrichment.

As a result, tension between the US and Iran is growing and many people are
worried about another war in the Middle East. Iranian bloggers have discussed
this issue and share their growing concern over the future of their country.  
In _Forever Under Construction_ ,we learn aboout an anti-war campaign: [Enough
fear](http://www.enoughfear.org).This campaign begins with individuals willing
to stand up and say no. This website will collect and display photos of people
from the US, Iran and other countries holding up a hand in the universal
symbol for “stop!”

In his blog, [Robo wrote](http://homeyra.wordpress.com/2007/01/19/no-
war/):“I’m worried these days. You are too. These days we’re all too worried
and distracted to focus on our daily affairs.  
I’m only a simple florist without the means to weather the hardships of war. I
haven’t forgotten my childhood spent in ‘potato years’ – my word for the 80’s.
I can’t bear the loss of my friends and countrymen. I am against the war. I
don’t want a heavy conscious when I die.”

_[Pouya](http://www.pouyashome.com/weblog/archives/000658.html)_ [Fa] says US
Foreign Secretary [Condoleeza
Rice's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice) trip to Middle East was
successful enough to unite small and large Arab countries against Iran. The
blogger says when the US was in Middle East, Iranian President took a useless
trip to Latin America. The blogger adds Iranian people are confused about the
current situation.

According to _Pouya_

_[Haji Washington](http://hajiwashington.com/blog/1385/10/29/the-game-
starts/)_ [Fa] says Iran should not be afraid of the US as Arab countries in
the Persian Gulf are the bigger threat.The blogger adds there is an
international coalition against Iran and western banks are pressing sanctions
while Japan is reducing its economic activities.

_[Ali Mazroi](http://mazrooei.ir/2007/01/17/post_127/)_ [Fa], a reformist
politician, talks about Iran's miscalculation in handling its nuclear crisis.
He says the US was not in a rush to send the Iranian nuclear case to the
Security Council. According to the blogger, the US convinced all countries
that the only solution for the Iranian nuclear crisis was the Security
Council.

_Ali Mazroi_ says,as a citizen:

> country and Islamic Republic into an endless hole.

_[View from Iran](http://viewfromiran.blogspot.com/2007/01/so-do-you-think-
there-will-be-war.html) _ writes with sarcasm about a conversation between
friends about the coming war: “I sure hope Iran doesn’t use any Shahab
missiles. If they do, it will be the start of WW 3, a friend says. Why do you
think that? They’ll hit everything but their intended target. A missile aimed
at Israel will hit Saudi Arabia or Russia or some other country. Everyone
laughs. Everyone goes about their daily business: hoarding saffron and tuna
fish.”

_[Mohammad Ali Abtahi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ali_Abtahi)_ , a
reformist politician and blogger, says former presidents [Khatami
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Khatami)and
[Rafsanjani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Hashemi_Rafsanjani) as well as
[Karoubi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Karrubi), the former Iranian
Parliament Speaker, have organised several meetings with former heads of
states and foreign affairs officials to discuss these very dangerous
circumstances.

[_Abthai_](http://www.webneveshteha.com/weblog/?id=2146308495) reports that
according to Mr Sadr, a former vice foreign affairs minister, Iran cannot
count on Syria because when they feel they are in danger they will make a deal
with US. He adds that it is the first time there are international sanctions
imposed against Iran.
