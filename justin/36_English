In August 2006, [Mean Lux](http://cam-blog.blogspot.com/), the blogger
advocate who introduced the term Clog and Clogger for Cambodia blog and
Cambodia blogger, launched a workshop named [Personal Information
Technology](http://pitw.wordpress.com/) to provide training that include
several sessions such as: how to use email, browse the Web, and more
importantly how to create and maintain blog. Up till now, more than 2000
university students participated in the organized workshops.

In the largest and most vibrant Cambodian city, Phnom Penh a large percent of
people speak English and have access to computer and the Net at Internet café.
The workshop organizers and their sponsor are optimistic that they can play an
active role in conducting the workshops for participants from as many higher
education institutions as possible. The blogging workshop has been made
possible with technical assistance from one of the Internet Service Providers,
[CityLink](http://www.citylink.com.kh/). Besides providing the cost of
producing training materials, the ISP also make the Internet connection
available at every practice session.

Mean Lux, his four other blogger evangelists
([Kalyan](http://kalyankeo.blogspot.com/), [Virak](http://www.khmerak.com/),
[Chantra](http://trajoke.blogsome.com/) and [younger
Kalyan](http://deedeedoll.blogspot.com/)) are able to run the workshop with
the recognition and appreciation of university lecturers who reserve
conference hall for over one hundred attendees as well as some computer
desktops that connect to the CityLink’s internet link. At [Build Bright
University](http://www.bbu.edu.kh/) in Siem Reap, about [200 student
attendees](http://deedeedoll.blogspot.com/2006/12/pit-workshop-held-at-siem-
reap.html) took the course.  
  
Clogger, a term coined in 2004 that derives from “Cambodia blogger,” is now
widely known to 2370 university students in Cambodia. Months before blog
became popular in the country that year, an early Cambodian blogger began a
series of training in some provinces, offering IT enthusiasts an introduction
to use personal publishing tool to post opinions and ideas.

Presenter [Kalyan](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/01/02/meet-the-new-
urban-cambodian-woman-and-blogger-keo-kalyan/) gave her personal impression
after a workshop in Cambodia's largest university that attracted 400 student:

> Yesterday our workshop on Personal Information Technology was held at PUC,
> and beyond our expectation there were about more than 400 participants
> including the Deans and the lecturers. I was very nervous…

Automated publishing services like Blogger and WordPress are free for users
from a commercial point of view. Personal presence on the Web is no longer for
elites, academics and geeks. New voices of these Internet story tellers,
thoughts and opinions are common and has become central point for
conversations spurred by opinionated readers that begins dialogs. The
interaction may not be real- time, but still, the two-way communication is
another effective way of critical idea exchanges on a particular issue. With
all these, suddenly, there are many more voices reporting information. While
this explosion is bound to cause some confusion, it also means many more
ideas, viewpoints, and opinions are available to the public. The result can
only be a better-informed world, one where no centralized entity can control
what others can learn.

Clog refers to a heavy shoe traditionally made of wood when talking about
attire. This term also means something that works against somebody as an
obstacle or hindrance. Metaphorically, what Camobdia blog aka Clog is about is
hardly understood.

When the Internet arrived in Cambodia in 1996-97, several years after China
and about two decades after the Internet was invented, a few Cambodians,
working alongside the expatriates from international aid agencies, for the
first time, experienced electronic mail, then a new revolutionary way of
communication. And about a decade later it is heartening to see more
Cambodians embrace these new high-tech services, one of which is blogging.
