Several Afghan bloggers have discussed Iranian government’s decision to expel
Afghan refugees to Afghanistan. Some of these refugees have lived in Iran for
years. Marine Gustavson, from Parsa NGO shows in our photo.You can see [more

Afghanistan's government called the consequences of sending back thousands of
people to tje country disastrous. Afghan Foreign Minister Rangeen Spanta[ has
asked Iran to cease the expulsions since they are exacerbating instability in
Afghanistan](http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373379).

**Afghan refugees in trouble**

_Habib Peyman_[criticised](http://www.habibpaiman.blogsky.com/)[Fa][ Ali
Khamenei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei),Leader of Islamic
Republic of Iran.The blogger says he remembers that Iran's leader criticised
American behaviour regarding prisoners in[
Guantanamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detainment_camp).Then
the blogger considers the Iranian government's decision to expell Afghan
refugees worse than American actions at Gutanamo. He says some Afghans were
picked up while they wanted to buy bread and were sent back to country.

_Dialogue 3_[says](http://dialog3.blogfa.com/post-192.aspx)[Fa] the main
reason for Iranian decision is that Afghan government has not permitted
Iranian universities and companies to be active in Afghanistan.The blogger
adds Iran wanted to sign a security agreement with Iran but Afghan government
refused that. _Dialogue 3_ thinks Afghan government took this decision under
influence of Americans.

**No Amnesty for war lords**

_Afghan Lord_[ is against amnesty for war
lords](http://www.afghanlord.org/2007/05/afghan-warlord-should-punished.html).
He says

> if the US and International community want to bring peace and prosperity in
> Afghanistan they should implement a cleared strategy against gangs of
> warlords and drug traffickers. The warlords should be taken to the war
> criminal court in The Hague and punished.  
>  In order to bring peace and normality to Afghanistan, the criminals should
> be sent to court.If the US and its alliance want to have support, they
> should sympathize with Afghanistan’s victims of war. If the Mujahideen (holy
> warriors) will not be punished, this country won’t gain peace and
> prosperity.

**The Orphanage**

In [_Parsa Kabul_](http://parsakabul.blogspot.com/) blog we [read
](http://parsakabul.blogspot.com/2007/04/letter-to-deputy-minister.html)about
a letter to the Deputy Minister about an orphanage:

> we submit the following reports documenting the conditions at the orphanage
> in an effort to initiate an investigation of the conditions of the
> orphanages in Afghanistan and the management systems in place. We do this
> not to create problems but to assist in the clarification of the problems so
> that you and your staff can take effective action. We do not consider this a
> poor reflection on this ministry. All countries struggle to care for their
> most vulnerable people appropriately. These conditions are understandable in
> the current struggle to develop Afghanistan. What is not tolerable is to
> know about these conditions and to not investigate and address the issues so
> that the children under your care have the quality of life they are entitled
> to. We have confidence that you and this network will do so expeditiously.
