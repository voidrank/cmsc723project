Extreme car customizing, dangerous drift racing and incomprehensively
dangerous stunts on the highways straight from Saudi Arabia.

Mona from Rebellious Arab Girl in [_Only in Saudi
Arabia_](http://www.rebelliousarabgirl.net/2008/09/02/only-in-saudi-arabia/)
posts [this terrifying stunt](http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=PJupNDIKkEk) she
found on YouTube of a group of Saudis skating on their sandals besides their
moving car:

On the dangerous stunt area, [Saudi2k6Boy brings us
](http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3lcwsMMPU)Saudi teens drifting their cars on
closed roads as well as highways with other drivers.

[Captive107](http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=oZtVzVbhxv4) shows us a Saudi man
climbing out of a window, walking on the hood of the car, opening it and then
climbing all the way to the trunk, all this with the car in motion.

Finally, a [customized car, Saudi
style](http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zRKLM9XQg), where the front doors slide
up, the back doors open to the back, the trunk opens on the side and one of
the doors swivels on its axis.
