The Bangladeshi blogosphere heated up reacting to the drama of the process of
exiling the two powerful lady politicians of Bangladesh.

[Sheikh Hasina Wazed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina) and [Begum
Khaleda Zia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia) crowned the center
stage in Bangladesh politics in the past few decades. They spearhead two
different ideologies in Bangladesh, which instead of providing the nation a
headway, divided the nation. The rivalry between the major two parties
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Awami League (AL) have made the
politics more confrontational and put the nation in chaos in recent times.
This has resulted in declaring a state of Emergency on January 11th this year
and the emergence of a military backed caretaker Government. The Government
has taken control of the situation by putting many corrupted politicians
behind the bar and suspending all political activities.

Now it seems they want to settle the score with the tradition of dynasty
politics in Bangladesh by sending Hasina and Khaleda in exile.

_The 3rd world_ view has
[details](http://rezwanul.blogspot.com/search/label/Sheikh%20Hasina) how
Sheikh Hasina is being barred from entering Bangladesh. Rumi has details on
the [deportation attempts](http://rumiahmed.wordpress.com/2007/04/22/khaleda-
zia-deportation-drama-continues/) of Khaleda Zia.

_The Bangladesh poet of Impropriety_ has [the
latest](http://tpoi.blogspot.com/2007/04/bangladesh-political-situation-
update.html) on the political situation of Bangladesh. _Voice of Bangladeshi
Bloggers_ [summarizes](http://deshivoice.blogspot.com/2007/04/political-
crisis.html) a few international press reactions.

However _Addafication_ sees this as [an
option](http://addafication.com/2007/04/22/exiled-ii/) to bring an end to
legacy of politics these two leaders were thriving:

Rehan of _Drishtipat Blog_ is
[apprehensive](http://www.drishtipat.org/blog/2007/04/19/political-vacuum/)
about the political vacuum that will create after the exile of these two
leaders.

However there is also widespread support for this government so far and not
all supports are without apprehensions. _Ahsan_
[thinks](http://ahsansrant.blogspot.com/2007/04/bangladesh-at-crossroads-
cautious.html) Bangladesh is now at a cross road:

> The caretaker government, who was given the responsibility to conduct a fair
> election, seems to be taking steps that no one was willing to take in the
> past. Can the current caretaker government create an atmosphere where not
> only the old corrupt leaders are forever removed from the political scene;
> but also new leaders emerge to guide the nation?

_Deshi Blog_ thinks that
[inexperience](http://www.littlebangladesh.com/deshiblog/inexperience-in-
politics-would-harm-the-caretaker-govt/) in politics would harm the Caretaker
Govt.

Sending both Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina to exile would certainly create
more chaos in Bangladesh. How can democracy be established by taking away the
fundamental rights of political leaders? The way the exile drama is being
handled hints abuse of the power, rather than judiciousness.
