Part of the discussion about Climate change in Africa has been covered by [The
Economist](http://economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7933596&story_id=9141893),
[NPR ](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9657621)and other
publications. On this inaugural post of environment news we read and hear from
two voices, one on the continent of Africa through the blog
[‘Kenvironews’](http://kenvironews.wordpress.com/), and the voice of Dr. Pius
Kamau, a physician in Denver. Through these voices we are transported to Sub-
Saharan Africa, specifically Kenya, where climate change is shown to have an
effect on farming and health.  
  
[The Kenya Environmental and Politics blog looks at the
debate](http://kenvironews.wordpress.com/2007/08/15/kenya-climate-change-and-
malaria/) centering around the connection between an increase in temperatures
in the once cooler climes of Nairobi, and a resurgence of malaria.

> The third assessment report, published in 2001, by the Intergovernmental
> Panel on Climate Change, paid special attention to highland malaria. The
> report states that due to the life-cycle of the mosquito and its role as
> host of the malaria parasite, “at low temperatures, a small increase in
> temperature can greatly increase the risk of malaria transmission” and
> “future climate change may increase transmission in some highland regions,
> such as in East Africa”.
>
> The resurgence of ‘highland malaria’ in several African countries has become
> controversial issues in debates about health and climate change.
>
> However, the IPCC report continues, “there are insufficient historical data
> on malaria distribution and activity to determine the role of warming, if
> any, in the recent resurgence of malaria in the highlands of Kenya, Uganda,
> Tanzania, and Ethiopia”.

The opinions of Doctors from the Kibera slum (pictured below) in Nairobi are
included, giving an invaluable, culturally contextual ‘on the ground’
perspective on the debate.

> Whatever the causes, and the scientific wrangles, medical staff working in
> Kibera are having to tackle malaria. “Malaria is the leading disease we
> face,” says George Gecheo, clinical officer in Kibera’s Ushirika clinic.
> Nurse Dorah Nyanja, who works in Senye Medical Clinic in the slum’s Soweto
> Market, adds: “I am treating more people per day for malaria than any other
> condition.”

The post concludes with a mention of the ways the Ministry of Health is
dealing with malaria prevention and treatment.

On NPR's [Morning
Edition](http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3&agg=0&prgDate=08-13-2007&view=storyview)
radio show, Dr. Pius Kamau, a diaspora Kenyan based in Denver talks about the
effects of climate change on his family's small coffee farm in Kenya. You can
listen to audio of the commentary [‘When the Drought Came, a Kenyan Farm
Died’](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12732559). Dr.
Kamau's commentary draws a full circle connection from the habits of modern
life in the developed world — piping hot Starbucks coffee, fuel-guzzling SUV's
— and the effect of these habits on global climate change to the deterioration
of his family's farm in Kenya. It is a gripping commentary that examines the
question of the Diaspora's choices in the developed world, their resulting
carbon emissions and what this means to their home countries. He points out
that it is also imperative for the Diaspora to take steps in conservation and
reduction of their carbon footprints.
