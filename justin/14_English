This week the two main topics the Sudanese blogged about are on the late
politician and former vice president Dr. John Garang and Sudan's acceptance of
the Darfur UN resolution.

_Sudanese Returnee_ was one of those who blogged in honor of [Dr. John
Garang:](http://sudanreturnee.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/remembering-a-sudanese-
hero-dr-john-garang/)

> The late Dr. John Garang is probably the greatest Sudanese politician in
> history. A Christian and a southern Sudanese from the Dinka tribe, Garang
> had a different view of what the problems of Sudan really was, and a clear
> vision/solution to these problems.

_Black Kush_ honored Dr. John Garang in another [post of his own
too:](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/07/hero-remembered.html)

> Two years ago, the former freedom fighter and Vice President of the Sudan
> Dr. John Garang de Mabior died in a helicopter crash in the junlges of South
> Sudan. In his [honour,](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article23057)
> the Sudanese lit candles, laid wreaths and pledged support of the CPA.
> However, the expectations of the peace is slowly turning into desparation.

_Black Kush_ also blogged about [Sudan's recent
acceptance](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/08/sudans-diplomatic-
coup.html) of the Darfur UN resolution:

> Sudan has won a huge [diplomatic
> coup](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article23093) with its acceptance
> of the new hybrid force for Darfur. UNAMID (United Nations African Union
> Mission in Darfur) will be a force that follows Sudanese demands: African
> structure, no chapter seven, no force disarmaments, no threat of sanctions.
> As the FM said, Resolution 1769 was made with their full consultation.

_Kizzie_ wrote an excellent post about [Sudanese inferiority
complex.](http://wholeheartedly-sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/07/dark-skin-and-
afros-our-worst-nightmare.html):

> We constantly bring ourselves down. We dislike ourselves. We are always
> trying to be something we are not. We view ourselves as inferior and others
> as superior. We need to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery!
>
> The dream of the average Sudanese girl is to marry well and have a lighter
> skin. Lighter skin is viewed as beautiful (Sudan is not the only one in this
> case!).

She also wrote [a post about the poor Arab coverage of
Darfur](http://wholeheartedly-sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/08/why-such-poor-
arab-journalism-when-it_04.html). In it she mentions Nabil Kassem, an Arab who
made a documentary on Darfur called [Jihad on Horseback](http://www.darfur-
awareness.org/2007/07/20/jihad-on-horseback/).

_The Sudanese Thinker_ , applied a simple [SWOT analysis on
Sudan](http://www.sudanesethinker.com/2007/07/31/applying-a-simple-swot-
analysis-to-sudan/).

_Konyokonyo_ , a Southern Sudanese doctor in South Sudan wrote about the
problem of [alcoholism there:](http://konyokonyo.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/cut-
the-booze-fellas/)

> Just a few days back my next door neighbour was found dead in his house.
> Friends say he had been drinking all the hight before. And the diagnosis:
> “ketuk”! Last week another guy was brought into my clinic, very sick, with
> signs of liver failure. He had a very long history of drinking.
>
> There are many stories in Juba in the past, with very similar endings, like
> people being found dead under trees. Now the phenomenon has gone up several
> scales for the worse. Many people are talking about the epidemic of drinking
> in Juba, but nobody cares to do anything about it. The unfortunate thing is
> that people continue to drink during working hours, in the offices.

And last but not least, _Amjad_ , a Sudanese in Oman is at it again with
[another movie review:](http://amjad248.blogspot.com/2007/08/movie-review-
simpsons-movie.html)

> So yesterday evening I finally got the chance to watch The Simpsons Movie
> with a bunch of friends.
>
> …All in all, the movie was very good, but if you didn't watch it yet, I
> recommend waiting for the DVD release. It is worth watching, but not worth
> being watched in the movies.
