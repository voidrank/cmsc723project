An interesting discussion on whether one should homeschool their children or
send them to a school appeared on some blogs from the Philippines.

_A Passerby's Trail_ [writes](http://blog.marientech.com/homeschooling.html)

And how it would help the kids, Tito continues

_Noypetes_ , [commenting on Tito's
post](http://titorolly.blogspot.com/2007/03/education-in-
future.html#c6497424768292015223) feels that home schooling might make class
re-unions a thing of the past and the students may not develop social skills
if they don't go to school and mix with other students.  

> Home schooling is fine. My Concern with home schooling is the lack of social
> interaction among peers which is very important in honing a childs
> independence to coexist in a society. I think some of the patterns in
> teaching fundamentals should be retained. I agree that the convenience of
> the IT or world wide web serves it's purpose well but in so many ways looses
> the intimate setting of learning with other kids and the full personal
> presence of a teacher

_A Passerby's Trail,_ having experience in handling large classes _,_ had
anticipated this “social skills” aspect, she

Tito has a [wish for future
