This week, many Myanmar Bloggers are celebrating and sending their wishes for
Burmese Opposition Leader, _Daw_ Aung San Suu Kyi's 62nd Birthday on the 19th
June 2007.

For years, the country's famous pro-democracy leader and Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi has to celebrate her birthday under house arrest; every year
people wishes for her release but till now all the wishes are in vain. It is
agonizing to see years after years of her resistant and suffering for the
faith of the country. Her persistent is deeply admired and the respect for her
grows in the hearts of many Myanmar youth.
