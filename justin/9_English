The face of Egypt has changed greatly after the revolution that brought
independence from foreign occupiers. From the Egypt created by [Gamal Abdel
Nasser](http://www.answers.com/Nasser) to the Egypt to be inherited by [Gamal
Mubarak](http://www.answers.com/Gamal%20Mubarak), the Egyptian Blogosphere is
recalling their personal experiences, objections, predictions and experiences
with blogger imprisonment.

When Nasser became president, shortly after the Egyptian revolution, life
changed for many Egyptians and a massive exodus to all corners of the globe
followed for those affected, as [recounted by _Maryanne Stroud Gabbani_

Since those days the role of government has not changed much, Egyptian laws
regarding women certainly haven't with few exceptions as documented by

The most recent years in the presidency of [Hosni
Mubarak](http://www.answers.com/Hosni%20Mubarak#top) have been some of the
most domestically controversial since the Egyptian Revolution, thanks mostly
to the clash of Government and opposition voices on Egyptian Blogs. The
largest casualty of war in this clash is Egyptian Blogger [Kareem
Amer](http://www.freekareem.org/about/) who was sentenced to four years in
jail for comments written on his blog.
[FreeKareem.org](http://www.freekareem.org/) tells of school children raising
money and [protesting on Kareem's

Many fear for the future of Egypt and what will change, possibly for the
worse. As John F. Kennedy once said, “Change is the law of life and those who
look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.” So what
changes does the future hold for Egypt? _Zeinobia_ gives us [her
prediction](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2007/08/autumn-wind-of-
change-in-egypt.html)…

The opposition by Egyptian bloggers against the government is progressive and
will only grow as we move closer to an imminent transition, whether that be to
Gamal Mubarak or a government controlled by the [Muslim
Brotherhood.](http://www.answers.com/Muslim%20Brotherhood) In any event the
Egyptian Blogosphere only promises to get more interesting, so check in with
me for next weeks round up and see what they're saying.
