Ask any photographer – Morocco is undoubtedly one of the world's most
photogenic locations. Australian [_Moroccan
Meanderings_](http://moroccanmeanderings.blogspot.com/2007/06/morocco-
snapshots.html) is one blogger who chose to substitute photos for words this
week, telling us:

> Since I have had some positive responses about the photographs on this blog,
> I thought I would include a few others that give a snapshot of Morocco.

The photo above is of the [Dades Gorge](http://www.answers.com/Dades%20Gorge),
in the southeast of the country. But not only the gorges are gorgeous! Blogger
[_Wakha_](http://wakha.blogspot.com/2006/08/fishermans-life.html) shares a
spectacular photograph from Essaouira along with a fitting quote:

The Moroccan sky is a common object of photographers, as already shown. [_The
Morocco Report_](http://www.moroccosavvy.com/taamarbuuta/2007/06/09/this-is-
where-i-live/) shows us another facet of Morocco's clear skies, this time
farther north in the city of Meknes.

But it isn't only the Moroccan sky that tantalizes – certain objets d'art can
do the same, particularly rugs, which Morocco is known for. Maryam of [_My
Marrakesh  
_](http://moroccanmaryam.typepad.com/my_marrakesh/2007/06/marrakesh_and_c.html)
shows us some of Morocco's multicolored treasures:

The last photo this week takes us to the [Fes Festival of World Sacred
Music](http://www.fesfestival.com), which is about to wrap up. Blogger [_Long
Way Home  
_](http://scarlettscion.blogspot.com/2007/06/week-in-pictures.html) shared a
smattering of photos from the festival, which turned out to be a truly
multicultural event this year. My favorite is of a group performing Gregorian
chants:
