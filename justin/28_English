The buzz surrounding Tallinn's [Bronze
Soldier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn) is gradually
subsiding, but it is still too early to speak of peace: Estonia's police are
preparing for possible unrest on May 9, pro-Kremlin youth groups are still
marching in Moscow, and politicians as well as bloggers continue arguing about
the situation.

While [the previous Global Voices
translation](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/04/27/estonia-a-russian-
rebellion) dealt with the violent events of April 26, below is [a completely
amicable entry](http://orang-m.livejournal.com/359128.html), written on May 3
by Tallinn-based LJ user _orang-m_ (RUS):

> On food
>
> I've been shooting at the Best Estonian Product exhibition today.
>
> While they were all away at the conference hall, I wandered around expo
> tables laid with food.
>
> We've got some very beautiful and delicious products: grilled sausages with
> wondrous sauces, and _kholodets_ [jellied meat], and various meat creations,
> and puddings, and _zephir_ [sweets], and cheese breads, […], and juices, and
> marzipans.
>
> When I was done shooting it all, I sat down in the corner on a window sill,
> chewing on a sausage.
>
> A woman in her 60s, dressed in [Estonian] national dress, came up to me: a
> consultant on meat products.
>
> We chatted about various tasty recipes.
>
> Then she heard me speaking on the phone, in Russian.
>
> She said: “Look, I'll feed you now. Because they'll all come running here
> during the break, and there'll be nothing left for you.”
>
> She spoke in Russian to me, even though we communicated in Estonian before
> that.
>
> And – she filled me up with food.
>
> It is really very tasty what we are producing here.
>
> Why am I writing all this.
>
> Any mess begins inside one's head.
>
> When a person sees others as enemies – he is the one who's got problems.
>
> And no doctor is going to help him.
>
> Why is it that I only run into good people, huh?

And here is one of the comments to this post:

> [ _Mir_ ] (both _peace_ and _world_ [these two translations of the Russian

> thing called “state politics” – and one starts feeling like a helpless
> idiot. But then I read your posts and realize that all is okay, the
> [world/peace] is still there, and so are the relations between people. Take
> care of yourself, all of you over there.
