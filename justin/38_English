Violence broke out yet again in East Timor as international security forces
tried to capture rebel leader Alfredo Reinado. Reinado, the former leader of
military police was implicated in the violence last May and was detained but
managed to escape from prison in August with some of his followers. The
fighting took place in mountainous region (to the south of East Timorese
capital Dili) that the rebels were using as a base. Dili was also rocked by
violence when supporters of the rebel leader clashed with the international
peacekeepers in Dili last night.

_Tumbleweed in Asia_ , a long time East Timor resident currently out of the
country writes about the [latest round of
violence](http://timorsunshine.blogspot.com/2007/03/trouble-in-timor-
again.html) in East Timor.

Rumors and uncertainty have fueled violence in the past. _Tumbleweed_ is
concerned about her contacts in East Timor

Australian forces have since then confirmed that four people were killed in
the clashes with the rebels. Dili-gence has updates and advice for other Dili
residents.
