by Veronica Khokhlova)_

Russia's got a new holiday: the Day of Family, Love and Fidelity, [celebrated
on July 8](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/world/europe/09russia.html). In a
post titled “From Russia With (Family) Love,” NBC news producer Yonatan
Pomrenze has
[described](http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/07/08/1187612.aspx)
what the country's newest holiday is about:

> […] The emphasis […] is not on falling in love, as much as keeping people in
> it. […]

[A holiday post](http://eprst2000.livejournal.com/43079.html) (RUS) by Moscow-
based LJ user _eprst2000_ has moved quite a few readers to tears and made it
into the Top 30 of the _Yandex Blogs_ portal:

> Turns out today is some kind of a special holiday, with a long name that
> ends with ‘fidelity.’ The Day of Family, Love and Fidelity. Or something
> like that.
>
> […]
>
> All TV talk shows today solemnly featured families with many children. Some
> with nine, others with 11 kids. […]
>
> And my mother (who works at a maternity ward) said today: “A woman at our
> hospital has given up her twins. Yes. She is 36. Already has an 8-year-old
> daughter.” My mother knows how to cure people who can't describe where the
> pain is because they are only a few days old. And my mother knows. Also, as
> the department's head, she's responsible for talking to women who are giving
> up their children. She has her own words and methods, which are hard to
> convey in text. “And I ask her, – my mother continues, – how can you give
> them up?” – “Well, you see, – says the woman, – I won't be able to provide
> for them. And someone will adopt them and bring them up in a normal way,
> will love them as if they are their own children.” My mother, again: “Do you
> know that normally they do not adopt two children at once? In 99 percent of
> the cases, a couple adopts one child. And according to the current law,
> twins cannot be separated. Especially if it's a girl and a boy. They may
> meet in the future and this may lead to incest. […]” The woman spent a few
> days thinking. And today she has still refused to keep the children. She
> said she thought that the man [children's father] would marry her, but he
> chose not to. He said: “These aren't my children! We've never had any twins
> at all in our family!”
>
> I'm not saying anything as I listen to my mother. And she continues:
> “Recently, an 18-year-old girl gave up her son. I tried to talk to her in
> many different ways, but she looked at me and said: “Do you know that my
> father is the head of this and that region? And my mother works for this and
> that institution? They are well-respected people. You see, I just can't.” –
> “Do the parents know that you are giving up your child?” – “Mama knows.” –
> “And your papa?” – “…” – “So the two of you are afraid to tell your father.
> How come such a man's daughter had a child out of wedlock?” – “…” – “Just
> tell me one thing: why didn't you have an abortion?” – “Am I an idiot or
> what? It's bad for one's health. What if I can't have children in the
> future?”
>
> My mother talks on. In her department, a girl has recently given birth. The
> girl is 25, she is mentally retarded. Her parents came, they are also her
> guardians. Mother is crying, father is moving his jaws so as not to cry.
> Normal, healthy people, it just happened that their girl was born this way.
> She attended a school for kids with special needs, met a boy there. Both are
> around 25, but their development is like in 10-year-olds. Everyone knew they
> were having a relationship. Doctors said that with their condition both were
> definitely sterile and there was nothing to worry about. Explain them about
> condoms, they said.
>
> A boy was born. Not big, but healthy. There is a 90-percent chance that he
> has a similar condition as his parents. The new grandparents came. Crying.
> Filled out the papers certifying that they'll be giving up the boy. They're
> retiring soon, have been pulling her all their lives, ordinary people,
> aren't making thousands of dollars. The girl is getting only [about $100] as
> disability pension. Where else are they supposed to get the money from? When
> we die, who's gonna take care of these three? She can't even take the child
> into her hands, can't wrap him. It'll all fall on us again. And we've spent
> our whole lives like this!!!… How can we take him???
>
> The ended up keeping him.
>
> My mother said that initially they did sign the papers to give him up. And
> then the young mama showed up at the entrance to the newborns department –
> stood there, howling. She can't speak well, so she stood and howled. She got
> her breast milk coming in. Started nursing the baby. Wouldn't let him go. In
> violation of the rules, as an exception, they allowed the baby's father in.
> My mother said the two of them were standing over the child, touching him,
> saying something in their own language. Nurses were swallowing tears as they
> were coming out of the room.
>
> […]
>
> When they were leaving the hospital with the baby, they presented all
> doctors at the maternity ward with a cake. A really huge cake. With these
> words on it: “May God bless you.” My mother said: “And how are you supposed
> to cut something like this?”
