To many people, the name [Darfur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur) is
synonymous with [terror, death and
hopelessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_conflict). Darfur, as we
will soon see, is a very beautiful place despite the human suffering.

We'll start this round up with [some wonderful pictures of Darfur posted by
_Precious_](http://preciouslolo.blogspot.com/2007/04/i-wanna-go.html), a
Sudanese girl in her early 20's who works for an NGO in Sudan:

> Last week in the NGO where I work, they needed someone to go to our office
> in Darfur for some IT job, (Not that I am at the IT Department) but anyway,
> I suggested I would go.. I've always wanted to see other places in Sudan,
> including Darfur, Juba, Kassala and Kadugly..
>
> Unfortunately, My mum did not agree, I begged and plead for hours, no use! I
> was so dissapointed!
>
> The next days when I told my colleagues at work bout my dissapointment, one
> of them showed me these pics taken from his last trip to Kadugly and Abu
> Jebaiha..

_Daana Lost in Translation_ also has [another picture of Darfur](http://daana-

She also blogged [about movies about Africa](http://daana-lost-in-
translation.blogspot.com/2007/04/tia-this-is-africa.html) and commented
specifically on Leonardo Di Caprio's use of the phrase “God forsaken
continent” to describe Africa in the movie [Blood
Diamond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Diamond_\(film\)):

> Also through out the movie he keeps referring to Africa as the God forsaken
> continent, but I call it a man forsaken continent. God did not forsake
> Africa; on the contrary God has embraced Africa, and nourished it with many
> gifts, but man has failed that land with his selfishness and foolishness.

_Nomadic Thoughts_ , a Sudanese living in Tanzania chose to blog an excellent
and amusing post about [the complex world of dating in
Sudan](http://path2hope.blogspot.com/2007/05/games-people-play.html):

> Already the dating scene in Sudan is more complex than politics, once you’re
> seen with someone from the opposite sex on what qualifies as a “date”, know
> that in that moment you have just made history. I have visions of myself
> when I’m a great grandmother and people will still be able to recall the
> names of my ex’s. Taking into account the number of times you had to blow
> off the date because you didn’t want to seem too available/easy, and then
> while you’re on the date you’re recalling all the “do’s and don’ts” that
> your girlfriends made you memorize because in our society you don’t want to
> break the set/acceptable social rules of behavior.

_Black Kush_ brought [Luol
Deng](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/04/shine-deng-shine.html), a
Southern Sudanese Dinka who plays professional basketball with the Chicago
Bulls, to our attention:

> Luol Deng had 26 points, five rebounds, six assists, two steals and one
> block in the Bulls 107-89 game two win over the Heat on Tuesday 24th April.

_Aperadosini_ wrote [an interesting post about choice Vs
predestination](http://aperadosoni.blogspot.com/2007/04/on-fate-faith.html):

> …believing in fate/destiny would make life seem somewhat pointless if your

> no freewill since that will is controlled by a supreme being. This was one

Last but not least, _[Drima, The Sudanese
Thinker](http://www.sudanesethinker.com/2007/04/29/as-world-rallies-for-
darfur-leaders-meet-in-libya-to-discuss-darfur/)_ commented on the [recent
Libyan talks on Darfur](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article21576):

> The heat is on and I believe there is genuine concern. One of the things
> that can really complicate this is the fact that during the last year or so,
> [rebel factions have continued to split
> up](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article21621) into various sub
> factions, each with their own and sometimes conflicting agendas. The rebels
> need to reach a common goal. Fingers crossed.
