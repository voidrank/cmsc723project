Myanmar bloggers are posting videos and pictures of the large protest that
took place earlier today in Yangon, the former capital and the largest city in
Myanmar. The protest was led by Buddhist monks. It is the latest in a series
of month long demonstrations against the military government and was initially
fueled by price rises.
