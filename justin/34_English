![sadr.jpg](/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/sadr.jpg)Two of 32 women activists,
Shadi Sadr (thanks to[ Kosoof](http://kosoof.com/archive/356.php),we can see
her photo here) and Mahboobeh Abassgholizadeh, [who were arrested during a
peace demonstration in Tehran on 4th of
March](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6416789.stm), are still in
prison. The remainder of the jailed women activists were set free.

Sadr is a lawyer and founded Rahi NGO to help women with legal issues.
According to [Women's
Field](http://meydaan.net/showarticle.aspx?arid=212&cid=52) [Fa],authorities
shut down this legal center on Thursday March 15. The same source reports that
Karvarzi Center, another NGO set up to help civil society activists, run by
Abassgholizadeh, was closed by government on the same day too.

One of these jailed women shares her conversation with her interrogator in
prison.

**Interregator and prisoner**

Mahbobeh Hossein Zadeh in her blog, _[Parndeh
Kharzar](http://kharzar.blogfa.com/post-314.aspx)_ [Fa], shares her
experiences and conversation with her interrogator.

> **Interrogator: If you get free about what you will be writing  
>  Blogger: threating, interrogation, psychological torture, humiliation, your
> bad treatment and prison’s bad conditions **  
>  Interrogator:Will you write that we talked about information about your
> life and you became speechless  
>  Blogger: it is not important thing to control people’s telephone  
>  Interrogator: you should praise God that parallel security ( intelligent)
> agents do not interrogate you.

**Tears for jailed mother**

_Omid Memarian_ , blogger and journalist, talked with one of these jailed
women’s daughter and [reported that in his
blog](http://omidmemarian.blogspot.com/2007/03/mahboubeh-abbasgholizadehs-
daughter.html).The blogger says Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh’s daughter, Maryam
Ommi, talked with me about her fears and worries about her mother’s arrest,
investigation, and pertinent follow-ups. Omid's Interview is published in
Roozonline. The blogger asks:

> “Have they questioned any detainees about other individuals such as your
> mother?” She answers: “Yes. The interrogators wanted to separate the others
> from them [these two women]. For example, they have told them not to follow
> these [two] women. Or, they have been asked “what was your relationship with
> these [two] women? What were you doing for them? Why did you go to their
> offices?” They tried to tell the others that these [two] women were after
> self-promotion, but that they are good people, and this type of
> psychological games.”

**Women movement's actions in question**

_[Alpar](http://www.alpr.30morgh.org/archives/005482.php)_ [Fa] who praises
women’s courage says at present, after 8 March, **women activists may analyse
to find out if collecting signatures for women campaign against discrimination
and gradually extend women’s knowledge is not more important than politicizing
and emotionalizing women movement?**

The blogger wonders whether parents now will let their daughters join women
activists?

_[Hoder](http://i.hoder.com/archives/2007/03/070307_015827.shtml)_ writes: The
new confrontational approach by women's activists in Iran can only help the
conservatives in the establishment to paint their activities as a security
threat and after isolating the moderates in the establishment who defend
women's cause, crush the whole movement.

**There is no more choice**

_[Saz Mokhalef](http://www.mokhaalef.blogfa.com/post-118.aspx)_ [Fa] does not
agree that the women's demonstration was revolutionary or violent.The blogger
says: The reformists are in a closed circle where they can only propose voting
and no other protest acts. They ask others not contact foreign press, not to
demonstrate, not to chant slogans and not to carry placards…on other side, the
government continues censorship, puts more pressure on women activists, who
are not permitted to organize meetings in their own homes and who get
fired…Can you tell me what these women are supposed to do?

It seems that **some people still believe that women-related issues are not a
priority and that we should first think about democratization in Iran, and
then who should be made responsible for the suffering and discrimination
millions of women are facing**?

Iranian bloggers’ concerns are not limited only to internal affairs but also
the [Iranian nuclear
crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran) has become a big
concern too. One of their recent concern is Iranian president's Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad [ decision to travel to the United Nations in New York to explain
Iran's nulcear
program](http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/11/iran.nuclear.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest).

**Please don't go but…**

_[Haji Washington](http://hajiwashington.com/blog/1385/12/20/ahmadimoghaddam-
ahmadinejad/)_ [Fa]says please stop Ahmadinejad from coming to the United
Nations. The blogger says his presence will make things worse and it will be a
grave political danger for us. Western countries do not like him. He suggests
that Ali Larijani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council,
makes the trip in his place.

_[Iran
Paprazi](http://www.iranpaparazzi.net/Site.aspx?ParTree=AZIZ&LnkIdn=946)_ [Fa]
says: Somebody stop this brother? He says **countries’ representatives are
there to defend their national interests if you [Ahmadinejad] could have been
able to defend ours, all the world would not be united against us.** You
[Ahmadinejad] think United Nations resolution is just a piece of paper, then
why would you take this long trip…for a piece of paper.

_Mohammad Ali Abtahi_ , a reformist politician, says with each new resolution
against Iran, economic conditions become more dark. He says[ the least
expectation from Ahmadinejad's trip to NewYork is to stop the UN from
approving a new resolution against Iran. If it happens, then it will be a
successful trip](http://www.webneveshteha.com/weblog/?id=2146308598) [Fa].
