This week in the anglophone Moroccan blogosphere, much ado was about [Rachida
Dati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachida_Dati), France's first North African
Justice Minister, appointed on May 18. Dati is a 41-year-old lawyer whose
father is Moroccan and her appointment is causing quite a stir – on the one
hand, it demonstrates that minorities can make it in France, but as
[Liosliath](http://liosliath.com/blog/?p=237) says, “Ms. Dati’s parents
wouldn’t even have been allowed to enter France under Sarkozy’s proposed
immigration policies, and that’s just one of the reasons I find her so
hypocritical. She’s pursued Sarkozy for years, begging to be part of his team
– obviously morals are trumped by career ambition in her case.”

[The View From Fez](http://riadzany.blogspot.com/2007/05/moroccan-reaction-to-
rachida-dati.html) reported on the Moroccan reaction to Dati's appointment:

> While many in France have applauded Rachida Dati's rise to power as French
> Justice Minister, the reaction of the Moroccans and many in the French
> community in Morocco has been muted. “She has no experience and is just
> there to look good,” said one cynical commentator.

[Maghrebism](http://maghrebism.com/2007/05/19/regarding-rachida-dati-and-my-
previous-post/#comment-253) first asked, “Why can’t an immigrant child share
the same views as Sarkozy?” The blogger then argued for Dati, saying:

> Rachida Dati, as an individual and immigrant-child, has all the right to
> agree with Sarkozy’s policies. And Sarkozy has all the right to appoint her,
> without being accused of looking for a posterboy(girl). Maybe he has the
> same reasons for appointing her as the leftist politicians. Because of her
> experience and abilities.  
>  Somehow, immigrant and leftist groups find this hard to believe. Only they
> can claim to have the true immigrant-politicians. All the other ones are
> just poster boys/girls, traitors and weirdos.
>
> This fetishism is ridiculous and restrictive. It’s time we start realizing
> that not all (second-generation) immigrants are the same. That we don’t
> share the same values even though we share the same background.

It turned out to be a week of firsts – after the news of Dati's appointment
broke, another news story – rather, a _newspaper_ came to light. Before this
week, those wishing to read Moroccan news in English could choose between the
state-run news website and a U.S.-backed site. With the release of _The
Casablanca Analyst_ , a new independent weekly, this is no longer the case.
[The View From Fez](http://riadzany.blogspot.com/2007/05/moroccan-newspaper-
in-english.html) reported first, saying:

> For only four Dirhams the reader is offered poetry, analysis, news, comment
> and a book review. Sections of the paper are devoted to Moroccan national
> news and comment, analysis of world affairs, opinion pages, culture,
> language and communications, literature and so on. It is a heady mix and
> certainly provides several hours of enjoyable reading and contemplation.

[The Morocco Report](http://www.moroccosavvy.com/taamarbuuta/2007/05/18/the-
casablanca-analyst/) also praised the newspaper, quoting from its pages and
saying:

> My students remarked that the editors are indeed quite ambitious, and I
> don’t disagree, but that kind of confidence is what they’ll need to succeed
> in a country where even the most popular newspapers only sell around 100,000
> per issue (Morocco’s population is 31 million), and where few people speak
> or read English.
>
> And yet, I’m impressed, because not only are the articles original, but the
> writers seem to remain true to their identities, claiming their perspectives
> as Muslims, humanists, pacifists, environmentalists, nationalists, seekers
> of truth, democrats, lovers of literature and the arts, militants for
> freedom and economists (not in that order).

And for one last exciting first, [Cat in
Rabat](http://catinrabat.blogspot.com/2007/05/little-afternoon-whine-
wine.html) posted about what is probably Morocco's first wine outlet: “Its
location on this particular street … in this particular neighbourhood of Agdal
… in Rabat … in Morocco for that matter … was about as incongruous as a
Carmelite nun at an Al Qaeda bootcamp in the foothills of Afghanistan, but
there it was.”
