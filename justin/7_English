As the holy month of [Ramadan](http://www.answers.com/Ramadan) has just begun,
many Muslims around the world are thinking about charity and those less
fortunate than themselves. Coincidentally, a report recently released in
[_Forbes Magazine_](http://members.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0917/054.html) shows
that King Mohammed VI of Morocco, often referred to as “the king of the poor”
for his initiatives and interest in Morocco's poor, is the 7th richest monarch
in the world, leaving Moroccan bloggers to reflect upon the huge discrepancy
between their king and their average countryman.

[_The Morocco Report_](http://www.moroccosavvy.com/taamarbuuta/2007/09/16/the-
king-makes-how-much/) takes issue with the monarch's spending:

> …King Mohammed VI is the 7th richest royal in the world – while I am left
> here wondering who the first 6 are, the Moroccan monarch’s salary blows my
> mind, but not as much as the amount he apparently spends daily on clothes
> and car repairs: $960,000.
>
> King of the poor my left arm.

Referring to the report,
[_Eatbees_](http://www.eatbees.com/blog/2007/09/14/ramadan-roundup/) says:

> I remember mentioning a similar report to one of my Moroccan friends while I
> was still living there. His response was, “I wish him luck getting to number
> one, because then he might feel he can give some of it back to the rest of
> us.”

The blogger then adds:

> Mohammed VI is popular, professional, and unlike his father, more liked than
> feared. But I can’t help wondering where all that money came from, whether
> monopolizing the nation’s economy had anything to do with it, and whether it
> might be a drain on the nation’s development.

Blogger Hisham from [_The Moroccan Mirror_](http://almiraatblog.blogspot.com/)
commented on the above:

> I’m glad you’ve mentioned the Forbes piece on MVI: $2 billion man! Isn’t
> that obscene. I can’t help feeling disgusted by the sheer hypocrisy of this
> regime. As you’ve suggested: there is a strong attachment to the monarchy as
> an institution but that’s not guaranteed forever, and is surely not a blank
> check for the King and his people to keep on with their lavish and
> extravagant lifestyles.

Of course, with a month of fasting and abstention from vices, Ramadan is a
much talked about subject in the blogoma as well (even from those who do not
fast).

The [_Moroccan
Vocabulary_](http://moroccanvocab.blogspot.com/2007/09/word-92-rmdn.html)
blog, designed to teach a word of _darija_ (Moroccan Arabic) each day, shares
some information on wishing a happy Ramadan in Morocco:

> For religious occasions, Moroccans use the expression “3wâshr mbrôka” عواشر
> مبروكة, which is almost the equivalent of blessed holidays . The answer to
> this is “3lînâ w 3lîk ” علينا و عليك, for us and for you . Funny enough, I
> always –wrongly- use the answer “ Allah ibaârk fîk” الله إيبارك فيك, God
> bless you, which is normally the answer to ”mbrôk” مبروك, congratulations.

[  
_Move it or Lose it_](http://shifaali.blogspot.com/2007/09/day-of-doubt.html)
is frustrated by all the questions she's been asked about her fasting:

> I continue to be offended by how often I get asked if I am fasting,
> following by really? REALLY? Are you sure? When is the last time you ate?
> What time will you eat again?  
>  Fasting is the invisible pillar. Only God really knows, or is supposed to
> know if you are doing it or not.  
>  Yesterday evening I was flipping through my du'a book to make sure I had
> all the biggies memorized, and found the du'a for when someone is bothering
> you when you're fasting:  
>  “I'm fasting, I'm fasting, I'm fasting!”

[_The Moroccan Mirror_](http://almiraatblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/ramadan-
rambling.html) shares a story of what happens when you're caught _not_ fasting
(be sure to go and read the whole story!):

> I think there is a big hypocrisy attached to this issue: while it's not
> considered a big deal for someone not to pray; while people who don't pay
> the Zakat (Muslim alms) are generally ignored, others who don't fast during
> Ramadan run the risk of being ostracized and stigmatized. I witnessed my
> self, during my years of study in Casablanca, many instances of that.

Finally, Bill Day from [_the a la
menthe_](http://www.williamsonday.com/morocco/archives/2007/09/ramadanrosh-
has.html) wishes happy holidays to _everyone_ :

> Only someone who has experienced Ramadan can appreciate the camaraderie of
> breaking fast together at the end of the day over harira, dates, and
> shebekia. And for Jews, today marks the beginning of the New Year,
> traditionally celebrated with sweets for a “sweet” new year. Ramadan karim,
> happy Rosh Hashanah, and may we all live more harmoniously together as we
> celebrate our differences in the coming months and years.
