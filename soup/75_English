The president of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiev declared that American airbase
will be called off Kyrgyzstan. Political intrigues around the airbase began
when Bakiev became the president of Kyrgyzstan. The question about the base
withdrawal was [raised](http://kyrgyzstan.neweurasia.net/2009/01/16/another-
withdrawal-of-the-american-airbase/) _[en]_ before every trip of the Kyrgyz
president to Moscow. However, this February trip became decisive.

**A Little History**  
  
The American air base “Manas” began the work in December, 2001, according to
the intergovernmental agreement. Originally named in the honor of the head of
the New York fire service Peter Gansi. According to the American legislation,
military bases outside of the USA can't be named in the honor of the American
citizens, that's why the airbase was renamed to “Manas” (the epic famous
Kyrgyz hero). The main task of the base are the transmission of soldiers and
cargoes to Afghanistan and back, and fuel service in the sky over Afghanistan.

**Officially**

On February, 3rd, Bakiev declared about future withdrawal of the American
airbase from Kyrgyzstan after the negotiations with the president of Russia
Dmitry Medvedev.

> “Recently the Kyrgyz government decided to terminate the agreement about the
> stay terms of the American airbase in Kyrgyzstan.This decision will be
> announced soon”, – Bakiev told.

The Kyrgyz president noticed that the USA didn't satisfy the financial
conditions of Kyrgyzstan to base stay. There was also a negative social
resonance about the airbase stay.

Next day, on February, 4th, the government of Kyrgyzstan approved and directed
to the parliament the law project has officially declared that they hadn't
received the formal notification about the decision to close the base.

> “We have been in discussion with Kyrgyz authorities on the future of Manas
> Air Base. These discussions will continue. At this point we have not
> received formal notification of a decision by Kyrgyzstan to close the base.
> We have a broad range of programs and interests we will continue to pursue
> with the government and people of Kyrgyzstan, –
> [said](http://bishkek.usembassy.gov/) _[en]_ in the press-release of the
> American embassy in Kyrgyzstan.

**Expert's Opinions**

The political scientist Nur Omarov doubts that the American airbase will be
called off Kyrgyzstan.

> “There are some serious evidences that the American air base won't be made
> go out. There is the trusted information that the statement sounded last
> night has the certain forced character. I think, within next few days Bakiev
> will meet a number of the high-ranking officials of the USA. They will
> convince him to refuse the present position”, – Omarov

The political scientist Marat Kazakpaev considers this decision as wrong,
because the USA were for Kyrgyzstan the strategic ally in region.

> «The USA is the world power. It has a great potential. We have the big
> humanitarian and economic help, a lot of grants for the non-governmental
> organizations. It was a good cooperation. The airbase also concerned
> military operations in Afghanistan. It is necessary to hold base untill the
> situation in Afghanistan completely will be stable. Besides everybody knows
> that Kyrgyzstan joined voluntary to the international anti terrorist
> operation in 2001, and provided the base”, – Kazakpaev

One of leaders of opposition and the director of Institute of freedom and
human rights Topchubek Turgunaliev is against the airbase withdrawal.

> “Kyrgyzstan is in the depressing situation now. After that decision our
> relations not only with the USA, but also many west countries will worsen”,
> – Turgunaliev [thought](http://www.24.kg/politic/2009/02/04/105251.html)
