Over the past few years since her first book, a collection of intertwined
short stories entitled _Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits_ , was released,
Laila Lalami has emerged as one of Morocco's best known authors. As few
Moroccan writers’ work is translated into English, and even fewer female

Lalami is also a blogger who is often quoted by Global Voices. In a recent

The book will be available on April 21, 2009.
