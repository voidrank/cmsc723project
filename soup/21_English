Andrei Khrapavitski [reports](http://belarus.blogsome.com/2009/11/05/p243/) on
problems faced by a Belarusian political party following the election of a new
leader: “[According to the Belarusian
blogosphere](http://insurhent.livejournal.com/87113.html), a webmaster, loyal
to the previous leader, is refusing to pass passwords and website requisites
to the new team. Thus they can’t update the party website. […] What if Bush
web team refused to pass control to Obama’s team over whitehouse.gov?”
