[Eid Mubarak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_Mubarak)!
[Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim) [across the
world](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/09/30/arabeyes-snapshots-of-eid/)
are today celebrating [Eid ul-Fitr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr),
the holiday that marks the end of
[Ramadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan), the Islamic holy month of
fasting – and [the Caribbean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) is no
exception. A few bloggers were at their computers bright and early to mark the
occasion…

[Lily](http://lilandra.com/blog/archives/2008/09/30/id-mubarak-moon-sighted/),
from Trinidad and Tobago, was excited at the [sighting of the
moon](http://islam.about.com/od/ramadan/a/moonsighting.htm), while
[Chennette](http://chennette.net/2008/09/30/eid-mubarak/) is celebrating Eid
in neighbouring [Guyana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana):

> It’s officially ‘Id ul Fitr, the end of Ramadan and one of the 2
> Eids/celebrations for Muslims. Eid Mubarak everyone!

_Simply Trini Cooking_ is glad for another public holiday to “stay home and
relax” – the irony is, he's busy in the kitchen, whipping up some
_[Sawine](http://www.guardian.co.tt/archives/2004-11-13/features1.html)_ ,
which he describes as “not a drink yet we slurp it down in cups, but then it's
not even porridge because it has vermicelli in it. Confusing as it may seem,
this is one sweet delicacy I look forward to every Eid.” For anyone who wants
to try it, he posts a helpful recipe.

Fellow blogger
_[Coffeewallah](http://coffeewallah.blogspot.com/2008/10/public-holy-
day.html)_ notes that in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society like
[Trinidad and Tobago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago),
holidays like this are the norm, but she is saddened by the circumstances
surrounding her family's celebration of the occasion:

> Given that I am of mixed heritage, today actually constitutes a religious
> holiday for my mother's family, so I get to go “home” and make nice with the
> relatives. My granny is probably slaving away over a hot stove while I
> write; this prior to heading off to the mosque where she'll meet up with her
> fellow survivors, she's 84, her friends are dying off, before heading back
> home for another round of quick kitchen activity. Since my mother is dead
> and she has no more daughters…I'm it. Her company while she cooks, reluctant
> sous chef, because I cannot do it the way she wants, my cooking style is
> very different. I'm not resentful, just too tired. My female cousins are
> notably absent, and this is hard for her to take, she who is used to large
> families and lots of people, whose family gatherings have now shrunk…
>
> We, those of us left, will briefly congregate in the kitchen, to eat
> together before jumping up to go where ever else. I feel sad for her, this
> is not what she envisaged. Where are the eight children that she raised,
> where are the grandchildren and where are her great grandchildren? No
> childish voices raised, nobody running underfoot, no hive of activity,
> instead we have scattered all over, been visited by death and divorce. Today
> she will have a heading to middle aged, unmarried childless granddaughter,
> itching to get back home to catch a few z's before work tomorrow; phone
> calls from my uncle, brothers and cousin living abroad, her friends who
> didn't make it out and her surviving sisters. And she will be happy, even
> for this.
>
> So for her, may I wish all of you, Eid Murabak, take the time out to enjoy
> your life, enjoy your family, be happy.
