Pakistanis are using blogs as a medium to raise their voices about an
important issue regarding the biases of technology giant Google. The issue we
are talking about is Google Doodles for Pakistan. [Google
Doodles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Doodle) refers to the Google's
logo designs project that Google displays occasionally. Google celebrates and
pays tribute to certain world festivals, events and personalities using these
doodles. But never have we seen doodles for famous Pakistani or Muslim
festivals. Some major festivals like Eid and Ramadan are celebrated across the
entire Muslim world.

Bloggers are having different views and opinions regarding reasons and
suggestions. The voice was first raised by _Bites85_ at
[ProPakistani](http://www.propakistani.com/2008/09/17/google-is-biased/),
later supported by many bloggers. Let's see what Pakistani bloggers are
saying:

On the other hand, some bloggers are bit polite and expressing their views
that it might be the reason that Google doesn't want to get into any cartoon
controversy.

Here is what [Teeth Maestro](http://www.teeth.com.pk/blog/2008/09/23/google-
doodle-muslims-pakistanis) has to say:

Google services have won the hearts of many Pakistani and Muslim internet
users. Many prefer Google's services over its competitors. Therefore, it
doesn't go with the Google's image to be biased to any community. So I hope
Google will listen to us and will place an Eid Doodle this time :)
