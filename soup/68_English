The week gone has been a politically hot one for many Malawians as they have
seen their [presidential and parliamentary
candidates](http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/2659.html) present their
nominations papers to the Malawi Electoral Commission ahead of the May 19
polls. By the end of the exercise, about 8 presidential and over 500
parliamentary candidates presented their nomination papers to compete for the
193 seats in parliament.

Journalist **Kondwani Munthali** earlier on shared his views on the political
developments which are expected to lead to the most contested at both
presidential and parliamentary levels. He writes [Viva My Country's
Democracy](http://munthalikondwani.blogspot.com/2009/02/viva-my-countrys-
democracy.html):

> Yes, I said DPP has no structures to manage itself through primaries, I am
> glad two Ministers recalled my discussions with them and called me. For UDF
> how they can managed the situation of Muluzi will be entirely to them. For
> MCP it seems they have changed indeed, the guys look serious enough to upset
> tables. For today thats where it ends

Another blogger under **Ndagha** agrees with Munthali that Malawi's politics
this year is [getting hotter](http://ndagha.blogspot.com/2009/02/politics-
getting-hot-in-malawi.html). He hope that its players have a genuine heart for
the Malawians and not necessarily to serve their own interests. He says that
for him this year offers hope. How and why?:

> For me, the parliamentary race will the most exciting as it will showcase
> lots of new entrants-most of whom in my view can make important
> contributions to the country's development. I wish we had popular new faces
> on the presidential race.

Another journalist Mzati Nkolokosa terms this political time in Malawi as a
Season of Rumors. He writes a long post focusing on Brown Mpinganjira who has
dumped the party he helped to form and paired himself with John Tembo of the
Malawi Congress Party as a running mate.

> **It is right to call this period a[season of
> rumours](http://mzatinkolokosa.blogspot.com/2009/01/season-of-rumours.html).
> But Brown Mpinganjira must go on to accept that crucial political truths in
> Malawi start as rumours.**

> Brown Mpinganjira, the cleverest politician in Malawi according to Jack
> Mapanje, is good at communication. He knows words that are loaded with

Most Malawi's public offices are not fully computerised. While there are some
efforts to improve this, it remains a challenge to most government departments
and agencies. One of the offices that serves lots of Malawians is the office
of the Administrator General where among others, clients are helped with
services regarding their deceased estate.

Having attended a short course on data entry, journalist [**Pauline
Kalumikiza**](http://allsmiles-stella.blogspot.com/2009/02/lets-go-
digital.html) writes on the importance of such offices going
[digital](http://allsmiles-stella.blogspot.com/2009/02/lets-go-digital.html):

> The reason is that, it takes so long for them to help the benefiaries due to
> their manual storage. I think it is laborious and time consuming, because
> they handle multiple of files so them to take out one, it takes ages.  
>  Most of the times, they will tell you that ‘Sorry come next month, give us

> he should wait for another week, very frustrating isn’t it?
>
> Yes technology has its own disadvantages but I think, the AG’s office would

>  We cannot be talking of making ICT accessible to everyone, if our important
> offices that hold crucial information are still using manual storage system.
> Zisinthe! (Let things change!)
