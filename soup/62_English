Dubai has denied Israeli female tennis star Shahar Peer a visa to play in the
Dubai Tennis Championships, while her male colleague Andy Ram, was able to
receive one. “There might have been some logic as to why Ms. Peer was not
allowed to play, at least in some circles, due to political and cultural norms
on the part of the Dubai government and the tournament organizers. But this
situation has changed dramatically with the allowing of Andy Ram  
to play, making one wonder if Peer’s ouster was simply because she is a
woman!” writes [_One
