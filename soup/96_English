Although the Lebanese media and bloggers in general are focusing on political
topics lately, it is refreshing to see other issues being discussed and
reported. But again, as soon as such reports are published, it turns out is it
even more bad news. International organizations such as _Human Rights Watch_
(HRW), _Immigration Here & There_ and regional bloggers are publishing
alarming [reports](http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/25/lebano19690.htm)
about the abuse of foreign maids in the
[_region_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/12/saudi-arabia-slavery-in-
the-gulf/) and lately in Lebanon, where reportedly 200,000 maids are legally
employed. And with the absence of media coverage of these reports and the lack
of attention from official departments in Lebanon, bloggers are taking action
to raise awareness online.

_Moussa Bachir_ uses his
[blog’s](http://urshalim.blogspot.com/2008/08/lebanon-migrant-domestic-
workers-die-at.html) space this week to promote what Human Rights Watch has to
say about the maids’ situation in Lebanon, which includes:

> “Domestic workers are dying in Lebanon at a rate of more than one per week,”
> said Nadim Houry, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “All those
> involved – from the Lebanese authorities, to the workers’ embassies, to the
> employment agencies, to the employers – need to ask themselves what is
> driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape
> from high buildings.”

[_Lebanese Socialist_](http://sursock.blogspot.com/2008/08/suicides.html) also
sheds light on the same report by Human Rights Watch:

> HRW said that at least 24 housemaids have died since January 2007 after
> falling from multi-storey buildings. “Many domestic workers are literally
> being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement,”
> Houry said.

_Christa Hillstrom_ , who dedicates her blog to the danger and the truth of
the modern global slave trade, [says](http://humangoods.net/2008/05/24/stop-
by-the-market-on-your-way-home-in-lebanon-and-pick-up-a-filipina-housemaid/):

> Although the women often come through legal agencies and are somewhat
> trained for the domestic work, they frequently have their passports
> confiscated when they arrive and suffer physical and sexual abuse.

The disturbing news continues when Hillstorm quotes Elise Barthet’s report on
the situation :

> Beirut employment agencies promote them as merchandise or, in extreme case,
> as pets. They offer advice about which nationalities are supposedly docile,
> easy to maintain or “harder to break.”

Digging back in time, we can find many bloggers as _Moustafa_ who previously
[_posted_](http://beirutspring.com/blog/2008/05/05/ethiopia-bans-its-citizens-
from-working-in-abusive-lebanon/) his concerns over this growing phenomenon:

> Sure they’re starving and living in miserable conditions, but that doesn’t
> mean that they have to put up with the ultimate abusive environment: The
> Lebanese household.

Professor [Asad Abu
Khalil](http://angryarab.blogspot.com/2008/08/finally.html) at the _Angry Arab
News Service_ finds it a relief that the situation is getting international
attention from HRW:

> Finally. Human Rights Watch has noticed.

A few months ago Prof Abu Khalil published an article that tackles the maids’
situation in Lebanon, which was later
[_posted_](http://dailyalochona.blogspot.com/2008/05/alochona-maids-in-
lebanon.html) at _Daily Online Alcohona_ :

> I will never forget Sushar Roxi. Do you remember her? That poor Sri Lankan
> maid who died by hanging in front of spectators and cameras. Do you remember
> when the city of Sidon's people woke up to find her dangling from the
> balcony, after she'd hanged herself with linens? Do you wonder why she
> hanged herself? Do you wish you could ask her? She dangled from the balcony
> for hours and nobody noticed or cared. Why did Sushar hang from the balcony
> and why do we never hear of investigations?

An earlier post by _Abullor_
[promotes](http://biladsham.blogspot.com/2008/05/maid-in-lebanon-ii-voices-
from-home.html) a documentary (Maid in Lebanon II) that debates workers’
rights, employment, contracts and everyday terms and conditions of work.

Another alarming sign that went largely unnoticed was
[mentioned](http://lebanoniznogood.blogspot.com/2008/05/bravo-ethiopia-end-
maid-trade-with.html) by _Hanibaal_ a few months ago. His post focuses on a
bill passed by the Ethiopian government that bans works from traveling to
Beirut:

> …Ethiopia passed the bill after it conducted a thorough analysis into the
> human right violations and domestic violence Ethiopian migrants face behind
> closed doors in Lebanon while in duty as maids.  
>  …Past human right records show that 67 Ethiopian women died between 1997
> and 1999 alone in Beirut while working. Many were never heard from again and
> many others remain very difficult to trace because their employers change
> their Christian name to let them in to the country as Muslims.
