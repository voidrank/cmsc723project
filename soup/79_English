Richard Barrow notes that it is sometimes confusing to understand the time in
Thailand. And so he explains the unique [“Thai Time” system](http://www.thai-
blogs.com/index.php/2008/12/27/how-to-tell-the-time-in-thailand?blog=5). For
example, “If a Thai person tells you that the bus will leave at two o'clock,
then don't presume that he means 2 o'clock in the afternoon. He could mean 8
o'clock in the morning.”
