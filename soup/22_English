Barbadian [bloggers](http://keltruthblog.com/blog/?p=559) are all over the
story of a man claiming “he woke up in the morgue of the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital after being declared dead”: _[Barbados Free
Press](http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/night-of-the-living-
dead-in-barbados/)_ : “It would be nice if Barbados reporters started asking
some questions instead of ingesting and regurgitating whatever garbage is
tossed their way”; _[Barbados
Underground](http://bajan.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/is-the-local-media-turning-
the-corner/)_ : “The bigger point to this story is to recognize the power of
the media to excite its public.”
