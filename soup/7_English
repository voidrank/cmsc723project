[Do you know the paper-eating goats of
Niger?](http://www.gefominyen.com/2010/05/nigers-paper-eating-goats.html): “I
noticed that inhabitants of Niamey ate a lot of grilled goat or sheep meat. A
friend invited me to one of these joints where I savoured African-style
barbecued goat. Since I was in Niamey to cover the food crisis which also
involved a deficit of 16 million tonnes of fodder for livestock, I couldn't
help asking what these particular goats had been eating to be so fleshy and
juicy.”
