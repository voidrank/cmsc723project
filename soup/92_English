[_L'actualite de Cote d'Ivoire_](http://actualiteci.ivoire-
blog.com/archive/2008/09/02/le-proces-des-dechets-toxiques-s-ouvre-ce-
mois.html) writes that twelve people, including the head of Tommy, a local
waste processing company, are set to appear before a court in Abidjan later
this month; they are charged with “poisoning or conspiracy to poison” for
[illegally dumping 500 tons of toxic
waste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Ivory_Coast_toxic_waste_spill). Tommy
was under contract with [Trafigura](http://www.trafigura.com/), a Dutch energy
company, to process the waste after Trafigura decided it was too expensive to
process in Amsterdam.
