_Eagle and the Bear_
[writes](http://eagleandthebear.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/how-to-rob-the-
russian-national-library/) about what it's like to be doing research at the
Russian National Library in St. Petersburg: “The security at the library is as
tight as a supermax prison, the rules for visiting are just as strict, and the
staff is about as friendly as a bunch of shotgun-wielding wardens.”
