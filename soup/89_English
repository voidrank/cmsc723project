Camilo Uribe [writes about an illegal downloaded MP3 file found on the
Colombian police's website [es]](http://kmilo0.blogspot.com/2008/09/la-
policia-tambien-le-gusta-la.html), after which they used a password to cover
it up, but didn't remove the file. This is after they destroyed more than 70
thousand pirated dvds, cds and mp3s in the city of Medellin. A screen grab of
the file is included.
