You may have missed out on the fumbling around with the translation headsets,
but if you weren't able to join us for the first day of the Global Voices 2010
Citizen Media Summit in Santiago Chile, you definitely have not missed out on
the global conversation!

Session notes have been posted on the [summit
blog](https://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org/) (and we are encouraging post
comments in order to keep those conversations flowing), photos have been
posted on [_Flickr_](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=gv2010), and [_Twitter_
](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=gv2010)has been tweeting away about the
summit……follow the hashtag of #gv2010 and you'll see more of the conference
than if you were watching our [livestream
feed](https://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org/program/video/) of the
proceedings.

A couple of highlights from yesterday include presentations from Rising Voices
projects [_Ceasefire Liberia_](http://www.ceasefireliberia.com/) and [_Nomad
Green_](http://www.nomadgreen.com/), and the announcement of the winners of
the [Breaking Borders ](http://breakingborders.net/)Competition!
