highlights](http://gisforghana.blogspot.com/2009/10/ghana-highlights-
part-1-accra-to.html): In Ghana, every region has something to offer. Culture,
history, beaches, flora and fauna, you can sample it all over the country,
from the tropical jungles of the south to the savannah plains of the north. If
you’re a beach or history lover, you’ll enjoy this tour along the coast.
