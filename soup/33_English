_Cerno_ [tells](http://cerno.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/social-function-of-
astrologers-sri-lanka/) that the social utility of astrologers in Sri Lanka

destiny amidst the amplified uncertainties of living in a third world country.

mental/physical illness, entering your child into a ‘Good Colombo School’
[..].”
