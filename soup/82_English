A few weeks after confirming the [hijacking of an Egyptian ship by pirates of
Somalia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/03/egypt-ship-hijacked-by-the-
pirates/), _Zeinobia_ reminds us again with the current status.  
On one hand, according to the crew's families, [negotiations have
stopped](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2009/01/save-blue-star-and-
search-for-badr.html) regarding the ransom because the pirates refuse to lower
it and because the owners of the ship, the “Blue Marine” company, are refusing
to pay more than $100,000. Additionally, the food rations on board for the
crew ran out over a week ago and there is no medical care for a crew member
who was shot in his leg by the pirates.  
On the other hand, the pirates already
[announced](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2009/01/in-less-
than-48-hours.html#comment-form) that they will blow the ship if their demands
are not met by Saturday.

> The pirates already announced tomorrow Saturday as a deadline ,if their
> demands are not met , they will blow the ship !! Yes in less than 48 hours
> the Blue star ship will be bombed and its crew will be killed if the demands
> of the Somali pirates are not met  
>  Yesterday Thursday the families of the crew protested in front of the Blue
> Marine Company in the middle of Alexandria over the news that the company
> will abandon the ship

She further questions the Egyptian foreign ministry’s rule, as well who is
responsible for this:

> There 28 crew members on the board of the Blue star  
>  I do not know where the hell is the Foreign Ministry?? Where are our army
> and our navy?? where are our naval special forces ??  
>  I pray to God that the crew members return back to their families safe and
> the company gives the pirates the ransom they want even if they have to sell
> the company itself , we are talking about people , if those 28 crew members
> are killed their blood will be distributed equally between Blue Marine Co.,
> Foreign Ministry ,the Egyptian Navy and any party who can help them in this
> crisis and did not do it.
