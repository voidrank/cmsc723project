This morning, it was [reported](http://www.hespress.com/) by the electronic
news site _Hespress_ [ar] that blogger [Mohammed
Raji](http://almassae.maktoobblog.com/) was arrested in his home in Agadir. An
[article](http://hespress.com/article-erraji.html) that Raji had posted on
_Hespress_ [ar] is said to be the source of the conflict, though neither that
fact nor Raji's arrest have been confirmed outside of the blogosphere.

Morocco's [often-
critized](http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/mideast/morocco06apr07na.html) press
law prohibits criticizing of the monarchy; In Raji's article, which has been
translated [here](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/09/08/morocco-the-post-
that-led-mohammah-erraji-to-jail/) by Amira al Hussaini, he claims that the
King's charity toward his people encourages them to remain helpless rather
than work hard. His concluding paragraph reads:

> وعندما يرى ولي العهد الصغير الذي سيتولى الحكم في يوم من الأيام كيف أن والده
> يوزع الهبات والاكراميات والكريمات على الناس بمجرد سماع كلمة إطراء أو مدح ،
> فلا شك أنه سيتصرف بنفس “المنطق” عندما يحكم ، لذلك فما علينا سوى أن نؤجل
> أحلامنا بمغرب المساواة وتكافؤ الفرص لغاية حكم الملك محمد السابع الذي سيأتي
> بعد الحسن الثالث اللي هو ولي العهد حاليا!

When the young Crown Prince, who will become the Ruler one day, witnesses how
his father distributes honours, gratuities and gifts to people upon hearing
compliments and praise, there is no doubt that he will act based on the same
logic, when he rules. This is why we should delay our dreams of a Morocco of
equality and equal opportunities until the reign of Mohammad the Seventh,
which will follow after Hassan the Third, who is the Crown Prince at present.

_A Moroccan About the World Around Him_
[explains](http://cabalamuse.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/why-i-think-erraji-was-
arrested/) the context of the article, saying:

> Mohamed’s article, written in Arabic and titled “The King Indulges His
> Subjects’ dependency,” dealt with the concept of what Moroccans colloquially
> call “GRIMA”, from the French word “agrément” meaning “an administrative
> authorization.” Giving ”administrative authorizations” has been a long
> standing royal tradition in Morocco. Needless to say, such authorizations
> allow the beneficiary to bypass all set administrative procedures; they
> discredit all laws and regulations designed to regulate such procedures. But
> the concept is so ingrained in the Moroccan psyche that you often here
> Moroccans from all walks of life pray: “May Allah give us a “GRIMA” from
> Sidna.”

[Larbi](http://www.larbi.org/post/2008/09/Bloggeur-marocain-interpelle) [fr]
have covered the story as well.

_Hespress_ has reported that Raji has already been given an expedited hearing
and judgement and was sentenced to 2 years in jail as well as fined MAD 5,000
(USD $625). _Larbi_ [explains](http://www.larbi.org/post/2008/09/Deux-ans-de-
prison-ferme-pour-un-bloggeur-marocain):

> Dans un jugement expéditif digne des pays les plus totalitaires au monde, le
> Tribunal d’Agadir a condamné ce lundi le bloggeur marocain Mohamed Erraji à
> deux ans de prison ferme et 5000 Dhs d’amendes pour « manquement au respect
> dû au roi ».

In an expedited trial worthy of the most totalitarian countries in the world,
the Agadir tribunal has sentenced Moroccan blogger Mohammed Erraji to 2 years
in prison and a 5000dhs fine for “failure of respect due to the King”

A petition for Mohammed Raji's freedom has already been posted
[here](http://helperraji.com/) and a [Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=30771925854) has been created.
