Do the colours you wear reflect your personality? _[The Arab
Observer](http://thearabobserver.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-much-you-reflect-of-
your-self-in.html)_ brings up this issue in a rather interesting post:

_[Lass](http://ammanrevisited.blogspot.com/2009/02/new-city-of-amman-logo-
acquired-taste.html)_ brings up the Amman city logo, which Global Voices
[reported on](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/24/jordan-the-queens-
vlog-internet-socio-economics-new-social-web-networking-and-ammans-new-logo/)
when it was still in its development stages, now that it has been selected:

> The city logo is something that is linked to a city like a name to a person,

> Changing the logo of the city is an effort that GAM should be applauded for

And _[kinzi](http://kinziblogs.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/why-not-charge-
traffic-violators-more/)_ brings up an important issue for Jordan, and that is
traffic violations, which yields many deaths annually:

> Am I missing something here? An important detail? Some cultural cue? Some
> tradition that went under my radar?
>
> Traffic violators cause trouble for everyone on the roads. They should have
> to pay for it.

> But of course, I guess we wouldnâ€™t want anyone having to own responsibility
> for their own bad behaviour, it might be shameful.
