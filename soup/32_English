jamaican-road-trip.html)_ says that a recent road trip across Jamaica has been
like saying goodbye to so many natural treasures: “I have been an advocate for
the natural environment for more than twenty years…and now I must face the
fact that still, after all the effort, our natural resources are put on the
auction block…and the price we accept for our irreplaceable assets is a rock
bottom, last chance sale price, a going out of business giveaway.”
