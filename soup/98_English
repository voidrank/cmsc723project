Palestinians are rejoicing today in the [release of 199
prisoners](http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=13049&size=A) from
Israeli prisons. The [release was
announced](http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKLI11166520080818) last
Monday, and was likely timed according to [Condoleezza
Rice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice)‘s [arrival in
Israel](http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iK_BJbxzwNG3j_6g_mWi_B5Awtwg).

The release process was held up several times by the Israeli cabinet, which
held three separate votes on the issue. Among the freed prisoners were Said
al-Attaba, Israel's longest serving Palestinian, imprisoned in 1977, and
Mohammed Ibrahim Abu Ali, imprisoned in 1979.

_body on the line_ was in Nablus for the welcome celebrations and compared
them to [Samir Kuntar's
welcome](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/07/16/lebanon-return-of-
prisoners/) this past July. The blogger
[wrote](http://bodyontheline.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/on-prisoners-prisons-
and-imprisonment/):

> We waited in the sweltering heat for a few hours (Huwara, by the way, is at
> most a 10 minute drive from downtown Nablus). It reminded me of going to
> Samir Quntar’s welcome home festivities this summer, although Hezbollah had
> chairs for us and fabulous live band (though here we were not getting hit on
> the head by people waving their flags). But here I could get much closer to
> the stage, it was not sex segregated, and the crowd was much smaller (I
> don’t even think the entire crowd in Dahiyaa that day would be able to fit
> in downtown Nablus). A friend of mine later joined us and I kept hearing
> people complain about the heat. True, it was unbelievably hot; but I kept
> thinking about all the torture and living hell these men had endured–one for
> 32 years–and I thought the least we can do is stand here and give them a
> hero’s welcome.

The blogger also remembered the prisoners who were not released:

> Of course the most famous political prisoners were not released today from
> their torture chambers: [Marwan
> Barghouti](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3587336,00.html) and
> [Ahmad Sa’adat](http://www.freeahmadsaadat.org/). There was a huge poster in
> downtown Nablus (see below) about Sa’adat. And of course of the rest of the
> 10,000+ prisoners in Israeli jails must be remembered. But it also must be
> remembered that EVERY NIGHT Israeli Terrorist Forces (ITF) kidnap and
> imprison Palestinian political prisoners. My friend Mustafa, who lives in
> the old city of Nablus, tells me every day about stories of the ITF coming
> in with bombs and guns and terrorizing families. In a way, the old city of
> Nablus is kind of like a refugee camp in that way. It is one of the many
> sites that gets invaded nightly. [Yesterday 9 Palestinians were kidnapped
> from various West Bank Cities, for
> instance](http://www.imemc.org/article/56707).

The story was accompanied by the blogger's own photographs, including this
