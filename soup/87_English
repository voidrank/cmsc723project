Egypt's special athletes are making waves in Beijing, China, where this year's
Paralympic Games are being held from September 6 to 17. While Egypt clinched
one bronze medal in this year's Beijing Summer Olympics, athletes in the
Paralympics are achieving a success like no other. So far the team has won
four gold, three silver and four bronze medals.
