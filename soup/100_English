_Nomadic Morocco_
[remarks](http://nomadicmorocco.blogspot.com/2008/08/daylight-savings-
time.html) upon Morocco's decision to roll back the clocks early. The country,
which instituted Daylight Savings Time this summer for the first time in
several years, is changing the clocks this week just in time for Ramadan.
