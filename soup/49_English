This week, the talk in the blogoma seems to be about all things edible.
[Moroccan cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_cuisine), widely
considered one of the most complex and best in the world, is derived from
Arab, Spanish, Turkish, Jewish, and native Amazigh culinary traditions and is
well-known for its use of vegetables and spices.

The blogger behind _A Moroccan Kitchen_ is well aware of that fact; the blog,
run by the two Moroccan chefs of Riad Laaroussa in Fez, [shares
recipes](http://moroccankitchen.blogspot.com/2009/02/la-harira-fassia.html)
from the riad's weekly menu:

> Aujourd’hui il fait beau, c'est le moment pour faire une pique-nique : le
> soleil, la verdure, l'amour et la joie.
>
> Alors suite à la demande d'un client du Riad Mr Francis on va faire la
> harira fassia

Today the weather is nice, it's time for a picnic: the sun, the vegetation,
love and joy.
