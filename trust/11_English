[James Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson), an American
Nobel Prize-winning geneticist, [provoked international
outrage](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2697559.ece)
when the following statements of his were quoted in the [Oct. 14
profile](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2630748.ece)
in The Sunday Times:

> He says that he is “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because
> “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is
> the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really”, and I know that
> this “hot potato” is going to be difficult to address. His hope is that
> everyone is equal, but he counters that “people who have to deal with black
> employees find this not true”. He says that you should not discriminate on
> the basis of colour, because “there are many people of colour who are very
> talented, but don’t promote them when they haven’t succeeded at the lower
> level”. He writes that “there is no firm reason to anticipate that the
> intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their
> evolution should prove to have evolved identically. Our wanting to reserve
> equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be
> enough to make it so”.

The news of the controversy has produced a certain stir in the Russian-
language blogosphere, too.

U.S.-based LJ user _karial_
[recounted](http://karial.livejournal.com/148181.html) (RUS) meeting James
Watson in person:

> […] I met Watson two weeks after 9/11. The first question he asked after
> introductions and hand-shaking was: “So, are we [the U.S.] going to
> Afghanistan now to finish off what you guys [the Soviets] haven't?”

> […]

> I had been warned about Watson's habit of saying politically incorrect
> things. I had to sit with a microphone in my hands throughout his lecture,
> ready to stand up and say that the company that organized this seminar
> didn't share Mr. Watson's views. No, I don't find the role of a censor
> pleasant – I find it amazingly disgusting – and I really hoped to avoid
> becoming one. But, unfortunately, we could face a lawsuit otherwise.
