Environmental blogs around the world are addressing a myriad issues specific
to their region, but of global concern. In DRC the _Gorilla Protection_ blog
is pondering what a peace deal would mean for Gorillas. From _China Dialogue_
, a look at what is next after the Bali climate change conference, and from
South Africa, we have reactions to the recent power shortages and an eco-car
competition.

Starting in the DRC, the [_Gorilla Protection_ blog
writes](http://wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/gorilla/2008/01/23/what-does-the-
peace-deal-in-eastern-drc-mean-for-the-gorilla-sector/) about the [peace
deal](http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/177425,eastern-congo-rebels-
government-sign-peace-deal.html) that could end years of war and conflict in
DRC. The post includes snippets of Virunga wildlife preserve ranger's opinions
and thoughts on the practical implications of the deal on gorilla protection
efforts.

> There are Rangers who, after 2 decades of conflict, view the situation with
> skepticism, and say that peace on the terms proposed will simply not last.
> When I ask them if this is all going to work, I hear “Je ne crois pas” very
> often. That is “I don’t think so“.  
>  And there are many, who are tired, very tired. They want to move on. They
> want to work. They want to go home. And so they hope it will stick.

On the blog [_China
Dialogue_](http://www.chinadialogue.net/homepage/show/single/en/1640), _Feng
Gao_ writes of his optimism about conditions around ‘the road ahead from
Bali'; saying:

> The details of the two-year negotiation process are unclear, and there is
> much that needs to be discussed and confirmed. It is too early to predict
> the outcome of the negotiations, but the positive start we wanted to see is
> surely here. From this hopeful beginning, the world can enter a new era of
> global action on climate change.

Please note that some background information is available from last month's
Global Voices coverage of the [Climate Change conference in
Bali](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/climate-
change-2007/).

Energy and environment are closely linked, as is shown by the _Gorilla
Potection_ blog, writing about how its rangers were beaten up when they
stopped a truck carrying illegal charcoal. Charcoal is used as fuel for
cooking by many in rural Africa and the problem of energy is persistent in
most rural areas. The post includes photos of the trucks, the injured rangers
and [more details on what
happened.](http://wildlifedirect.org/blogAdmin/gorilla/2008/01/16/rangers-
badly-beaten-during-anti-charcoal-patrols/)

In South Africa, there have been power shortages and reports of cable cars in
ski resorts being stuck. The blogger/cartoonist _Jeremy Nell_ [hilariously
illustrates](http://trashmedia.co.za/2008/01/23/23-jan-2008/) the situation,
and [the blog _The ACDP Insider_ wonders who is to blame for the power
shortages](http://acdpinsider.blogspot.com/2008/01/power-shortages-whos-to-
blame.html); saying:

> Power shortages are indeed a hot topic in South Africa. I think most of us
> are somewhat at a loss for words on the matter. There's an unspoken question
> of: how can we be short of something so basic and so intrinsic to our lives?
> Electricity is so ingrained into our way of living that it comes as
> something of a shock to the system when you stumble cluelessly around the
> house at night wondering what to do with yourself.

While on the topic of energy and blackouts in South Africa, _Ray Hartley_ of
the blog _Thought Leader_ writes that it would be an opportune moment for
proponents of nuclear energy to make their case:

> As the entire country experiences waves of “load-shedding”, the public is
> less choosy than ever about where the electricity comes from, so long as the
> stove stays on while supper is being cooked.  
>  There is a danger that this climate could lead to the uncritical adoption
> of Eskom’s planned nuclear generators.  
>  Communities need to be vigilant about where these facilities will be
> located and how waste will be disposed of once they are active.  
>  Beggars can still be choosers.

_Ian Gilfillan_ of _Neverness_ [looks at the alternatives to nuclear
power](http://www.greenman.co.za/b2evolution/blogs/index.php?title=the_nuclear_tooth_fairy&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1),
stating…

> Besides all of its other problems, nuclear power has a long lead-time.
> Waiting for nuclear power to save us is like waiting for the tooth fairy. We
> need to do something before that. Reducing demand by rolling out solar
> powered traffic lights, and solar-powered water heaters, is a good start,
> and the only unfortunate thing is that it takes a crisis to implement
> something so obviously sensible.

Also from South Africa, the blog
[_Greencars_](http://www.planetthoughts.org/?pg=pt/Whole&qid=1764) announces a
fun competition from
[_PlanetThoughts_](http://www.planetthoughts.org/?pg=pt/Whole&qid=1764); a
$500 Eco-car photo contest that is confirmed to be open to South Africans.
More information on how it works is available on the[ blog
post](http://www.greencars.za.net/500-eco-car-photo-contest/).

We end this roundup with a picture from DRC of a baby Gorilla, courtesy of the
