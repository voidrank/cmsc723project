Bloggers in the UAE are worried that [_YouTube_](http://www.youtube.com/) may
be banned in the Emirates, after access to photography hosting site
_[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)_ has been totally blocked.

According to Press
[reports](http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2009/March/theuae_March239.xml&section=theuae),
_YouTube_ is ranked among the top 10 most popular sites in the UAE and news
about its possible censorship has sparked debate in the blogosphere.

[_Fake Plastic Souks_](http://fakeplasticsouks.blogspot.com/2009/03/youtube-
ban-on-anvil.html) sounds the alarm, and writes:

> Blocking YouTube will further deny Emirati, and other, youth here of the
> opportunity to embrace a range of technologies and changes in social
> behaviour that are revolutionising the world around us.
>
> That we are even contemplating blocking sites that contain content we don't
> like is a deep concern – the trick is engaging in a conversation, taking
> part in the interplay of ideas and opinion that is driving the Internet –
> and the flow of public  
>  opinion around the world today.

[_the grapeshisha blog_](http://blog.grapeshisha.com/2009/03/youtube-to-be-
banned-in-uae.html) wonders:

> We heard these rumors in the past, but more and more people seem to be
> confirming that these aren’t just false alarms anymore and that YouTube will
> actually be banned officially in the UAE. We can’t be totally sure yet until
> the site is totally inaccessible for our friends and members there, and
> according to them no action has been taken yet (despite thousands of other
> sites being blocked) however many are expecting it. Will the ban fail like
> it did with Facebook? Is the UAE testing the waters with how much internet
> censorship it can get away with?

Local newspaper _[Khaleej Times](http://www.ameinfo.com/148022.html)_ reports
that the UAE's Telecommunication Regulatory Authority has said that YouTube
will not be completely banned in the country as its content is already
regulated by the authority.

_[Dubai Jazz](http://dubai-jazz.blogspot.com/2009/03/youtube-ban.html)_ agrees
that some of _YouTube_ ‘s content should be moderated. He notes:

> There comes the inevitable question, is youtube totally ‘safe’? Of course
> not, and I wholeheartedly support censorship on some of its content.
> Especially the kind of hate inciting content. You might choose to believe
> otherwise, but WE DO NOT have democracy and total freedom of expression in
> the Arab World. We have a vicious Sunni-Shia sectarian strife. We have an
> intimidating rate of illiteracy. We have an intimidating rate of credulity.
> The stable and relatively prosperous Arab societies are stable because there
> are measures that ENSURE everything stays stable. Even when stability
> sometimes borders on stagnation….. in short, I am not worried about moral
> disintegration of societies, I am worried about strives and rifts. So for
> the time being, some of the content, in my opinion, may have to be censored.

Meanwhile, [_MMM_](http://www.subzeroblue.com/archives/2009/03/flickr-now-
totally-blocked-in-the-uae.html) reports that _Flickr_ is now totally blocked
in the UAE, after it was blocked by one Internet provider.

> Today, [_Du_](http://www.du.ae/) followed the lead of
> _[Etisalat](http://www.answers.com/Etisalat)_ and went ahead and blocked the
> photo sharing service Flickr, meaning that Flickr is now no longer
> accessible from the UAE through any of the ISPs.  
>  I’m guessing it’s because of all the x-rated material that is available on
> Flickr. But, it’s not like blocking Flickr is going to stop people who look
> for that kind of material from finding it.  
>  This totally sucks! All my photos are hosted on Flickr where I have a pro
> account, and now I’m unable to access my photos or upload any new ones
> because of this.

_MMM_ also posts a photograph of the ban order:
