It hasn't been easy to try and stop child labor in Nicaragua, and the
following videos provide a look into the reasons why many children are still
working despite the new laws. While some families are seeing value in getting
their children educated and are responding to awareness campaigns, for others
child labor is the way they keep their families afloat. While the law
establishes that government, employers, syndicates and families all have the
obligation to prevent child labor that could harm a child physically or
emotionally and which keeps them from studying or developing, the hard
economical situation in Nicaragua makes it very hard for families to resist
either sending their children out to work or assigning domestic work for them
to do at home.

Journeyman pictures cover this in [Hard
Labour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkAnvHnqJVw "Journeyman pictures hard
labour video"), where it shows children doing dangerous work, while
authorities either deny their existence or declare themselves unable to turn a
child away when they know the income is needed by their families:

> A group of children smash stones into small pieces, risking blindness as

However, some changes have been made, particularly in the coffee industry.
Farmers who wish for their coffee to be part of Fair Trade, need to guarantee
the children in the farms are not picking coffee but instead going to school.
The coffee-pickers were child laborers themselves, and while they are aware of
the challenges for them to send their kids to school instead of having them
adding income, one of the woman also mentions that it is a sacrifice that
needs to be made in order to successfully raise her children. However, getting
a child back into school is not easy, as shown by the story of Fabiola and her
son Jose, where even though she has wanted to enroll her child in school
instead of having him working in the streets, she has faced obstacles all
along the way, and even if Jose enrolls, he'll probably have to deal with the
stigma of being a child worker.

Children pitch in with their opinions on child labor in Nicaragua in the next
two videos. Through video training by Xchange Perspectives, children in the
Jinotega region of Nicaragua [reported on the
issue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dDlz9F1f1c "Child Labor in Jinotega
Nicaragua"):

And from[ Abre Tus Ojos Nicaragua](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFHOPN09Uw
"Abre tus Ojos Nicaragua") [es], teens also reported on the issue in
Matagalpa, to the North of Nicaragua. Through interviews with child workers as
well as authorities in organizations trying to prevent child labor, the
reasons behind these kids working are much of the same. For example, sometimes
their family group is only the child and the mother, so the extra income is
needed to make ends meet, or through sickness, these children become the only
ones able to bring in income to feed their family and have to become adults
overnight. Other times, parents have their children working so they learn
about working and not lazying about doing nothing. Although they work all day
and go home very tired, these children and teens take pride in the help they
give their families, not considering it as “work” or something that denies
them their rights. Actions being taken are combining education in the morning
and then allowing for the children to go and help their families while raising
awareness among the children and teens so they are aware of their rights.
