When non-governmental activists visited an elementary school in [Šariské
Michaľany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Šarišské_Michaľany), north-eastern
Slovakia, they found that most of the Romani children were separated in
“special” classes. They filed a lawsuit, in which the school was accused of
segregating students based on their ethnic origin. The school lost, despite
arguments that the children were not divided due to their skin color, but in
accordance with their capabilities, to help the ones with poorer results by
using individual approach. In reaction, some parents of the children who were
doing better decided to move them to a school in a nearby city.

[A study](http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/12/roma-
education-uk) conducted among the UK-based children of the Roma migrants from
Central and Eastern Europe found that in the new environment children could
achieve good results and there was no reason to place them in special classes.

In fact, the idea of “a new environment” has also been considered in Slovakia.
However, the proposal of moving children out of their parents’ homes to
campuses was rejected as inhuman and is also not supported by parents who are
afraid to lose their childcare-related social benefits.

These days, there is much discussion in Slovakia of the [open
letter](http://janmacek.blog.sme.sk/c/301577/Otvoreny-list-uciteliek-z-
vychodneho-Slovenska.html) [sk] to the minister of education, written by two
ordinary elementary school teachers from
[Dobšiná](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dob%C5%A1in%C3%A1) (or, as they
formulate it, from the “Far East” – as opposed to the capital city of
[Bratislava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava), located in western
Slovakia).

Below is a short excerpt from this letter:

> Dear Mr. Minister,
>
> […] Our letter is just a reaction to the intolerable situation in the Slovak
> education and the country's dysfunctional, unjust social system. We believe
> and hope that it will serve as an impulse to review the current situation
> and position of teachers.
>
> In Bratislava, far from your favorite “marginalized and socially
> disadvantaged groups,” you have no idea what stalemate we are forced to
> fight every day. Come for a few days to live with the issues we are dealing
> with every day. Let's look into our schools, finally meet with the real
> students and let's sit in the classroom for a few lessons. Instead of empty
> talk detached from reality, you should get to know the real situation. […]
>
> The greatest difficulties we have with students who are significantly
> maladjusted socially, they are almost exclusively students of the Romani
> origin. However, we want to emphasize that this is not about race, skin or
> the prejudices and reservations against the Roma.
>
> Truants, whose numbers of unexcused absences are abnormally high, are the
> first problem in our school. Because the relevant authorities and
> institutions hardly ever penalize students or their guardians, students
> continue to be absent with impunity and, what's worse, give negative example
> to other classmates […].
>
> In addition to this, these students are usually aggressive, arrogant, and
> there are various types of sexual harassment going on not only towards
> fellow students, but also towards female teachers. […]
>
> Almost all parents are avoiding solving the problems and do not show even
> the minimal willingness to cooperate with the school. […]
>
> The parents of these children receive financial contributions of €17, paid
> mostly to a group of maladjusted citizens just for having their children
> complete basic schooling. […]
>
> School supplies, ordered by the school for these children, are absolutely
> not valued by the students and are destroyed, broken, torn or monetized in
> just a couple days. […] Children wear torn, dirty, stinky pieces of
> clothing, broken shoes, come to school without snacks, have lice and various
> kinds of skin diseases, and lack the most basic ideas about hygiene! But
> they always find money for mobile phones, alcohol and cigarettes. […]
>
> The vast majority of children are not trained at all, they have never
> attended a kindergarten and some do not know the Slovak language at all,
> they have never picked up a pencil and never drawn, they are unfamiliar with
> toys, colors, and during the first weeks of their stay with us they are not
> being taught the first letters, numbers and colors, but are getting
> familiarized with running water, flushing the toilets […].
>
> Communication with these children is very hard, they understand speech
> poorly, do not understand what is required, because of their limited
> vocabulary (and not only in Slovak, but also in the Romani language). […]
>
> We cannot provide them with equal access to education when they do not start
> at the same “starting point.” […] As a result of the artificial efforts of
> integration, the clever minority […] drops to the level of the clumsy and
> integrates with them. […] Deferment of compulsory schooling in these cases
> resolves absolutely nothing; on the contrary, the child will lose a whole
> year (because the family will not care about him again). […]
>
> Therefore, do not be surprised that parents of brighter children prefer to
> enroll their children in schools outside their place of residence […].
>
> Maladjusted fellow citizens quickly become accustomed to the benefits that
> are offered to them by the state and get used to the idea that everything
> will be free […]. It's a vicious circle: They are poor because they have no
> jobs – they have no jobs because they are uneducated – they are uneducated,
> because they are not interested in education. […]
>
> The number of pregnant schoolgirls in the lower grades grows not only in our
> schools. […] Again, the result of the poorly adjusted social system and the
> conscious ignoring of the problem is that the young student girls do not see
> any problem with their pregnancies – on the contrary, they perceive it as a
> welcome way of earning money. […] The situation is alarming! […] The
> officials, instead of imposing penalties, paradoxically even give them
> advice on what to do to get extra money […].
>
> We have a huge amount of obligations, orders and restrictions for teachers,
> but any possibility of self-defense or the power to intervene have been
> taken away. We must do everything, but we can do nothing… […]
>
> Is there anyone who will stand up for us teachers? […] When the teacher's
> imaginary cup of patience overflows and he raises his voice at the student,
> he is immediately accused of causing the child mental anguish. […]
>
> We love our work, we've chosen the teaching profession in the belief that we
> will create a “better world” – but under these circumstances it is not
> possible. […]
>
> Erika Polgáriová and Eleonóra Liptáková

Below are some comments from the discussion on the blog that published the
teachers’ letter.

pegasus76 (in reply):

Lianka:

> working, […] no one will employ them, they have no chance for a normal life

daduli:
