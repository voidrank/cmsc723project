In 2009, artists from around the world supported the Green Movement in Iran
with their artwork, as protesters defied the Islamic regime over the
presidential election results. Three years later
[United4Iran](http://www.united4iran.org/2012/06/azadi), a non profit
organization campaigning for human rights in Iran, steps in with an online
music compilation designed to revive hope for freedom for Iranians.

Firouzeh Mahmoudi, founder of United4Iran says to Global Voices:

> We chose songs for the album “Azadi: Songs of Freedom for Iran” that had the
> right message – that spoke to the struggle for human rights and democracy in
> Iran and around the world. We operate from the perspective that struggles
> for human rights, democracy and freedom are global issues, and our best
> opportunity for success is solidarity. In that spirit, we also sought non-
> Iranian artists, which ended up including countries like Egypt, Palestine,
> Iraq, South Africa, the United States, etc

You can listen to all the songs [here](http://azadimusic.bandcamp.com/).

Firouzeh says:

> Music speaks to the heart, and it is most often through emotion that people
> are moved to action… within the first 36 hours of the release on June 12, we
> had had more than 8,000 visitors to
> [azadimusic.bandcamp.com](http://azadimusic.bandcamp.com) and more than
> 9,400 total listens of the songs.
