Voting is underway today in the tiny West African nation of The Gambia, where
incumbent president Yahya Jammeh is seeking a fifth term. On the eve of
elections, which were preceded by a fierce campaign, authorities have shut
down the internet and other essential telecommunications. Independent
candidate Adama Barrow, backed by a coalition of at least seven political
parties, along with Mamma Kandeh of the newly formed [Gambia Democratic
Congress](https://www.facebook.com/Gambia-Democratic-
Congress-1731138147164567/) (GDC), are challenging Jammeh in what analysts say
is the most crucial vote in more than two decades.

According to the electoral [commission](http://iec.gm/), in a country which
has a population of about two million, up to 886,578 are registered voters.
Polls opened at 7:00 am and will close at 5:00 pm (1700 hrs GMT).

about the shutdown:

The shutdown started on the evening of Wednesday November 30, 2016, barely
hours after a coalition of non-governmental organisations, led by [Access
Now](https://www.accessnow.org/), issued a letter calling on Gambian
authorities not to block internet access.

“We implore you to keep the internet on,” the letter
[noted](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-joint-letter-internet-election-
gambia/), adding that internet has enabled significant advances in health,
education and creativity, and is now essential to fully realise human rights —
including participation in elections and access to information.

Fatu Camara, a Gambian journalist and former press secretary of president
Jammeh, who now hosts the country's most popular television show, tweeted
about the shutdown:

> Total information black out in
> [#Gambia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gambia?src=hash), no phone calls going
> through, no internet access Help us spread the word, dictators can't be

In the 2015 “Freedom on the Net” report, [Freedom
House](https://freedomhouse.org/about-us), a US-based organisation promoting
freedom and democracy around the world, scored up to 65 countries on the real-
world rights and freedoms enjoyed by their citizens. The Gambia was ranked the
[second worst](https://globalvoices.org/2015/11/09/on-net-freedom-report-in-
africa-the-gambia-scores-poorly/) out of 12 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Jammeh has said that any post-election protests will not be tolerated. He
maintains that his leadership has improved the country, and says that the
majority of tertiary-level students in The Gambia attend university on
[government scholarships](http://observer.gm/vp-govt-awarded-
over-400-scholarship-packages/).

Vote counting is conducted at the polling stations, where all candidates can
be represented by at least two agents. Election results will start to trickle
in by late this evening, but final counts are expected on Friday December 2,
2016.

_**Update 29 November 2016:**_ In the end, ECOWAS will not observe the
elections in The Gambia. According to local sources, the chairman of the
electoral commission said the regional groups application for observation was
not received on time.
