Lee Chapman is a street photographer who prolifically documents life in Tokyo.
While Chapman, a professional photographer who shoots for the Guardian, the
Economist, the Daily Mail and other publications, maintains a
[portfolio](https://leechapman.photos), his blog [Tokyo
Times](http://wordpress.tokyotimes.org/) is updated three times a week.

Chapman has lived in Japan since 1998. He originally intended to stay for a
year or two, but now he says Japan is his home. According to [a recent
interview available
online](https://www.martinbaileyphotography.com/2017/04/17/artist-feature-lee-
chapman-of-tokyo-times-podcast-569/), Chapman says using a [Leica M8
Rangefinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M8) — the relatively small
camera allows him to approach his subjects — has influenced his work.

While Chapman documents life in and around Tokyo, recent blog posts have also
captures _haikyo_ , a genre of photography that documents the slow decline of
abandoned buildings in Japan and elsewhere.

There is something for almost every interest on Chapman's blog, include more
formal portraits:

At its best, Chapman's blog captures scenes of everyday life in Japan, some of
which may not be around for much longer:

Since Chapman is so prolific, it can be challenging to figure out how to start
exploring his images. Luckily, Chapman has listed his “[favourite images of
2016](http://wordpress.tokyotimes.org/a-few-favourite-photographs-
from-2016/)“, which provide a good introduction to his street photography.

If you're interested in some of the more technical details of how Chapman
approaches photography, there is an excellent interview with yet another
Japan-based photographer, [nature and wildlife photographer Martin
Bailey](https://www.martinbaileyphotography.com/about/).
