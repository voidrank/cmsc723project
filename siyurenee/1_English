Syria's story is one that has been weaved through families from one millennium
to the next. Subjugated as a Roman province under the command of [Pompey the
Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pompey-the-Great) in 64 BC, and
brought under Ottoman rule 16 centuries later by [Sultan Selim
I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Selim-I) in 1516, the country has
experienced its share of the world's great military conquests. The empires
that vied to establish dominance over the region left behind varied
architectural and cultural legacies that were subsumed into the nation's
heritage. For Syrians, the experience of savoring the spices at the [Souqs in
Aleppo ](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/05/aleppo-souk-syria-
destroyed-war)or admiring the gem that is the [Roman theatre in
Bosra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Theatre_at_Bosra) are birthrights.

Syria's historic sites have long attested to its riveting history. But their
pulverization over the course of a six-year civil war that has claimed well
over [400,000](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/staffan-de-
mistura-400000-killed-syria-civil-war-160423055735629.html) lives and
displaced more than half the country's population means future Syrians, and
the world at large, risk being deprived of this long-standing narrative.

### **Aleppo Souqs**

The Ancient City of Aleppo, inscribed on
[UNESCO](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/21)‘s World Heritage Site list in 1986,
has historically served as a vibrant trading centre where commercial roads
from East and West met, located strategically between the Mediterranean Sea
and Mesopotamia. Its prominence in history is attributed to its location at
one end of [the Silk Road](http://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/aleppo).

One of the world’s oldest continually inhabited cities, it has experienced
some of the most horrid atrocities of the war.

[Towards the fall](https://globalvoices.org/2016/11/30/the-end-is-near-
remember-what-we-sacrificed-dispatches-from-eastern-aleppo/) of the then-
besieged Eastern part of the city in December at the hands of the Assad regime
and its proxies, local activists expressed their struggle to count daily
[death tolls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/01/in-
syrias-aleppo-theres-no-way-of-counting-the-dead/?utm_term=.708ffa00f48e).

According to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research
([UNITAR](http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat/unitar/downloads/chs/FINAL_Syria_WHS.pdf)),
a total of 22 heritage locations in the city were destroyed and 48 severely
damaged as of 2013.

In the busy bustle of Al-Madina Souq, one would typically find a colourful
array of imported goods, ranging from silk to spices, and local goods
including soap and wool. Apart from trading, the souq also was home to Khans
(caravanserais), which accommodated traders along with their goods.

In late 2012, intense fighting took place between the regime and the Free
Syrian Army (FSA) in and around the Souq. The regime[
attacked](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9652009/Death-
of-monument-to-human-history-in-Syrias-war-torn-Aleppo.html) the historic site
using mortars, leaving it ablaze.

While UNITAR’s assessment of the damages found that most of the shops have
been completely destroyed, one hopeful Aleppine [expressed to The
Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9652009/Death-
of-monument-to-human-history-in-Syrias-war-torn-Aleppo.html) newspaper in
2012:

### **The Citadel of Aleppo**

The Citadel of Aleppo is a fortified medieval castle located in the heart of
the old city and considered to be one of the world’s largest and oldest of its
kind. The limestone monument had fallen under the control of Byzantines,
Greeks, Ayyubids, Ottomans, and others, and each of its various conquerors
left their own mark on it architecturally.

The citadel was [shelled continually](http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-
East/2012/Aug-11/184198-aleppo-citadel-hit-by-shelling-says-

explosion](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33499609) in July 2015
caused part of its walls to collapse.

The Syrian regime and rebel groups exchanged blame for the explosion.

Several photographs published by a photographer of Syrian TV in Aleppo show
sniper positions inside the Aleppo citadel, which has become a military camp
of the Assad regime's army. This positioning of snipers puts the monument in
danger from rebel fire. The photographs reveal that one of the citadel's
towers is damaged and has cracks. Several facades and architectural components
of the citadel such as towers have sustained damage. [Source:

### **The** **Great Mosque of Aleppo (Umayyad Mosque)**

The 15th-century Aleppine historian [Ibn al-
Shihna](http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/great-mosque-aleppo#_edn8)
wrote: “The Great Mosque of Aleppo rivaled that of Damascus in its decoration,
painting, and mosaic.”

The Great Mosque of Aleppo, otherwise known as the Umayyad Mosque, had its
spectacular minaret built in 1090 and which lasted nearly 1,000 years — it was
destroyed in 2013.

The Umayyad mosque shares many characteristics with its sister mosque in
Damascus, ranging from the marble courtyard to the location on a
Roman/Byzantine site.

The Syrian regime, backed by its Russian and Iranian allies, persistently
targeted the mosque in the battle for control of the city that raged following
its capture by rebel forces in 2012.

One witness, a rebel fighter, recalled:

> [[The army](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/24/minaret-historic-
> syrian-mosque-destroyed-aleppo)] then tried to storm the mosque but we
> pushed them back.

According to UNITAR’s assessment, the mosque has sustained severe damage to
its eastern outer wall, the southern part of the eastern gallery, the marble-
tiled courtyard, the garden, and the entrance to the souq from the eastern
gallery.

way/2013/04/24/178906558/minaret-of-iconic-syrian-mosque-destroyed-in-

told The Associated Press:

> This is like blowing up the Taj Mahal or destroying the Acropolis in Athens.
> This mosque is a living sanctuary. This is a disaster. In terms of heritage,
> this is the worst I've seen in Syria. I'm horrified.

### **Alomari Mosque, Daraa**

Deemed a symbol of the revolution, the Daraa mosque was built in the 7th
century by the Islamic Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab. Its once marvelous minaret,
now destroyed, was the first minaret in all of the Levant.

The historic mosque had been the focus of [anti-
regime](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/04/14/Historic-
mosque-in-Daraa-destroyed-in-Syrian-army-shelling-.html) demonstrations in
Daraa and hosted a great number of protests that were consistently met with
brutality from government security forces.

It was primarily for this reason that the regime persistently shelled the
mosque, destroying its minaret, in an attempt to crush the spirits of
protestors.

In June, Syrian regime helicopters dropped four[ barrel
bombs](http://sn4hr.org/blog/2017/06/17/syrian-regime-forces-shelled-al-omari-
mosque-daraa-al-balad-daraa-city-june-9/) loaded with incendiary substances on
the mosque, burning its northern section.

### **Bosra**

In the vicinity of this historically rich southern city lies a grandiose 2nd-
century Roman theatre, some of the oldest surviving Islamic mosques and
Christian ruins, too. The Ancient City of Bosra, inscribed as a UNESCO World
Heritage Site in 1980 and added to UNESCO’s list of [World Heritage in
Danger](http://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/) in 2013, was once the capital of the
Roman province of Arabia and a stop-over for caravans en route to Mecca.

Crac des Chevaliers, meaning ‘Castle of the Knights’, is a Crusader castle in
the Homs Province of Syria. Another UNESCO World Heritage site, it is regarded
as one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The
fortified castle was built by the Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem
from 1142 to 1271 and received further construction by the Mamluks in the late
[13th century](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1229).

The castle has endured significant damage, especially to the Crusader chapel,
due to a series of shellings and [airstrikes](http://www.middle-east-
online.com/english/?id=60073) by the Syrian regime.

### **Palmyra**

The ancient semitic city of Palmyra grew wealthy during the Roman Empire on
account of its prominent merchants that operated along the Silk Road. This
wealth facilitated the construction of exquisite monuments that include the
Temple of Bel, Tower of Elahbel, and the Arch of Triumph. Unfortunately, all
three of these monuments have endured severe damage and even destruction.

Since capturing the city in 2015,
[ISIS](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/isis-destruction-of-
palmyra-syria-heart-been-ripped-out-of-the-city) has blown up a great number
of its temples and other monuments.

Once a city that captured the heart of every historian and archeologist,
Palmyra now evokes a sense of mourning for a rich heritage cast aside.

### **Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque**

The Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque in Homs is named after the Muslim Arab military
commander who led the 7th century Muslim conquest of Syria that ended
Byzantine rule in the country. Consecrated in 1908, the mosque is notable for
its traditional Ottoman-Turkish architectural style.

In 2013, Assad’s forces shelled the historic mosque, ultimately destroying its
[mausoleum](http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=60268). The mosque
has witnessed regular attacks ever since.
