[fr] a brief introduction to the Tuareg culture : “we are a nomadic people
living from farming and trade. The Tuaregs are estimated to be about 1.5
million in a region that spans across Mali, Niger, Algeria, but also Libya,
Burkina Faso and Mauritania. The common language Tamashek is related to the
Berber language. With the Ethiopian population, the Tuaregs are one of the few
African people with their own calligraphy. The distinguishing features of the
Tuareg clothing are the indigo veil they wear hence their nickname “the men in
blue”.
