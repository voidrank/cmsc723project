Ethiopia's candidate for Director-General of World Health Organization (WHO),
[Tedros Adhanom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom), shocked many
observers when he displayed a complete lack of knowledge about global health
strategies during a candidates’
[forum](http://www.who.int/dg/election/candidates-forum/en/) on November 2,
2016. Though Adhanom has served in the Ethiopian government as both minister
of health and foreign affairs, he failed to answer a basic question about his
claims that he is running a campaign on a framework that promotes the health
needs of the developing world.

“Sorry, the question is not clear, can you clarify?” he answered, when a
representative from Brazil asked him to explain why he claims to represent the
developing world, when the agenda he advocated in his presentation espoused
the health agenda of the developed world. Instead of answering the question,
Adhanom tried to engage in a conversation with the Brazilian representative,
apparently hoping to grasp what the question meant.
[Awkwardly](http://ecadforum.com/2016/11/05/tedros-adhanoms-embarrassing-
moments-as-who-candidate/), the moderator intervened, trying to help Adhanom
understand the question.

Adhanom also stumbled with another question at the same forum, when asked
about the technical cooperation of WHO member states:

> The gentleman from Brazil might have ended

> [@WHO](https://twitter.com/WHO) Director-General by asking a simple

This embarrassing performance could hurt Adhanom’s current political campaign
for the post of head of the global health body. Recently, he was relieved of
his ministerial duties in the Ethiopian government, following a [cabinet
reshuffle.](http://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-cabinet-reshuffle-state-of-
emergency/3574532.html) During his presentation last week, Adhanom said the
Ethiopian government replaced him with a new foreign minister, so he could
focus on the campaign.

Though he's [endorsed](http://www.au.int/en/pressreleases/30743/au-backs-
ethiopias-foreign-minister-who-director-general) by African Union, Adhanom has
been under continuous assault from prominent members of Ethiopian civil
society and opposition [groups,](http://ecadforum.com/2016/04/19/ethiopian-
opposed-the-candidacy-of-tedros-adhanom/) who argue that his ties with the
Ethiopian regime should disqualify him from leading WHO. These groups have
also started an [online petition](https://www.change.org/p/we-oppose-tedros-
adhanom-s-candidacy-for-director-general-of-
who?recruiter=13662086&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive).

When Adhanom launched his campaign in April 2016, Ethiopia was beset by [anti-
government protests](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/ethiopian-
protesters-endure-brutality-and-censorship-amid-land-struggle/). Citing the
government's violent actions against protesters, 20 Ethiopian political and
civic organizations signed a
[letter](http://ecadforum.com/2016/04/19/ethiopian-opposed-the-candidacy-of-
tedros-adhanom/) declaring Adhanom unfit to lead the World Health
Organization, saying he is the face of the regime.

[The letter read](http://ecadforum.com/2016/04/19/ethiopian-opposed-the-
candidacy-of-tedros-adhanom/): “Mr. Adhanom did not lend confidence as a
public health figure while he served as the Minister of Health in Ethiopia.
[…] His tenure as head of the Federal Ministry of Health was fraught with
mismanagement and incompetence.”

The letter refers to an audit conducted by the Office of the Inspector
General, which was prompted by reports of “mismanagement of money and
incompetence.” Subsequent research available on the Internet confirmed that
the audit uncovered detailed evidence of [financial
mismanagement](https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41304017.pdf).

In a separate letter, one activist [outlined](http://www.ayyaantuu.net/letter-
to-the-editor-why-dr-tedros-adhanom-should-not-lead-the-world-health-
organization/) his reasons why Mr. Adhanom should not be allowed anywhere near
the World Health Organization.

The human rights website “Al Mariam” also offers a strong
[denunciation](http://almariam.com/2016/06/05/ethiopia-guess-who-is-coming-to-
who-in-2017/) of Adhanom's WHO candidacy:

> Adhanom’s shallowness and cluelessness in matters of foreign policy and
> diplomacy are simply incredible.
>
> His public speeches and statements generally lack not only substance and
> coherence, but are simply nonsensical. In July 2015, Adhanom
> [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz1yBgiupwQ) Ethiopia is a democracy
> with one hundred percent of the vote! (Of course, so did Obama. Two
> “nonsenses” don’t make one bit of sense!)
>
> Adhanom’s diplomatic
> [speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWDU2fWHfjI#t=58) are chock full
> of platitudes, clichés, buzzwords and hokum. He has a distinct proclivity to
> frame complex issues in worn out and left over phrases from the days of
> student activism of his late boss, thugmaster Meles Zenawi.
>
> Adhanom manifests little understanding of international diplomacy and
> appears to lack even an elementary understanding of international law,
> treaties and conventions. ****

Meanwhile, Adhanom has been making the case that he would bring a fresh
perspective to the WHO's leadership. Other than the African Union, some pro-
government diaspora [groups](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/samuel-
getachew/tedros-adhanom-who_b_11603074.html) and international
[figures](https://hafsamohamed1.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/3-reasons-why-dr-
tedros-adhanom-should-be-the-next-who-director-general/) have also backed his
candidacy.

Adhanom has relied heavily on social media to build his “brand” in Ethiopia —
a country where access to social media is highly limited. Access isn't so
restricted, however, that Adhanom's gaffes at the Nov. 2 forum haven't led to
mockery online, where critics have enjoyed making fun of his surprising
ignorance.

On Twitter, the hashtag
[#NoTedros4WHO](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoTedros4WHO?src=hash) gained
popularity, with many users arguing that Adhanom has disqualified himself from
holding any position at the WHO.
