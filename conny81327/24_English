Many Australians agreed with [Greens](http://greens.org.au/) party leader
Richard Di Natale recently when he called for an [end to the war on
drugs.](http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/national/greens-leader-
richard-di-natale-on-why-drugs-should-be-decriminalised/news-
story/fec912366f78810f4d4c9735c72e4281) The Greens is a minority party that
[supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens) conservation,
responsible environmental management such as climate change action, and social
justice. It also advocates a more independent foreign policy for Australia.

The country's politicians, policy makers and health professionals have been
arguing for years over recreational drug strategies — ‘Just say no’ versus
‘harm minimisation’, and tough law enforcement versus decriminalisation are
well trodden warpaths.

Of course, members of the general public have more than a passing interest, as
the new [Greens policy](http://greens.org.au/policies/drugs-substance-abuse-
addiction) calls for decriminalisation, including support for drug testing
kits at music festivals. These kits allow festival-goers to test substances
they have bought to see what they contain. A private trial this summer by the
[#JustOneLife](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23justonelife%20near%3A%22Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales%22%20within%3A1500mi&src=typd)
campaign which is advocating for these legal testing kits has been very
[controversial](http://mixmag.net/read/free-pill-testing-kits-to-be-handed-
out-at-sydney-festivals-news).

Many from the health community [tweeted their
thoughts](https://twitter.com/simbris/status/803561263104040961), while others
have used proposals such as Thailand's [latest
move](https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/status/803579853802848256) to
[decriminalise meth](http://theweek.com/articles/648585/why-thailand-moving-
closer-decriminalizing-meth) [methamphetamine] as evidence of a growing
international trend:

The Australian Medical Association, according to its president, Dr Michael
Gannon, rejects decriminalisation of illicit drugs including cannabis, but
would like to see more done:

> 2016](https://twitter.com/amapresident/status/803228656143245312)

The Age, one of Australia's key daily newspapers, supports the move,
[arguing](http://www.theage.com.au/comment/the-age-editorial/the-war-on-drugs-
has-failed-and-australia-must-change-its-policies-20161129-gszwmj.html) that
the war on drugs “should be dumped in favour of a harm minimisation strategy
based on decriminalisation, regulation and education”. It added, “We continue
to so advocate, and believe the resources being wasted on this misguided,
indefensible ‘war’ should be diverted from the criminal justice system to the
health system, where there is a need for more treatment facilities and support
to help those with drug issues recover and stay well.”

Many tweets linked to their editorial. Twitter user and drug law reform doctor
Alex Wodak was clearly frustrated by the political inaction:

[Harm Reduction Australia](https://twitter.com/harmreductionau) released an
online [statement](http://www.harmreductionaustralia.org.au/wp-
content/uploads/2016/11/HRA-Statement-of-Drug-Policy-Hysteria.pdf) on what it
calls ‘drug hysteria':

> There has been an ill-informed, and at times bizarre, response to the
> Greens’  
>  announcement that their blanket opposition to legalising any drugs will be
> replaced with a more evidence-informed and regulatory approach to drugs.
>
> …The lifelong consequences of arresting, charging and in some cases
> imprisoning tens of thousands of people every year are costly,
> counterproductive and harmful.
>
> We are also experiencing a level of drug related overdose deaths that is
> once again escalating at alarming rates.

There were few online responses criticising the Greens’ proposal. Perhaps it
was a case of the silent majority. [Shooglebunny's
comments](https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88712343) on a
Guardian opinion piece may well represent their views:

> Yes its always time for a ‘grown up conversation’ that of course must
> conclude that legalisation of drugs will be the best thing since sliced
> bread.
>
> Its essential that the middle classes can access weed and the lighter drugs
> easily, with no possibility of being criminalised and that some sort of
> quality control is imposed.
>
> That way they can puff, snort and swallow to their hearts content. Never
> mind any negative social consequences for other less privileged people; they
> don't count anyway.

It may all be in vain for the time being, as the major parties have shown
little interest in discussing the Greens’ policy. The Federal health minister,
Sussan Ley, [swiftly rejected](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-
politics/political-news/just-say-no-australian-medical-association-rejects-
greens-new-drug-legalisation-push-20161127-gsyh5c.html) the Greens’ calls for
change”. The opposition Labor Party do not currently endorse
decriminalisation, [arguing instead
for](http://www.100positivepolicies.org.au/a_new_national_drug_strategy) more
treatment options and strengthening of harm minimisation strategies.

The Greens have nine senators and one member of the House of Representatives
in the Federal Parliament. Since the government does not have a majority in
the Senate, they should be able to keep the issue on the national agenda.
