Following the harrowing rape and murder of 7-year-old [Zainab

city located south of Lahore (the provincial capital of Punjab), celebrities
began using the [#MeToo](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/pakistan-
long-metoo-moment-180422151525450.html) hashtag to talk about sexual assault
faced by women in Pakistan.

Theatre and TV actor [Nadia

took to Twitter to open up about their own childhood sexual abuse stories,
encouraging others to come forward with theirs. Unfortunately, cases like
Zainab’s are some of the only times when people can come forward with their
own stories and help to shed light on deep-rooted issues.

However, a recent case involving sexual assault accusations against a beloved
male celebrity has caused a backlash against his accuser, causing many to call
into question the double standards placed on women who speak out against
sexual violence.

Pakistan, as a country, is [no stranger](https://www.dawn.com/news/1396333) to
sexual harassment — a situation that affects all genders. According to numbers
by [Sahil](http://sahil.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cruel-Numbers-
Report-2017-1.pdf), a non-governmental organization that documents rape cases
reported in daily newspapers, in 2017, a total of 3445 child abuse cases were
reported in the newspapers in Pakistan and many of these have not been
registered with the police yet.

As people began speaking out, many saw positive effects such as the
[#JusticeForZainab](https://globalvoices.org/2018/01/13/pakistanis-demand-
justiceforzainab-7-year-old-raped-and-murdered-in-kasur/) trend which was
followed by educational videos and talk shows about good and bad touching and
the need for sex education in the country –something that was picked swiftly
by the provincial government of
[Sindh](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1609241/1-sindh-govt-introduce-awareness-
child-sexual-abuse-school-curriculum/). Many felt the country was moving
towards a positive change, that is, until April when singer and prominent
entertainment figure[ Meesha Shafi](https://images.dawn.com/news/1179890)
tweeted harassment allegations against [Ali Zafar.

is a singer and former Bollywood actor and Shafi claims that he had abused her
on multiple occasions. This time, instead of backing the accusers, the
internet and the industry seems to feel alienated; they can't seem to choose
sides.

### Is there a double standard for female Pakistani entertainers?

The Pakistani entertainment industry, which is as old as Pakistan itself
(Pakistan got independence in 1947), is judged or praised according to the
ever-changing mindset of the country’s people — something which is, in part,
inspired by heavy politicisation by the political parties and their
manifestos. Pakistan, which was heavily Islamicized and had gone into a
transition from being liberal to be conservative and back to being moderately
liberal over the years, has yet to decide if they love their entertainers or
hate them.

> 2018](https://twitter.com/aClockworkObi/status/987001646633930753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Throughout these political and social changes, what remains widely believed is
that these entertainers, or more aptly put, the women entertainers, are a bad
influence. The women who work in the industry struggle daily with maintaining
their image in the country, they are constantly under pressure to behave and
maintain a sophisticated, religious and family orientated presence. Many feel
that it is unethical for women, in general, to stay out late, mingle with more
men than necessary, to travel around the globe and stay in hotels, to be seen
on TV constantly, to wear clothes that are ‘inappropriate or to even
[smoke](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/28/mahira-khan-caught-
smoking-again/) — all of which are common practices in any entertainment
industry.

That being said the burden for social discourse also lies on these
influencers. Even though their characters are regularly questioned, their
lifestyle and ideologies matter to all these people — whether they be
detractors or not. This background is important to understand the position of
women in Pakistan, especially when they come forward with allegations of
harassment.

In Meesha Shafi’s case, what mattered to people was the fact that a beloved
male pop-star was the accused. People viewed Shafi's allegations critically,
scrutinizing her past, her behaviour, and her character. This happened to such
an extent that she decided to [deactivate her Facebook and Instagram
accounts](https://images.dawn.com/news/1179982).

In an interview with a[ local newspaper,
](https://images.dawn.com/news/1179982)Shafi states:

> They (my accounts) have been deactivated for very obvious reasons, one would
> think. The abuse, threats, bullying and slander that I have faced is the
> reason I felt the strong need to protect not just myself but my family,
> especially my two young children who were also being subjected to personal
> attacks online.

In response, some netizens questioned the veracity of Shafi's statements:

> It’s funny how such things to go one other extreme in Pakistan for starters
> we don’t even know what ali zafar did. It could have been something
> inappropriate but is it big enough to splatter it all over Twitter?

Nadia Jamil, while tweeting about the issue tried to[ present both the sides
](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/66209/dear-nadia-jamil-you-cannot-
support-meesha-shafi-and-stand-by-ali-zafar-at-the-same-time/)giving many
contradicting statements to stay on neutral ground:

This case has become a classic example of victim blaming while the perpetrator
roams freely. Unfortunately, it is not the only high profile case where we
have yet to see results in alleged harassment cases in Pakistan. Case in
point, [Ayesha Gulalai](https://globalvoices.org/2017/08/10/she-dared-to-say-
pakistans-most-popular-politician-harassed-her-then-came-the-abuse/), a member
of the national assembly of Pakistan and Imran Khan’s, leader of the
mainstream party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). In this case, Gulalai alleged
that Khan harassed her and was rebutted for her character after which she was
asked to leave the political party PTI. Her political career took a serious
blow after the incident.

On Friday, [UN Women Pakistan issued a joint statement
stating:](https://www.facebook.com/unwomenpakistan/photos/a.1023751464420679.1073741828.1016540021808490/1553333231462497/?type=3&theater)

> As the courage of #MeToo speakers across the world forces a reconsideration

The group went on to tweet:

> [#MeToo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeToo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  
>  “There must be consequences for those who choose to abuse and not to

Unfortunately, not everyone is behind Shafi. While talking to the press,
Minister of State for Interior Affairs Talal Chaudhary, called the Meesha/Ali
incident a ‘[drama](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/04/24/tallal-
chaudhry-calls-meesha-shafis-harassment-charge-against-ali-zafar-a-drama/)’,
adding that it was a scheme to “to grab media attention”.

While the [international
community](https://twitter.com/itsmeeshashafi/status/993754557468602368) and
[celebrities](https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/987804025885220870) are
paying heed to Shafi's case, the local community is still digging for evidence
to rebuke her allegations. This trend of victim shaming can be seen as an
indicator of Pakistan’s culture of silence, where people feel safer by not
disclosing these incidents due to the fear of further harassment, on social
media or in their personal circles.
