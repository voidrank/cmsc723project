Ghana is a relatively peaceful African country, especially when it comes to
election season. Politicians here have found a way to transfer power
peacefully. Ghanaians are also known for their light hand with tough socio-
political issues, finding fun in matters most others might not.

Most recently, critics of leading opposition presidential candidate Nana
Akuffo Addo ridiculed him by spreading a photo of him sipping juice from a box
of Kalyppo—a beverage popular among schoolchildren.

Twitter user Chris Vincent shared the photo online, trying to mock Addo for
his choice of drink:

The mudslinging effort would backfire, however, with Addo's supporters turning
it into a viral challenge: the
[#KalypoChallenge](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=kalypochallenge)
(spelled with one less “p” than the actual brand name), wherein Internet users
must photograph themselves with boxes of Kalyppo juice and other locally made
products.

Umaru Sanda, a journalist with the local radio station CitiFM, recently
marveled at how Addo's supporters have managed to exploit the juice-box photo:

> Always love it when people turn their “misfortune” into a great success.
> That's what the [#NPP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NPP?src=hash) has done

The online challenge is inspiring some especially creative adaptations, too.
Mainprince Essuman shared the following spin on the juice-box selfie:

The online challenge has attracted a lot of people including one of Ghana's
famous musicians, A Plus. He posted a picture of him holding the Kalyppo fruit
juice while chewing meat:

One of the most popular responses to the KalypoChallenge features a young man
performing a local gospel song using the word Kalyppo in the lyrics:

The makers of Kalyppo juice thanked Ghanaians for their support on their
Facebook page:

Some bloggers used the occasion to educate social media managers on how to
create social media campaigns like the #KalypoChallenge. In his [blog
post](http://www.jbklutse.com/social-media-marketing-lessons-from-kalypo-
challenge/), JB Klutse noted:

> Therefore as social media marketers/strategists, we must strive to find and
> support major cause behind the campaigns we run. Finding a good cause to
> support with your product will go a long way to compel your audience to
> engage with it. E.g. A cause to help small businesses with your products,
> cause to promote peace as election approaches.

Blogger Ameyaw Debrah [noted](http://ameyawdebrah.com/photos-social-media-
goes-crazy-kalypo-nana-addo-spotted-sipping-one-kalypochallenge/) how Addo's
supporters managed to flip this meme on its head:

> Kalypo fruit drink must be the hottest commodity on the market right about
> now! Ghana’s Social media landscape was swamped with photos of people
> sharing photos of their Kalypo moments after the New Patriotic Party (NPP)
> flagbearer, Nana Akufo Addo was pictured sipping his Kalypo. Even though
> many believe that the photo was initially released to mock the NPP leader,
> his followers have succeeded in pushing the argument that the former
> Attorney Generalwas promoting local products with that simple sip.

Jemila Abdulai, one Ghana's leading women bloggers, underscored the need to
promote products made in Ghana using social media:

> If all this excitement can be created around the
> [#KalypoChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KalypoChallenge?src=hash) –
> imagine what we can do with
> [#MadeInGhana](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MadeInGhana?src=hash); one item

Gavivina Okudzeto, meanwhile, warned the opposition leader to focus on
campaigning instead of the #KalypoChallenge:

> Your colleagues are campaigning day and night and you sit in Accra and do
> [#Kalypochallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kalypochallenge?src=hash).
> Will it bring votes? <https://t.co/Rz5NiYjBkN>

The buzz surrounding the #KalypoChallenge is still growing, with local
celebrities like former
