Since he was elected in
[August](https://pt.globalvoices.org/2017/08/24/resultados-provisorios-dao-
vitoria-ao-mpla-em-angola/) 2017, Angolan President João Lourenço has been
making moves which have surprised the nation. In addition to changing military
intelligence chiefs, he also
[dismissed](https://www.dn.pt/mundo/interior/isabel-dos-santos-exonerada-da-
sonangol-pelo-presidente-da-republica-de-angola-8918622.html) Isabel dos
Santos, daughter of the ex-president José Eduardo dos Santos, from the council
presidency of the national oil company Sonangol.

In December 2016, Lourenço replaced [José Eduardo dos
Santos](https://pt.globalvoices.org/2017/02/06/jose-eduardo-dos-santos-esta-
fora-da-lista-de-candidatos-do-mpla-as-eleicoes-gerais-de-angola/) as the
leader of the ruling MPLA party and assumed the country’s presidency after
obtaining a parliamentary majority in the August elections.

[José Eduardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Eduardo_dos_Santos) was
in power for over 35 years, a rule marked by human rights violations and
restrictions on free expression, with journalists and critics frequently
targeted. While now out of the presidency, José Eduardo continues to be a
leader of the MPLA and, after the last elections, he joined the Council of the
Republic, an advisory body to the president whose members enjoy legal
immunity, leading many to conclude that he continues ruling from behind the
scenes.

However, these speculations are now put in doubt in light of recent decisions
by Lourenço, who appears to be attempting to consolidate his authority over
the party.

Carlos Saturnino was nominated to replace Isabel dos Santos. Saturnino
presided over Sonangol’s council before being dismissed and replaced by Isabel
dos Santos in June 2016, on her father’s orders. As well as Isabel dos Santos,
the whole team comprising the company’s executive board was dismissed by
Lourenço.

### Is this the end of an era?

In 2013, Isabel dos Santos was identified by
[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2013/08/14/how-isabel-dos-
santos-took-the-short-route-to-become-africas-richest-woman/#5e82db4245f5)
Magazine as the richest woman in Africa, estimating her personal fortune at
around 4.5 billion US dollars. Currently, she is the biggest shareholder of
Unitel, the country’s largest cellphone operator, and of the local television
network Zap. She is also involved in NOS, a telecommunications giant in
Portugal, and has investments in international banks.

In Angola, many are commenting on what Isabel dos Santos’ dismissal means.
[Rafael
Marques](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1641755096072663/permalink/1974381752809994/),
a highly regarded local journalist and activist, thinks that her business
career is finished without Sonangol:

> A Isabel dos Santos, agora sem a Sonangol, está acabada, porque todos os
> portugueses que a apoiavam e que faziam as suas relações públicas, e
> inclusivamente a imprensa, surgiam em função do poder que ela derivava do
> seu pai. Sem isto a Isabel não vai conseguir manter os seus negócios, porque
> são negócios que foram sempre mamar do Estado e que não obedecem a critérios
> de boa gestão. São negócios que se tornaram sorvedores dos fundos públicos
> em Angola.

> Isabel dos Santos, now without Sonangol, is finished because all the
> Portuguese who supported her and conducted her public relations, including
> the press, were there due to the power that she derived from her father.
> Without this, Isabel will not be able to maintain her businesses, because
> they are businesses which were always nursed by the state and which did not
> follow standards of good governance. They are businesses which became
> dependent on Angolan public funds.

it is a genuinely historic day:

> Mais uma data inesquecível para os Angolanos, 11 de Novembro dia da
> independência, 15/de Novembro adeus a família Dos Santos. Ficará na

> Yet another unforgettable date for Angolans, 11 November the day of

the case is nothing more than plain political persecution:

> This alone is not enough, these dismissals even seem to be persecuting

without concretely enforcing accountability:

[Pedro Emanuel

distanced himself from celebrating the dismissal of Isabel dos Santos and said
that there are reasons to be proud of the former president’s daughter:

> Falaram tanto, porque fez bem de sair a Isabel, agora vão ler o trabalho que
> ela fez durante o pouco tempo como PCA da SONANGOL.  
>  Angolano às vezes ri, festeja, atira pedra, sem saber realmente o que está

> Para mim, o que me importa não é se a Isabel e filha do Ex-presidente se
> está a trabalhar deixa trabalhar, quantos entraram e desfalcar, que ninguém

> todo mundo ri.  
>  Então ela por si própria mostrou trabalho, através dos números.

> They talk so much, because it was good to make Isabel leave, now they will
> look at the work she did during her little time as PCA of SONANGOL. Angolans
> sometimes laugh, celebrate, throw stones, without really knowing what is
> happening inside.

> For me, what is important is not if Isabel, the daughter of the ex-

> while nobody opened their mouth due to being who they are. A dismissal seems
> to be a festival of peace, everybody laughing.  
>  She, though, herself showed work, according to the numbers.

A curious fact is that [Isabel dos Santos
launched](http://tpa.sapo.ao/noticias/economia/depois-de-exoneracao-da-
sonangol-isabel-dos-santos-lanca-marca-de-cerveja) a brand of beer days later
in Angola, which led some to think that it was a way of distracting attention
from the dismissal. This prompted [Yuri
Aiss](https://www.facebook.com/yuri.doscaumante/posts/2085684358338136) to
comment:

> Um dos métodos mais rápido para destruir a sociedade Angolana, ela até já
> conhece o ponto fraco dos Angolanos

> One of the quickest methods of destroying Angolan society, she still already
> knows Angolans’ weak point

parties said the dismissal was a good decision and was welcomed:

> A UNITA, maior partido da oposição, considera a exoneração de Isabel dos
> Santos do cargo de presidente do Conselho de Administração da Sonangol
> “normal” e a CASA-CE, a segunda mais importante força política da oposição
> no Parlamento, aponta a decisão do Presidente da República como “bem-vinda”.

> to be “normal” and CASA-CE, the second most important political opposition

> “welcome”.
