Following a high-profile election campaign that culminated in his arrest at
his final rally, [Ugandan pop star Robert Kyagulanyi
Ssentamu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ssentamu_Kyagulanyi), famously
known as [Bobi Wine](https://www.youtube.com/user/omubandarealityshow), is now
officially a politician.

Wine is not new to activism. His music has for a while been focused on social
justice issues. But singing about policy issues is not enough. On 29 June, he
finally crossed the line to become a policy maker after securing a
parliamentary seat in Kyadondo, [winning
75%](http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1456687/bobi-wine-wins-
kyandondo-east-seat) of the votes in a by-election.

He began singing about social justice in 2005. During the 2016 general
election he refused to take part in a song that praised and campaigned for
incumbent President Museveni — who has been in office for three decades — to
stay in power. Many top musicians took part in the
[song](https://youtu.be/-4JhrmVpL68) that Wine
[refused](http://www.howwe.biz/news/comedy/10500/tell-the-president-the-truth-
bobi-wine-hits-at-tubonge-singers) to take part in.

One of his more popular songs, “Ghetto”, talks about police brutality against
people residing in the slums of Kampala and the inadequate services that
delivered to them.

Wine refers to himself as “The Ghetto President” and “Omubanda Wakabaka,”
loosely translated as “The King’s Gang Star”. He is the fifth person from the
country's art fraternity to go into politics, following in the footsteps of
Ali Ndawula Wowoto, [Sulaiman
Madada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulaiman_Madada), [Judith
Babirye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Babirye) and Kato Lubwama, who
now serve as members of parliament.

His campaign was characterized by music, with large numbers of musicians,
radio personalities and TV presenters turning up and using their social media
accounts to push his message to the electorate, employing the hashtag
[#BikwaseKyagulanyi](https://web.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%23BikwaseKyagulanyi),
which means “hand over everything to Kyagulanyi” _.

At his final rally, he was
[arrested](http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1456465/kyadondo-east-
race-bobi-wine-arrested) by the police, who alleged that Wine was holding the
gathering in a wrong venue close to where President Museveni was campaigning
for his candidate. The video below by NTV Uganda, a local broadcaster, shows
him being detained. He pleads with the police, saying he is fighting for
people's rights.

Nevertheless, he won the by-election handily. He secured 25,659 votes,
defeating Sitenda Sebalu, the ruling NRM party candidate, who only received
4,556 votes. Wine's platform focusing on unemployment and other issues that
affect youth, who he believes are misrepresented, captured huge amounts of
support.

After he was announced as the winner of the election, he tweeted to his 28,000
followers that something profound has happened in Uganda's electoral politics.

> THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN  
>  This 29th day of June marks a turning point in the politics of our country!

Ugandans took to social media to congratulate the 35 year-old celebrated
artist on his election into Parliament. The list of supporters included
politicians, musicians and ordinary people on the media platforms.

A few hours before the electoral commission announced the results, NRM
Secretary General Justine Lumumba tweeted his message of congratulations:

> Congratulations to the people of Kyadondo East, congratulations to
> [@BobiWineOmuband](https://twitter.com/BobiWineOmuband) Kyagulanyi Robert
> Sentamu.

And Kizza Besigye, the first runner up in the 2016 presidential campaign, also
came out to applauded Bobi Wine's victory; Besigye never campaigned for him as
his party had fronted another candidate in the election:

> Landslide victory for the HE Bobi Wine. Congratulations-PEOPLE POWER!!
> That's why Wakiso people weren't allowed to vote 2016.

Fellow musicians Radio and Weasel also
[thanked](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1536584379716645&id=184127148295715)
Bobi Wine for his efforts towards giving the poor a voice through his music
and now in politics as well:

> You Have Brought The Ghetto UpTown. Congrats Broda [Bobi

In the past, Bobi Wine was known for the use of marijuana and
[beefing](https://www.jamiiforums.com/threads/bobi-wine-beats-up-bebe-
cool.30935/) with fellow musician Bebe Cool. Yet the people of Kyadondo East
were willing to overlook those things and elected him to parliament. The
challenge for him going forward is to ensure that he works hard to catch up to
his fellow parliamentarians that have been in the legislature for more than a
year and deliver on the expectations of the people he represents and the
country at large.
