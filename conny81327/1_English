A July 2019 NYT job ad for Nairobi bureau chief is chock full of clichés about
Africa referencing the “shores of Tanzania” and the “deserts of Sudan.” Photo

used with permission.

On July 3, 2019, the New York Times announced a [job
ad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/nairobi-bureau-chief-at-the-new-york-
times-1332110667/?originalSubdomain=ke&fbclid=IwAR0f2KExCDtnOu6n-9zSotlZ-N0MkTHXO9WWFyAVmVK7ZIrF0Z6KF7Cs2a4)
in search of the next bureau chief for its Nairobi, Kenya, office. The
reductive language used to describe the ideal candidate’s role and
responsibilities has reignited the debate on Western media's trafficking of
tired stereotypes about Africa.

The first few lines of the ad states:

> Our Nairobi bureau chief has a tremendous opportunity to dive into news and
> enterprise across a wide range of countries, from the deserts of Sudan and
> the pirate seas of the Horn of Africa, down through the forests of Congo and
> the shores of Tanzania.

Many who read it had to stop there — “from the deserts of Sudan and the pirate
seas of the Horn of Africa …?” Netizens on Twitter began to comment
immediately about how the author of this ad had taken instructions from “[How
To Write About Africa](https://granta.com/how-to-write-about-africa/),” by the
[late Kenyan writer Binyavanga
Wainaina](https://globalvoices.org/2019/05/23/kenyan-writer-binyavanga-
wainaina-who-taught-the-world-how-to-write-about-africa-dies-at-48/) — without
getting the memo that he was being sarcastic.

But it doesn’t stop:

> It is an enormous patch of vibrant, intense and strategically important
> territory with many vital story lines, including terrorism, the scramble for
> resources, the global contest with China and the constant push-and-pull of
> democracy versus authoritarianism.

East Africa, described as an “enormous patch”? A region reduced to “vital
storylines” such as “terrorism, the scramble for resources, the global contest
with China?” Netizens pointed out that the ad clearly relies on [tired,
colonial-era](https://citizentv.co.ke/news/unexpected-stories-of-hope-new-

tropes about Africa:

The ad continues:

> hope and the changing rhythms of life in a rapidly evolving region.

To which journalist Larry Madowo tweeted:

> As a lifelong African, I’m overjoyed that a benevolent New York Times

Netizens on Twitter came out in full force to condemn the NYT for the ad.

Kenyan storytellers, Lam Sisterhood, created a spoken word performance piece
out of the NYT ad, calling attention to problematic words, phrases and lines
that reinforce disturbing, reductive notions of Kenya, East Africa and the
continent. The video was retweeted nearly 240 times in a 24-hour period:

> Dear [@nytimes](https://twitter.com/nytimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

> We made this for you

> Love,

Kenyan filmmaker Jim Chuchu called up the “Tarzan” image:

> to hire Tarzan as the next East Africa Bureau Chief. 😩 A stark reminder that

Political analyst Ryan Cummings suggested “Indiana Jones” as the perfect
candidate:

Both characters match the cliché adventure types common in Nairobi, who
Wainaina[
described](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMyU8n_fXXsC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=Will+Never+Be+A+Kenyan+Cowboy:&source=bl&ots=k1kWXa0mBB&sig=ACfU3U3cKEcEBQ64YMqWa4Biw09hNWYKqg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj18Mym1J7jAhWIQs0KHbaSC94Q6AEwEXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Will%20Never%20Be%20A%20Kenyan%20Cowboy%3A&f=false)
as a “Will Never Be Kenya Cowboy”:

> fail and then write a book about Their Time In Africa when they Dodged

### NYT history in Kenya

The NYT is not new to pushback in Nairobi in its handling of stories from the
region.

When a deadly terrorist attack struck the Dusit Hotel in Riverside in Nairobi
in January 2019, killing 15 and wounding over 30, then-incoming bureau chief,
Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, wrote a controversial [article
](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/world/africa/nairobi-attack.html?smid=tw-
nytimes&smtyp=cur)about it for the NYT, which featured graphic photos of slain
victims covered with blood.

The images invoked local and global fury for being insensitive, inappropriate
and [dishonorable.](https://theconversation.com/why-photographs-of-dead-in-
nairobi-terror-attack-failed-journalism-and-dishonoured-victims-110010) Many
also called out the double standard that led to publishing these images,
suggesting that had the victims been white, the NYT would not have published
them.

Kenyans on Twitter, or [#KOT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/KOT?src=hash), first
waged their collective rage directly at de Freytas-Tamura, calling for her
resignation and deportation. But de Freytas-Tamura pointed to the NYT’s photo
department who approved the photos.

Kenya’s Media Council gave the NYT [24
hours](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/686144953/in-bad-taste-disrespectful-
photo-of-terror-attack-in-kenya-sparks-controversy) to [take down the
article](https://twitter.com/MediaCouncilK/status/1085869526032531457) and
photos from their website, but the newspaper did not budge — or apologize:

> [@mediacouncilk](https://twitter.com/MediaCouncilK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> today officially wrote a protest note to
> [@nytimes](https://twitter.com/nytimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) over it's

> 2019](https://twitter.com/MediaCouncilK/status/1085869526032531457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The NYT responded:

> We have heard from some readers upset with our publishing a photo showing
> victims after a brutal attack in Nairobi. We understand how painful this
> coverage can be, and we try to be very sensitive in how we handle both words
> and images in these situations. <https://t.co/Qjm0qBMaF3>

Kenyans [reacted](https://theconversation.com/why-photographs-of-dead-in-
nairobi-terror-attack-failed-journalism-and-dishonoured-victims-110010) so
strongly against de Freytas-Tamura — even threatening her life — that the NYT
eventually shifted de Freytas-Tamura back to the London office. She never did
assume her role officially as Nairobi bureau chief — and the controversial
photos remain online.

### ‘Love, Africa’

Another former NYT Nairobi bureau chief, award-winning journalist Jeffrey
Gettleman, also raised eyebrows with his recent book “Love, Africa.” The book
cover depicts the [classic tree and sunset](https://qz.com/207527/the-reason-
every-book-about-africa-has-the-same-cover-and-its-not-pretty/) and speaks to
colonial overtones and fascination with “othering” Africa.

In a [review](http://aidnography.blogspot.com/2017/09/love-africa-romance-war-
survival-jeffrey-gettleman-book-review.html) of Gettleman’s book, German
anthropologist, Tobias Denskus, concludes:

> On further reflection, … his narrative seems a bit outdated, maybe even out
> of touch with the changing realities around him and the expectations from
> privileged global professionals.

### Kenyans reclaim narratives on social media

Kenyans on Twitter do not only target the NYT. Several other examples point to
moments when Kenyan Twitter came out to admonish and correct offensive
language that perpetuates tropes and stereotypes about Africa.

In 2012, when Korean Airways launched Nairobi as a destination, it
[released](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2012/06/kenyans-full-of-primitive-
energy/) an advert that said: “Fly Korean Air and enjoy the grand African
Savanna, the safari tour, and the indigenous people full of primitive energy.”
The [advert ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PJbVSdrFns)went [viral
](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2012/06/kenyans-full-of-primitive-
energy/)and unleashed a flood of tweets calling for Korean Air to reconsider
flying to Kenya.

In 2015, when CNN labeled Kenya [“a hotbed of
terror”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news-19-0/someonetellcnn-kenyans-
ridicule-us-network-on-twitter-for-hotbed-of-terror-report-10410337.html)
ahead of United States President Barack Obama’s visit, over 75,000 tweets
within a single day protested the stereotype.[

network-on-twitter-for-hotbed-of-terror-report-10410337.html)

### The dark continent?

Perhaps the NYT is numb to loud reactions. The new ad clearly falls into the
old “dark continent” trap.

Seven years after Welsh 19th century explorer, [Henry Morton
Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morton_Stanley), cast Africa as
“[the dark continent](https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7770/)” — based on
[travels](https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7770/) to Central and East Africa that
resulted in a published 1878 travelogue, “In Darkest Africa” — the [Berlin
Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin) divided up Africa
for “European powers’ [pleasure and
profit](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4620852?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).”

Africa as a “dark continent” still persists in current Western mainstream
media imaginations.

When University of Stanford media scholar, Toussaint Nothias,
[analysed](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2016.1262748)
over 282 articles published in British and French newspapers between 2007 and
2012, he identified a systematic portrayal of Africa with “darkness” and
“tribalism” that treated Africa as a “homogenous entity” with coverage that
relies “predominantly on Western sources.”

Cameroonian historian and philosopher, Achille Mbembe, uses the term[
“absolute
otherness”](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-030-04941-6_8-1)
to describe how the West positions itself toward Africa. What Africa is — the
West is not. The need to negate and contrast brightness with darkness still
dominates the West’s perception of its relationship with the other.

Let’s try to imagine the reverse, Jim Chuchu suggests:

> Let's imagine the reverse: “African news agency seeking correspondents to
> cover America: a vibrant territory with many vital storylines, including
> inexplicable gun laws, the global contest with China, and a penchant for
> overthrowing foreign governments for sport”.

Chibuke Oguh, a Nigerian scholar, [argues
](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292141961_The_Representation_of_Africa_in_Western_Media_still_a_21st_century_problem)that
this kind of framing ignores the continent’s many historical as well as
contemporary “political and economic success stories.”

Communicating these anachronistic ideas about Africa makes satire relevant —
but it still doesn’t answer why the NYT got this so wrong.

_Editor's note: Global Voices reached out several times to the NYT for an
official comment without a response. On July 8, international editor Michael
Slackman[responded](https://twitter.com/meslackman/status/1147980092343312384)
on Twitter in direct response to Lam Sisterhood and claimed responsibility for
the ad with an explanation. We will update again as necessary. _
