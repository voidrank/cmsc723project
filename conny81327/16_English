The remains of what was once the largest slave trade port in the Americas came
to the surface in 2011 after almost 200 years buried, when construction work
on Rio de Janeiro's port area [began
](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/07/09/politica/1499625756_209845.html)as
part of the city's preparations ahead of the Olympic Games it would host five
years later.

In July 2017, UNESCO certified the place as a World Heritage Site, with the
purpose of turning the long-lost stones of Cais do Valongo into a memorial
site.

The recognition from the United Nations’ educational, scientific and cultural
arm forces Brazil to recognize a period of its history that the country still
struggles to fully confront. Brazil was the last country in the Americas to
abolish slavery, doing so in 1888. The slave trade, however, became illegal in
1843 and Valongo lost its purpose. According to the online historical database
[Slave Voyages](http://www.slavevoyages.org):

> Brazil was the center of the slave trade carried on under the Portuguese
> flag, both before and after Brazilian independence, in 1822, and Portugal
> was by far the largest of the national carriers. Brazil dominated the slave
> trade in the sense that Rio de Janeiro and Bahia sent out more more slaving
> voyages than any port in Europe […] Over nearly three centuries between 1560
> and 1850, Brazil was consistently the largest destination for slaves in the
> Americas.

Valongo’s Quay was created in 1811 — three years after the arrival of
Portugal's royal family, who were escaping Napoleon's army in Europe — and
soon became the main destination for ships bringing enslaved people to the
Americas. Historian Lilian Moritz Schwarcz, who is a scholar in São Paulo’s
University and a Global Scholar Program participant at Princeton University in
the US, [explains](https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2017/O-Cais-do-
Valongo) that it was located only a few steps away from the royal palace and
during their walks, the monarchs would often watch traders preparing “their
products” — separating families and rubbing whale oil on the enslaved
Africans’ bodies to cover any wounds:

> O Brasil recebeu mais de 4 milhões de africanos, durante os (quase) quatro
> séculos em que foi vigente o regime escravocrata no país. Tal número
> equivale a um pouco menos do que a metade da população que deixou seu
> continente de origem, forçadamente, e àqueles que lograram chegar vivos nas
> Américas, depois de uma viagem repleta de contrariedades. Desse número
> absoluto, aproximadamente 60% aportaram no Rio de Janeiro, e cerca de um
> milhão deles entraram no território pelo Cais do Valongo.

> Brazil received more than 4 million Africans, during the (almost) four
> centuries the country had a regime of enslavement. That number is equivalent
> to a little less than half of [all the Africans] who left their continent of
> origin, forcibly, and managed to arrive at the Americas alive, after a long
> journey full of adversities. From this absolute number, nearly 60% docked at
> Rio de Janeiro and about 1 million entered by Valongo’s Quay.

Which means that in 32 years of operation, Valongo not only became the most
trafficked slave port, but also received a quarter of all enslaved Africans
who ever entered Brazil throughout the centuries that the system endured. When
Brazil's National Historical and Artistic Patrimony Institute (IPHAN)
presented the site as a candidate to UNESCO, its then President Kátia Bogéa
[explained](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/07/09/politica/1499625756_209845.html)
that Valongo was “the only [site] representing millions of African people who
were enslaved and worked to build Brazil as a nation, creating the largest
black people population outside of Africa”.

As Schwarcz puts it in her [recent
article](https://www.nexojornal.com.br/colunistas/2017/O-Cais-do-Valongo)
about the heritage title, in Brazil’s case having this historical site
recognized is more than a matter of memory. It’s about “closing the door on
oblivion”:

> Não se trata de condenar essas populações a seu passado, até porque ninguém
> foi escravo de origem e nascença. Mas sim de lembrar e elevar essa África
> que vive em nós. Conforme define, lindamente, Alberto da Costa e Silva,
> nosso maior africanista: “O Brasil é um país extraordinariamente
> africanizado. E só a quem não conhece a África pode escapar o quanto há de
> africano nos gestos, nas maneiras de ser e de viver e no sentimento estético
> do brasileiro. (…) Com ou sem remorsos, a escravidão é o processo mais longo
> e mais importante de nossa história.

> It’s not about condemning these populations to their past, especially
> because no one was a slave by origin or birth. But it’s about remembering
> and elevating the Africa that lives in us. As Alberto da Costa e Silva, our
> greatest Africanist, beautifully defines: ‘Brazil is an extraordinarily
> Africanized country. And only someone who doesn’t know Africa can escape how
> much of it there is in our gestures, in how we live and be, in our esthetic

> important process in our history.
