Teodorín N. O. Mangue and his father at the United Nations – public domain

Despite his attorneys’ many objections, the trial of Mr. Teodorín Nguema
Obiang Mangue, vice president and son of the dictator of Equatorial Guinea,
opened in Paris on June 19, 2017. The Parisian court will examine the charges
against Teodorín, including “laundering of misused public funds”,
“embezzlement of public funds”, “violation of the public trust”, and
“corruption”. The [suit
](https://www.afriqueconnection.com/article/20-06-2017/chaude-ambiance-au-
premier-jour-du-procès-des-«-biens-mal-acquis-») was brought by two non-
governmental organizations, Sherpa and Transparency International.

The website ccfd-terresolidaire.org [explains the origin ](http://ccfd-
terresolidaire.org/IMG/pdf/biens-mal-acquis.pdf)of this case of “[ill-gotten
wealth](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_mal_acquis)“:

> En mars 2007, le CCFD-Terre solidaire mettait en ligne un document de
> travail intitulé [« Biens mal acquis… profitent trop souvent. La fortune des
> dictateurs et les complaisances occidentales »](http://ccfd-
> terresolidaire.org/IMG/pdf/biens-mal-acquis.pdf).
>
> Téléchargée plus de 100 000 fois et support des plaintes déposées en France
> contre Omar Bongo, Denis Sassou Nguesso et Teodoro Obiang Nguema, et en
> Espagne contre ce dernier, cette étude allait faire date.
>
> Deux ans plus tard, en 2009, l’étude fut entièrement réécrite et actualisée
> dans un nouveau rapport actualisé[« _Biens mal acquis, à qui profite le
> crime_](http://ccfd-terresolidaire.org/IMG/pdf/BMA_totalBD.pdf)[
> _?_](http://ccfd-terresolidaire.org/IMG/pdf/BMA_totalBD.pdf) ». Ce rapport
> passait en revue les avoirs détournés de plus de 30 dirigeants de pays en
> développement.
>
> Le CCFD-Terre Solidaire estime qu’au cours des dernières décennies, entre
> 105 et 180 milliards de dollars ont été volés par une trentaine de
> dirigeants autoritaires et kleptocrates de plusieurs continents (Afrique,
> Asie, Amérique du Sud). Pour leur part, la Banque Mondiale et les Nations
> unies estiment que ce sont entre 20 et 40 milliards de dollars qui, chaque
> année, fuient les pays en développement du fait de la corruption.

> In March 2007, CCFD-Terre Solidaire (Catholic Committee Against Hunger and
> For Development) posted a discussion paper online entitled [‘Ill-Gotten
> Gains…Too Often Won: The Wealth of Dictators and Western Complacency’.
> ](http://ccfd-terresolidaire.org/IMG/pdf/biens-mal-acquis.pdf)The landmark
> study, downloaded over 100,000 times, backed up the charges made in France
> against Omar Bongo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, and Teodoro Obiang Nguema. The
> latter was also pursued in Spain. An updated version of the report was
> published two years later in 2009, entitled: [ ‘Ill-Gotten Gains… Cui
> Bono?’](http://ccfd-terresolidaire.org/IMG/pdf/BMA_totalBD.pdf). This report

The defendant, who could afford a long legal procedure, engaged in a battle
with France that has now lasted ten years. Kouamé L. – PH. Arnaud KOUAKOU from
burkina24.com [lays out ](https://burkina24.com/2017/06/20/biens-mal-acquis-
teodorin-obiang-absent-a-louverture-de-son-proces/) the facts:

> > Il y a dix ans de cela, les ONG Sherpa et Transparency International
> déposaient leurs premières plaintes à l’encontre de Teodorin Obiang pour des
> _« biens mal acquis»_.
>>

>> Le temps qui s’écoule entre ces premières plaintes et l’ouverture de ce
procès est émaillé d’un enchaînement de rebondissements politico-judiciaires,
marqué de saisies des biens du fils du président, voitures et montres de luxe
et immobilier à Paris…

>>

>> L’accusé n’a pas daigné faire le déplacement parisien et s’est fait
représenter par trois avocats dont la stratégie, selon Africanews, a consisté
à mettre en avant l’immunité diplomatique dont il bénéficie en tant que
deuxième personnage d’un Etat.

> Ten years ago, the NGOs Sherpa and Transparency International filed their
> first complaints against Teodorin Obiang concerning his ‘ill-gotten wealth’.
> From that point until the opening of the case against the president’s son,
> there was a series of legal twists and turns and asset seizures: exotic
> cars, luxury watches, and real estate in Paris. The defendant did not deign
> to travel to Paris and was represented by three lawyers there. According to
> Africanews, their strategy consisted in arguing that he benefits from
> diplomatic immunity, as he is vice president of a foreign government.

Though its population totals just 759,451, Equatorial Guinea is the seventh
highest oil-producing country in Africa. In 2008, the income per capita
reached the sum of [$41,267.13
](http://perspective.usherbrooke.ca/bilan/servlet/BMTendanceStatPays?langue=fr&codePays=GNQ&codeTheme=2&codeStat=NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD),
higher than that of Germany in 2015, at
[$41,178.50](http://donnees.banquemondiale.org/indicateur/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD). The
country’s economy depends on this production and the income per capita
decreased to [$14,439.60 in 2015
](http://donnees.banquemondiale.org/indicateur/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) due to the fall
in oil prices over the past few years. This is still higher than several
European Union member states, and Equatorial Guineans are the richest Africans
on average.

Unfortunately, this is only true in theory since the riches surging from under
ground and sea are poorly distributed. Though the ruling class grew more
wealthy, spending in the public domain didn’t increase. Summarizing a report
it published, the human rights defender Human Rights Watch [
stated](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/equatorialguinea0617fr_summandrecs_web_0.pdf):

> For example, the vaccination rates are some of the worst in the world.
> Vaccination against tuberculosis in newborn babies and infants fell from 99%
> in 1997 to 35% in 2015. More than half of the population of Equatorial
> Guinea does not have access to safe drinking water nearby, a rate which
> hasn’t changed since 1995. In 2012, 42% of primary school-aged children
> (46,000 children) did not attend school, ranking seventh in the world.

[Prestige spending
](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/equatorialguinea0617fr_summandrecs_web_0.pdf)
has increased, absorbing enormous sums for the benefit of a privileged
minority. In a statement on hrw.org, researcher Sarah Saadoun called on
President Macron to go further in the fight against money laundering and
[condemned ](https://www.hrw.org/fr/news/2017/06/20/biens-mal-acquis-la-
guinee-equatoriale-est-un-cas-decole-en-matiere-de-predation) such practices:

> The most expensive and perplexing [project](http://www.lemonde.fr/projet/)
> is the new capital, Oyala, right in the middle of the jungle. It's the third
> capital in this country of one million inhabitants. After spending billions

Between prestigious residences in enchanting locations, luxury cars,
collections of Hollywood and sports memorabilia, and tax havens, the vice
president of Equatorial Guinea doesn’t hold back on his self-indulgence. For
example, the site vesper.media [reveals](https://vesper.media/teodorin-obiang-
apres-voitures-voici-yachts/) that the value of his two yachts, Ebony Shine,
75.75 meters long and Ice, 90 meters, is equivalent to ten times the annual
education budget in Equatorial Guinea and seventeen times that of the public
health. The maintenance alone of Ebony Shine would cost “approximately
$800,000 per month, not including fuel”.

His father, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has been in power since
1979 and was reelected in 2016 with 93.7% of the vote. As usual, he named a
new government in which the juiciest positions went to family members and
allies. In an article entitled ****[ ‘Equatorial Guinea: The State in the
Hands of the Presidential Family’](http://www.africa-info.org/combien-payez-
vous/9595-guinee-equatoriale-l-etat-aux-mains-de-la-famille-
presidentielle.html), published last September, Ondo Ololobi lists the
presidential family members who are part of the government and reveals the
immense wealth of Mrs. Constancia Mangue de Obiang, the most powerful
personage in the regime. Excerpt:

> She is Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo’s wife. The president has fallen
> completely under her influence. She uses all kinds of subterfuge and abuse
> of authority to elevate her first son, Teodorín Nguema Obiang Mangue, to the
> Equatorial Guinean presidency. She is very discreet, a multibillionaire, and
> she rarely appears on the political scene. She is, however, the one pulling
> the strings at the presidential palace behind the scenes. Through her
> cunning, she was able to place 30 out of 70 ministers (for a country of
> 710,000 inhabitants) in the government, all of whom come from the
> presidential clan.

The site diariorombe.es [tells us ](https://diariorombe.es/teodoro-nguema-

PDGE)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_d%C3%A9mocratique_de_Guin%C3%A9e_%C3%A9quatoriale
"Parti démocratique de Guinée équatoriale"), invited the population to take
part in a peaceful — but obligatory — demonstration of support in front of the
embassy of France in Malabo. This baron among the barons, who seems to like
cash, had his residence burglarized twice. The first time, the thieves
allegedly got away with more than [ 39 billion FCFA [48,640,000 euros]
