Several bloggers expressed their disgust at learning that Afghans living in
[Isfahan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan), Iran were banned from a park
by the authorities on April 1, 2012, the 13th day of
[Nowruz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz) New Year celebrations. It is
customary to mark this day by spending the day outdoors picnicking.

Although an official in Isfahan
[denied](http://www.magiran.com/npview.asp?ID=2472657) [fa] that Afghans had
been targeted, a Facebook event was created to
[encourage](https://www.facebook.com/events/302662013136917/) Iranians to
fight racism. The logo on the page says, “We are all Afghans”. Nearly 4000
people supported the campaign.

Aside from many legal Afghan immigrants and refugees, over one million
undocumented Afghan refugees currently live in Iran, according to [some
reports](http://www.presstv.ir/detail/200384.html).

Iranian blogger Sepid and Siah (meaning White and Black)[
says](http://seyahsefid.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/blog-post_31.html) [fa]:

> My Afghan brother and sister I am ashamed. I am ashamed that my country
> where you took refuge, is not a good host to you… But what can I expect from
> some people within establishment who try to humiliate you for years, they
> have already humiliated Iranians. But I am ashamed that my own people do not
> understand you.

Shahin Shar blog
[says](http://shahinshahri.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%86%DA%98%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%85/)
[fa] let's end racism against Afghans today in Iran. The blogger has published
several photos showing, in one case, how Afghans are banned from a swimming
pool.

Because of the heavy censorship in Iran may we never know what really happened
that day in the park. Meanwhile we can be sure that many Iranians know there
is persistant discrimination against Afghans, and they wish to turn a page.
