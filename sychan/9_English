Hiyam Hijazi-Omari and Rivka Ribak wrote a paper called [“Playing With Fire:
On the domestication of the mobile phone among Palestinian teenage girls in
Israel”](http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/com/faculty-panorama/AoIR-final-
draft-2007.pdf). In their research, they analyzed mobile phone practices among
Palestinian teenage girls in Israel. The Paper constructs a detailed account
of mobile phone use among Palestinian Israeli girls who, at the time of the
fieldwork (2003-2006), used mobile phones given to them by their illicit
boyfriends, unbeknownst to their parents.

No doubt mobile communications technology is enabling teens in the Middle East
to bypass cultural norms by providing them with access to private
communication channels. More examples:

of Bluetooth in the UAE for guys sending private notes to girls in public.
