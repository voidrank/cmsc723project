One Day on Earth

The collaborative film [One Day on Earth](http://www.onedayonearth.org/ "One
Day on Earth site") was filmed all on the same day, October 10, 2010, with
more than 3,000 hours of footage sent in from all corners of the world,
showcasing the amazing diversity, conflict, tragedy, and triumph that occurs
in one day. The [Global Screening](http://www.onedayonearth.org/screening "One
day on earth screening") will take place on Earth Day (April 22, 2012) in
every country of the world, with the assistance of World Heritage Sites and
the United Nations.
