Norway is widely known for hosting the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize Awards.
This month, the Scandinavian country is hosting the debut of another important
yet largely unknown journalism award ceremony for the [World Indigenous
Television Broadcasters Network (WITBN)](http://www.witbn.org/) on March 29,
2012.

Nine finalists have been selected out of 24 entries in the indepth reporting
category of the WITBN Indigenous Journalism Awards (2012 WIJA). The ceremony
will be held in Kautokeino, Sápmi, Norway.

The official [announcement](http://witbn.org/index.php/wija2012/press-release)
from WIJA explains:

> 2012 WIJA is the first international Indigenous journalism award dedicated
> to presenting Indigenous perspectives through journalism in television and
> audiovisual media. While journalistic standards and ethics are the essences
> of this honor, the awards in particular look for the portrayal of Indigenous
> perspectives on stories of local, national or international impact.

This videos shows the 2012 finalists from indigenous networks in developed
countries such as Taiwan, Australia, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, and the
United States.

One of the nominated programs, from Māori Television, Aotearoa New Zealand,
covers what should be labeled as “Occupy Easter Island” (it started a year
before the Occupy movement in the U.S.), a rarely reported protest by
[Rapanui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapa_Nui_people) activists who occupied
a government-owned hotel for half a year, demanding recognition of Indigenous
rights and demonstrating the unfairness of occupation.

[Easter Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island) (or Rapa Nui) is a
land where colonization has forced the indigenous population to a small corner
of the land, and where tourism had created an unsustainable economy. The
sustainability problem is widespread in indigenous peoples’ struggles all over
the world to survive and preserve their culture.

The indigenous use of broadcast journalism and modern technology to promote
the rights of their communities is a step forward. Read more about the
