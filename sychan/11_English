A senior parliamentarian and one of the most important ministers in the
present government was assassinated by the LTTE. The bomber is believed to
have come disguised as a Marathon runner.
_[DefenseNet](http://defencenet.blogspot.com)_ gives a brief update of the
incident, but the post created some heated debate and in my opinion it gives a
glimpse of the average Sri Lankan's mind, who are so used to people getting
killed by bomb blasts. Below are some of the comments, read the full post

Other than the minister close to 10 people have died and among them is
**national marathon champion Mr.Karunasena** better known and “Marathon Karu”
and **National Athletic Coach Mr.Lackshman De Alwis**.[ _About Sri
Lanka_](http://aboutsrilanka.blogspot.com) speaks about the other prominent
people injured in [this post](http://aboutsrilanka.blogspot.com/2008/04/sri-
lankan-mp-jeyaraj-fernandopulle.html).

Meanwhile, the war continues in Sri Lanka with government claiming to kill
many Tiger cadres while LTTE denies them strenuously, what most people don't
hear about is the displaced people because of the war, who live in refugee
camps, sometimes denied even the basic human needs, although the government
speaks highly about the liberation of North not much is mentioned about the
displaced persons.

[_ground views_ __](http://www.groundviews.org/)speaks about forgotten IDP's
from the North where he mentions the hardships the Muslims and the other in
that area had to suffer for more than two decades.

Although not as unforgiving as ground views
_[transcurrent.com](http://transcurrent.com/)_ also speaks about the
[difficulties faced by the
IDP's](http://transcurrents.com/tamiliana/archives/471) especially about the
security concerns faced by them.

> looting; threats and attacks upon individuals by irregular and armed groups
> such as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP), including infiltration
> of camps at night; incomplete or delayed mine-clearance; approaches used by
