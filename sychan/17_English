_Layal El Katib_ , is a [Lebanese Blogger](http://lebnights.blogspot.com) who
lived in Egypt for a while, and here are her experiences as a Lebanese living
in Egypt:

> I used to speak Egyptian there, in fact nobody would know I'm Lebanese
> unless somebody tells them, my Egyptian accent was (and still is) flawless!  
>  So, I didn't experience any kind of problems! it was very normal and it
> felt like home..At school, I made great friends, we were a family, you know
> hanging out with the same friends everyday for several years, the bond
> becomes stronger than the family blood because you get to choose your
> friends! I used to love the first day at school just to meet the new people!
> I've always loved company and I never had a problem to blend in ANY kind of
> groups.

But one day, a [single incident](http://lebnights.blogspot.com/2008/02/on-
being-lebanese-female-in-egypt-part.html) at school really affected her:

> Anyways, years passed by and I'm in an Arabic period in Grade 6. I don't
> remember what the teacher was talking about but I remember him saying “And
> Of course, We all know that Lebanon is being occupied now by Israel…”. I
> wasn't shocked by what he said, I was shocked by the whole class's reaction!
> It was nothing but a big “BOOOOOOO” accompanied by fingers pointed at me! I
> can't describe how it felt! But it was so weird and shocking that I didn't
> do anything but smiling! In the very same day, during the recess, I remember
> bursting into tears on my best friend's shoulder!  
>  I didn't cry because of the occupation thing, I didn't cry because the
> teacher said that the whole Lebanese soil was occupied and that he was
> wrong, I did because it was the first time I felt like a stranger, a
> minority or an intruder!

Then a [few years](http://lebnights.blogspot.com/2008/03/on-being-lebanese-
female-in-egypt-part.html) later:

> So I'm still in Egypt, still at the same school, same friends, same
> street…etc. It's the year 2000, the year when the Zionist army finally left
> the Lebanese Soil (except for Shebaa farms) because of the amazing Lebanese
> resistance.

She continues:

> We went out later that day, I can't remember where. But I remember that when
> we reached the apartment's door, a guy approached us and said “Mabrouk,
> Rafa3to Rasna” (Meaning Congrats, You honored us). I can't describe how I
> felt. It was simply amazing.  
>  That stranger and few (1 or 2) close friends probably were the only persons
> who congratulated us. My friends were happy for me when I told them about
> it. It didn't bother me really that they didn't call, and it doesn't bother
> me even now. We Arabs are weird! They're the same friends who BOOed, and I'm
> the same person who cried!!! It was still Egypt, and it was still Lebanon.
> Isn't it logical for the BOO to become a YAAY?
