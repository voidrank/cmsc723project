[Self-censorship on
YouTube](http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/2007/08/30/youtube-agrees-to-
self-censorship/ "YouTube Agrees to Self-Censorship") is working well –
silently. Yesterday, a FACT signer reported one of the silently banned clips,
which can be viewed everywhere in the world, except Thailand.

Since agreement with Thailand's [Ministry of Information and Communication
Technology](http://www.mict.go.th/) last year, [YouTube's management agreed to
block](http://www.nowpublic.com/thai-ban-youtube-lifted "Thai ban on YouTube
lifted") any video clips deemed offensive to Thai people or those that violate
Thai law. In other words, YouTube will do the censorship by themselves, so
that the site [will not be blocked
again](http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9769669-7.html "Thailand reopens
YouTube access, but with limits") by the Ministry.

When users from Thailand try to access the reported link,
<http://youtube.com/watch?v=70m1ncXQjXA> , they will find this message:

> _This video is not available in your country._

It is a lèse majesté law protest clip, which contains few caricature of the
King images and Thailand flag, the royal anthem is played as a background
music, and between those images, the clip runs the following messages in black
over yellow background:

> _King Bhumibol Adulyadej of is a dictator._
>
> _He sends anyone who speaks against him to prison – for up to 15 years._
>
> _F**k the king of Thailand – long live free speech!_

Article 112 of the Thai Criminal Code stipulates the penalty for a lèse
majesté offence as 3-15 years’ imprisonment.
