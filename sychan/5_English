On Friday 15th of May, the Brazilian Congress launched an investigation into
the giant state-run oil company
[Petrobras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrobras). The initiative was
started by government leaders of the opposition
[PSDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Social_Democracy_Party) party.
They set up what Brazilians call a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission (CPI is
the abbreviation in Portuguese) to scrutinize supposed irregularities in the
company.

Meanwhile, on the same Friday, Brazilian President Lula da Silva left for a
nine-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India and China (the latter the biggest
Brazilian oil business partner, [which is going to lend 10 billion dollars to
Brazil](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124221412452814823.html)) to hold
negotiations to attract investment in Petrobras, focused in particular on a
specific project: the [“pre-
salt”](http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13348824 ).

Some bloggers do agree with the Senators, who set up the inquiry. They argue
that the company has not been properly run. However, there are others who only
see it as a political issue and even more as an attempt to damage the
company’s image in the long-term and thus, gain popular approval for the
privatization of the whole of Petrobras.

In [_Casa do Noca_](http://casadonoca.blogspot.com/2009/05/petrobrax-vem-
ai.html ) [pt], Lukas reminds us that the same PSDB party tried to privatize
Petrobras and to slowly change the nation’s identification with the company,
even changing its name to Petobrax, as he writes in his post with the heading:
“Petrobrax vem aí?” “Is Petrobrax coming?”

It is totally absurd creating the Petrobras CPI. I did not believe that they
would have that audacity. But recollection and memory always help. And I
remember: this is the PSDB that created and approved the CPI, it is the same
PSDB that GAVE Brazilian patrimony to others.  
And there is more. This PSDB […] is the same one that created Law 9.478 [the
Petroleum Law in 1997], which inconvenienced the Petrobras administration and
resulted in huge losses for the company. But, it is still salvation for the
NATIONAL INTEREST.  
And not to mention the professional Toucan [the bird which symbolizes the PSDB
party] administration’s past attempt to create Petrobrax. […]  
They allowed irresponsible outsourcing in the company, for the benefit of some
but the multiplication of work accidents, with many deaths and damage to the
environment, even leading to the sinking of a petroleum platform.

André Alemão comments on the fact that Petrobras, which was created as a 100%
state-owned company under the Monopoly Law by former Brazilian President
Getúlio Vargas in 1953, has, since 1997, been following new rules created by
former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, of the PSDB party. Cardoso set out
the Petroleum Law, which opened Petrobras up to private companies, and
decreased state-owned shares by 55%. Lula and his government are about to
launch a “regulatory milestone” which is going to establish rules for
petroleum exploration in the area of pre-salt. He writes on the _[_Evaldo
Lima_](http://evaldolima.blogspot.com/2009/05/cpi-da-petrobras.html)_ blog
[pt], that there is no need for a CPI investigation, because the Petrobras
president, Sergio Gabrielli had already said that he would be willing to
present himself before the Congress for a public audience to clarify any
concerns over the company.

“It is clear and obvious that there is no interest on the part of the
opposition to investigate Petrobras, because if there were, they could have
waited until the public audience, but, they took advantage of the absence of
almost all Senators in the Congress to create the CPI. It is a completely
anti-Republican attitude. We do support the idea that all accusations of
irregularities are thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, we cannot accept
this being done as a media spectacular, on the political-election stage, which
can destabilize Petrobras. […]  
In fact, thinking again, for those whom have already tried to privatize and to
destroy this government-owned company, perhaps destroying it is an ideological
option. It does not matter how much Brazil can be broken, there are always
some people who would love to govern under the havoc of this country under
construction.

In [_Claudio Henrique’s_](http://domclaudio.blogspot.com/2009/05/cpi-da-
petrobras.html) [pt] opinion this CPI comes at the wrong time and it is going
to harm the company:

> Para a Petrobras o baque é ainda maior. Se não bastasse a crise, a estatal
> ainda passa por momentos de descobertas e investimentos mais ambiciosos,
> pois a natureza tem sido generosa com a matéria-prima no País. Uma
> investigação destas proporções pode afugentar investidores e até mesmo adiar
> obras estratégicas para o poder Executivo, tais como o PAC.  
>  Mas o epicentro de todos os passos são as eleições de 2010. A tática dos

For Petrobras the impact is even bigger. As if the worldwide economic crisis
were not enough, the state-owned organization is experiencing a period of
discovery and making more ambitious investments, nature has been generous with
raw materials in the country. Investigation on this scale can drive investors
off and even postpone strategic work for the executive branch, such as the
Growth Acceleration Program
([PAC](http://www.coha.org/2008/06/lula’s-brazilian-growth-acceleration-
program-the-best-that-government-funding-can-buy/ )).
