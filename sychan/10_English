[yamabobobo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/monana7/)_[Carolina
Botero,](http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/) lawyer and Creative Commons
promoter in Colombia has been asking bloggers and anyone else with computer
access and an interest in what are popularly called “intellectual property
rights” to sign an open letter which will be sent to CONPES, the National
Council for Social and Economic Politics, to counter a bill the DNP (National
Planning Department) previously sent to them, where the new models of sharing
knowledge that provide alternatives to the traditional “protection and
enforcement” policies were completely ignored.

On Carolina Botero's article, [_Digital Culture is Ignored in the CONPES
Intellectual Property Document
[es]_](http://www.equinoxio.org/destacado/carta-abierta-conpes-plan-accion-
sistema-propiedad-intelectual-2647/) she explains how the National Planning
Department seems to have completely passed over the newer developments
regarding digital media distribution, and points out one by one the cases that
the research done by the DNP missed in their diagnosis.

> Con el documento que se presentará este mes para aprobación en el CONPES
> estamos adoptando como modelo de desarrollo el de “protección y observancia”
> del modelo tradicional de derecho de autor, útil para un mundo de medios
> físicos (impreso, cinta, CD, etc.), pero que no es la única opción en
> entornos digitales ni en los negocios, y además, es excluyente para ciertos
> sectores.

With the document which will be presented this month for CONPES’ approval we
would be adopting as a development model the traditional “protection and
enforcement” one, useful for a physical media world (printed documents, tape,
CDs, etc) but which isn´t the only option in digital environments or business,
and which also ends up excluding other areas.

You can read more details about this letter and proposed bill on
[icommons.org](http://www.icommons.org/), where Carolina compares the new
policies to the cartoon character “Captain Copyright” in _[Captain Copyright
reappears in Colombia.](http://www.icommons.org/articles/captain-copyright-
reappears-in-colombia)_ In the comments, there are discussions regarding the
incorrect bundling of these issues as “intellectual property” and someone the
proposal to create parody comic character who protects copyrights, as a spoof
on _Captain Copyright_.  
The three items requested from the CONPES to take into consideration are
involving government institutions in education and culture to speak out about
their special needs and legal regimes regarding this topic, to involve the
civil society actors who may be interested in this issue, and to start
drafting another document to address the other aspects of the copyright regime
in case this limited document is approved.
