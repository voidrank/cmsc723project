The blogoma is abuzz this week with a smattering of posts about issues
affecting Muslim women, with topics ranging from work programs for women in
Morocco to the mistreatment of gynecologists in Iraq. We'll start off with a
post from [_The View from Fez_](http://riadzany.blogspot.com/2007/11/king-
mohammed-vi-launches-projects-for.html) which unveils an initiative to improve
women's standards of living in the blog's namesake city:

> The first project is a training and qualification centre for women and will
> provide them with training in income-generating professions such as cooking,
> hairdressing, IT, embroidery and weaving. The budget for this project is
> estimated at USD 361,000.  
>  The project, to be built on an area of 950 square meters, will also provide
> orientation and awareness raising, with an ultimate goal of eradicating
> poverty and exclusion of rural populations.

Moving north to France, [_Laila
Lalami_](http://www.lailalalami.com/blog/archives/004924.html) talks about
Joan Scott's _The Politics of the Veil_ , quoting her own article in _[The
Nation](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071210/lalami)_ :

> In her keenly observed book The Politics of the Veil, historian Joan Wallach
> Scott examines the particular French obsession with the foulard, which
> culminated in March 2004 with the adoption of a law that made it illegal for
> students to display any “conspicuous signs” of religious affiliation. The
> law further specified that the Muslim headscarf, the Jewish skullcap and
> large crosses were not to be worn but that “medallions, small crosses, stars
> of David, hands of Fatima, and small Korans” were permitted. Despite the
> multireligious contortions, it was very clear, of course, that the law was
> primarily aimed at Muslim schoolgirls.

Next, _[Myrtus](http://myrtus.typepad.com/myrtus/2007/11/the-first-
musli.html)_ [shares a link](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/919115.html)
about Israel's first female bus driver. _[Margot the Marrakesh
Mystic](http://www.typepad.com/t/comments?__mode=red&user_id=668480&id=90208880)_
comments:

> We've had women police [in Marrakesh] for three or four years now, but they
> are not allowed to carry guns (unlike the men) and they are not allowed to
> work overnight.  
>  It seems I heard last year about the first woman taxi driver in Marrakesh.
> I haven't seen her, and she probably isn't allowed to work after a certain
> time at night, either.

_Myrtus_ also comments upon [an
article](http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75275) about the
mistreatment of male Iraqi gynecologists:

> I'm having difficulty wrapping my mind around this … I mean, the thinking
> behind what's going on here. On the one hand, gynecologists are being
> threatened and murdered in Iraq for supposedly violating the sanctity of
> Muslim women; and on the other hand, they are being murdered for not
> circumcizing girls. Somehow, to the militants, preventive medicine and
> health care are violations of Muslim females, but cutting off part of their
> genitalia is not. How does that work exactly unless it's about really hating
> women?

On the _Regular Comments Based on Issues Raised by BBC World Have Your Say_
blog, [Abdelilah](http://abdoukili4.blogspot.com/2007/11/crime-and-
punishment.html) discusses the discrepancy between punishments for rape in
Saudi Arabia and the United States:

> In Saudi Arabia there was a strange incident in which woman who was a gang-
> rape victim who was sentenced to 200 lashes and six-months in jail. Seven
> men from the majority Sunni community were found guilty of the rape and
> sentenced to prison terms ranging from just under a year to five years.
> While a rapist is prosecuted and the victim is compensated, here we have the
> case of both parties subjected to punishment. This is worse than punishing a
> person simply on intent. At least the would-be victim will be spared being
> hurt by the aggressor and “disciplined” by the law.
>
> To make a comparison, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was sentenced
> to six year imprisonment, of which he served three years for rape, although
> the victim was with him in his hotel room at 02:00 a.m. So in Saudi Arabia,
> instead of the young women being fairly treated and receiving counselling,
> she is thrown in prison as a criminal.

Finally, and a bit more lighthearted, is a post by [_A Moro in
America_](http://adilski.blogspot.com/2007/11/moroccan-americans-discuss-
marriage.html) regarding a discussion on popular Moroccan-American site
[Wafin](http://www.wafin.com/) about the Moroccan male desire to marry a
younger woman. Adil quotes a bit of the discussion, sharing his own comments.
Here is a selection:

> A female by the screen name of _Lamiaafikri_ lashes out at the “male
> supremacy and ignorance” :

> “Posted By: lamiaafikri

> I can't help but notice that in almost every ad. about trying to find the

> gives you guys that right?, and what's the reasoning if any behind it? well
> beside arrogance, ignorance and male supremacy???  
>  I am yet to hear a smart, selfless ,convincing answer from either a man or
> a woman.Please, try to really think about it! thanks”

> A male reader got technical on _Lamiaafikri_ and started talking about
