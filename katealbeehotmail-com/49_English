A group of Filipino professors, scholars, and students in the Philippines is
leading a campaign against government steps to [remove the mandatory teaching
of Filipino](https://www.bworldonline.com/sc-upholding-ched-order-excluding-
filipino-from-curriculum-slammed/) language and Panitikan (literature) at the
college level.

Along with English,
[Filipino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_language) is one of the two
official languages in the Philippines, where [over 185 are
spoken](http://www.ethnologue.com/country/PH). It is the country's national
language and main lingua franca.

On October 9, 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the [Commission
on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order 13 of
2013](https://ched.gov.ph/blog/2018/11/13/ched-on-the-supreme-court-decision-
on-the-removal-of-filipino-from-the-new-general-education-curriculum/) which
officially removes Filipino and Philippine literature from the General
Education curriculum in colleges and universities. The SC decision overturns a
[temporary restraining order](https://www.rappler.com/nation/90733-sc-tro-new-
ge-curriculum) secured in 2015 by opponents of the CHED measure.

Basic education in the Philippines is composed of kindergarten (5-6 years
old), elementary (7-12 years old), high school (13-16 years old), and senior
high school (17-18 years old). This is followed by college level (19-22 years
old) at higher education institutions.

CHED justifies the curricular changes by reasoning that the said subjects are
already taught in the basic education curriculum. This comes amidst the
implementation of the K-12 program, which since 2011 have added two more years
of senior high school.

But [critics](http://pinoyweekly.org/new/2018/12/wikang-pambansa-vs-kolonyal-
na-edukasyon/) say the anti-Filipino curricular changes reinforce an
educational system inherited from the American colonial era that privileges
English and trains students for the foreign labor market. The erasure of
Filipino is seen as part of wider educational packages that marginalize the
humanities and other academic fields considered non-essential for the
formation of young Filipinos for the cheap labor needs of big business.

Various groups are leading protests and legal actions against the erasure of
Filipino and Panitikan in college. [Tanggol
Wika](http://bulatlat.com/main/2014/06/25/educators-students-form-alliance-to-
defend-filipino-language-subject/) (Defend our language), an alliance of
professors, students, writers, and cultural workers has [filed a motion for
reconsideration](http://bulatlat.com/main/2018/11/28/advocates-of-filipino-
and-literature-assert-retain-filipino-and-literature-in-college/) at the high
court last November 26, 2018. They warn that [10,000 teachers could end up
losing their
jobs](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/11/17/1869300/10000-teachers-
may-lose-jobs-due-removal-filipino-panitikan) due to the curricular changes.

Filipino advocates are encouraging netizens to post statements in support of
the preservation of Filipino in college using the hashtag
[#TanggolWikaAtBayan](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23tanggolwikaatbayan&src=typd)
(Defend our language and nation).

A [statement](https://upd.edu.ph/panatilihin-at-pagyamanin-ang-wikang-
filipino-at-panitikan-sa-kolehiyo-pahayag-ng-up-diliman-university-council/)
by the University of the Philippines Diliman University Council calls for the
preservation and development of Filipino and Panitikan in college:

> Naniniwala kami na napakahalaga ng wikang Filipino at panitikan sa
> pagpapalalim ng mapanuri, malikhain, malaya, at mapagpalayang kakayahan ng
> mga mag-aaral at mamamayan, anuman ang kanilang kurso, disiplina at larangan
> ng pagpapakadalubhasa. Hindi pag-uulit ang pag-aaral ng wika at panitikan sa
> kolehiyo, bagkus ay pagpapalawig sa teorya, praktika, at silbi nito sa
> pamantasan, bansa, at buhay.

> We believe that Filipino language and literature is vital in deepening the
> critical, creative, free, and liberating capacities of students and people,
> whatever their courses, disciplines, and fields of expertise. The study of
> language and literature in college is no duplication but an expansion of
> theory, practice, and its usage in the university, the nation, and life.

An [online petition](https://www.change.org/p/makalikom-ng-suporta-para-
panatilihin-ang-mga-kurso-sa-filipino-at-panitikan-sa-
kolehiyo/w?source_location=psf_petitions) has also been recently initiated by
the national university's Department of Filipino and Philippine Literatures.
Here are some of the comments written by the online petitioners at change.org:

> Carol Marcelo: Wala nang magmamahal pa ng kanyang sariling wika kundi tayong
> mga Filipino rin kaya tayo rin ang nararapat na magpayaman nito sa
> pamamagitan nang patuloy na paggamit at pagkilala bilang ating kaluluwa na
> kabahagi na natin noon pa man.

> Carol Marcelo: No one would love her own language if not us Filipinos hence
> it is only right that we enrich this through active usage and recognition of
> its being our soul even from before.

> Rommel Rodriguez: Mahalaga ang patuloy na pag-aaral ng wikang FIlipino at
> panitikan ng Pilipinas hanggang kolehiyo sapagkat bahagi ito sa paghubog ng
> kamalayan makabayan at adhikaing Pilipino ng ating mga mag-aaral.

> Rommel Rodriguez: The continued teaching of the Filipino language and
> Philippine literature up to college is important because it is part of the
> molding of a nationalist consciousness and Filipino aspirations of our
> students.

Memes have also sprung online poking fun at CHED and the Duterte government
and calling for the preservation of Filipino and Panitikan in college:

Other nations’ own languages did not become a hindrance for them to become
progressive, hence we Filipinos should not think that the Filipino language
will become an obstruction to development.

I am an Ilokano and I like to write and read of the discourses of national
unity and liberation. Because it is understood by the majority, Filipino is
the most effective language to attain this.
