On March 19, 2018, wildlife conservationists [mourned the
death](https://twitter.com/Musvanhiri/status/977927506664873985) of a 45-year-
old northern white rhinoceros named
[Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan_\(rhinoceros\)), one of the last
three remaining northern white rhinos on earth, and the only surviving male.
Keepers at the [Ol Pejeta Conservancy](http://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/) in
Kenya, where Sudan lived, euthanized the ailing rhino to end his age-related
suffering.

With Sudan's passing, there are only two remaining northern white rhinos left
in the world — both female and part of Sudan's bloodline — daughter Najin and
granddaughter Fatu. Scientists now hope for the [continuation of the
species](https://thewire.in/the-sciences/ivf-posited-as-last-straw-to-save-
nearly-extinct-northern-white-rhino) via a [controversial and highly debated
in-vitro fertilization (IVF)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
africa-43468066) process.

[Researchers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04959-2) have already
produced successful [hybrid
embryos](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hybrid-rhino-
embryos-20180704-story.html) using unfertilized eggs harvested from closely-
related southern white rhino females, combined with the frozen sperm of
deceased northern white rhino males. For the first time, the resulting embryos
grew to the [blastocyst stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst) in
the lab, filling scientists with the hope of saving the northern white rhino
from extinction.

Now, with Najin and Fatu under 24-hour guard in Kenya to protect them from
poachers, scientists intend to harvest their eggs to create viable embryos
with Sudan's frozen sperm and then implant them into female southern white
rhinos (a closely related subspecies), to create the first “pure” IVF northern
white rhino calves.

At this point, however, the proposition is hypothetical: scientists have not
yet been granted permission to extract eggs for the experimental process, but
hope to[ receive clearance](https://mashable.com/2018/07/04/northern-white-
rhino-embryo/#MhOd5skmwkqu) from the Kenyan government before the end of 2018.

The complex and invasive IVF process has caused a great deal of debate. For
one, the technology is expensive — experts estimate that the cost could be as
high as $9 million USD — and some have [questioned the
practicality](https://thewire.in/the-sciences/ivf-posited-as-last-straw-to-
save-nearly-extinct-northern-white-rhino) of pouring such heavy financial
resources into saving a species that is already at the brink of extinction,
rather than using the money to protect existing healthy rhino populations:

The activist group [Save the Rhino](https://www.savetherhino.org/) penned a
[statement](https://www.savetherhino.org/thorny-issues/can-we-save-the-
northern-white-rhino/) on the controversial treatment:

> A practical concern for any future Northern white rhinos successfully bred
> through IVF is the question of where they would live. Much of the sub-
> species’ former range has lost rhinos in its entirety, with limited
> conservation programmes or expertise for managing a rhino population, and
> large-scale habitat loss. In any case, for rhino population to be
> genetically viable, a minimum of 20, unrelated ‘founder individuals’ are
> needed. Otherwise, a population becomes inbred and prone to genetic
> abnormalities – and fertility problems.

Northern white rhinos (a subspecies of the [white
rhino](https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino-info/rhino-species/white-rhinos/)),
used to roam parts of Uganda, Chad, Sudan, the Central African Republic, and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but they are now [extinct in the wild
](http://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/wildlife/rhinos/northern-white-
rhinos/)due to years of poaching and civil wars.

Overall, rhino numbers — regardless of species — have dropped dramatically in
recent years, primarily fueled by demand for their horns. In [some Asian
countries](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/species-fate-at-stake-
as-south-africa-considers-rhino-horn-trade/), people believe their horns can
treat fevers and heart disease. In other areas, the horns are thought to
symbolize wealth.

### Zimbabwe tries to clamp down on illegal rhino trade

While the IVF debate continues, Sudan's death has raised awareness of the
plight of rhinos throughout the African continent. Zimbabwe, for instance, is
home to both the [white rhino](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/white-
rhino) and [black rhino](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/black-rhino).
In a 2009 rhino population count, there were approximately 425 black rhinos
and 300 white rhinos roaming [Zimbabwean national
parks](http://zimparks.org/parks/national-parks/hwange/) and [private
conservancies](http://savevalleyconservancy.org).

In an effort to stop the illegal killing and exploitation of wild animals, the
Zimbabwean government has implemented legal protections for them, under
provisions set out in the [Parks & Wild Life Act [Chapter 20:14]
(PWA),](http://www.speakoutforanimals.org/sudanblog.html) which has strict
consequences for offenses. A rhino is now classified as a “specially protected
animal” — hunting and killing them is prohibited, and offenders face a
mandatory jail sentence of nine years on a first conviction, and 11 years on a
second.

Even with a stiff penalty in place, poachers are still willing to take the
risk but end up as [pawns in a complex
network](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/rhino_poaching) of
organized crime. Many are poor, unemployed villagers, lured by the lucrative
promise of poaching. Combating the illegal wildlife trade must (and often
doesn't) involve the arrests of those organizing it at the top.

The PWA demands
[forfeiture](https://defensewiki.ibj.org/index.php/Forfeiture_of_items_used_in_connection_with_crimes_\(Zimbabwe\))
of any equipment, vehicles or weapons used for committing wildlife offenses,
giving the state the right to confiscate and dispose of them as it sees fit —
but despite these legal protections, change is slow in coming, and limited by
a lack of adequate funding, lax law enforcement, and corruption.

A South African daily online newspaper, the [Daily
Maverick](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-11-28-home-grown-
corruption-is-killing-africas-rhinos-and-elephants/), reported that corruption
is linked to illegal rhino horn trade not just in Zimbabwe, but in eight other
African countries.

### Urgent call for rhino conservation

Conservationists are urging activists and everyday citizens — especially those
who reside in close proximity to the home ranges of wildlife — to take an
active stance on rhino conservation.

In Zimbabwe, where [62 percent of the
population](http://zimbabwe.unfpa.org/en/topics/young-people-2) is below the
age of 25, the hope is that youth will play a central role in this activism
thrust. However, as more young people spend increasing amounts of time online
rather than out in nature, activists must focus heavily on youth recruitment
in the fight to save rhinos.

As an [umbrella species,](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-an-
umbrella-species.html) rhinos are an integral part of a rich ecosystem whose
daily habits directly impact the quality of life for other species. Their
grazing, for instance, keeps the grass trim, making the terrain easier for
smaller mammals to navigate.

While scientists acknowledge that extinction is a natural part of evolution,
the process is occurring at a much faster rate because of poaching, [habitat
destruction](https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino-info/threats/habitat-loss/),
over-exploitation of wildlife, and even [political
conflict](https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino-info/threats/political-
conflict/). Rhino extinction will have a profound ripple effect on other
species, and Sudan's death is a glaring reminder.
