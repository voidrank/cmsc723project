Press freedom advocates are raising the issue of political interference in
Timor-Leste’s public television network after the unceremonious removal of the
network's president.

Gil Da Costa, chairperson of the board of directors of Timor-Leste Radio and
Television ([RTTL](http://rttlep.tl/en/)), was
[removed](http://www.pmc.aut.ac.nz/pacific-media-watch/timor-leste-sacked-
head-state-broadcaster-rttl-claims-political-axe-10276) from his position on 9
January 2019 following a controversial audit undertaken by the government. Da
Costa was subsequently replaced by Francisco da Silva, who led the audit.

The audit allegedly found some irregularities committed under the watch of Da
Costa. But Da Costa claimed he was sacked for political reasons, specifically
his refusal to allow political meddling in the editorial work of RTTL.

> There have been several attempts at political interference on me and
> directly on journalists to try to influence editorial content.
>
> As head of RTTL I always insisted that I wanted it to be an independent
> institution without political interference. And I’ve tried to do this. And
> there was a lot of political interference.

Another possible reason for his removal is that Da Costa was nominated by a
minority political party.

The Timor-Leste Press Council

statement condemning what it calls the [first political
interference](https://asiapacificreport.nz/2019/02/03/timor-leste-press-

the country’s restoration of independence in 2002. Virgílio Guterres,
president of the Press Council, also
[criticized](https://www.facebook.com/ConselhoImprensa/posts/1177721035710880?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDdXFQrM84KT6a-Cn2sesnihZeDiFKT-2BVFuLVfYatMHNS2R8TbOUd51voxpfEJzzrOf8mFlNt9yhF9aar3SW0FFANWYbeTSmGOfYj8AeuIaGEyX1pEgC-

a government official for entering the RTTL newsroom and
[intimidating](https://asiapacificreport.nz/2019/02/03/timor-leste-press-
council-condemns-crime-against-public-broadcaster/) journalists:

> It is a crime against journalism as these people have seized the power of
> the editor-in-chief for exercising their political interests.
>
> The Press Council is concerned about this situation, and would like to take
> the opportunity to convey our concerns to the public as well also to the
> government bodies to look into this situation.

In response to the Press Council's concerns, the new head of RTTL acknowledged
receiving the complaints and vowed to make’ self-improvements’.

on Facebook about the issue of political interference in the media. His post,
written in Portuguese, was [translated](http://www.pmc.aut.ac.nz/pacific-

> Journalists are not just microphones that reproduce, without any

> Ensuring the independence of public media is even more important.
> Interference in newsrooms is unacceptable and should always be tackled.
> Whoever does this is weakening the quality of the Timorese state.

Since its independence from Indonesia in 2002, local media outlets
[flourished](https://ojs.aut.ac.nz/pacific-journalism-
review/article/view/448/617) in Timor-Leste thanks in part to international
aid. No journalist has been jailed in Timor-Leste according to Reporters
Without Borders but there is [concern](https://rsf.org/en/east-timor) that
political pressure is forcing some media companies to practice self-
censorship.
