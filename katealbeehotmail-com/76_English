In 2015, Rwandan president Paul Kagame oversaw [constitutional
reforms](https://qz.com/577447/rwanda-is-about-to-vote-in-changes-that-would-
allow-its-president-to-govern-for-17-more-years/) allowing him to run for a
[third term in office](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35209186),
effectively ensuring his role as president until 2034. Under Kagame's
leadership, Rwanda has transformed itself from a haunted nation with a
genocidal past to one of modernity and development.

However, Rwanda's notable transformation has come with the high price of
sustained repression of human rights and freedom of expression. A 2017 report
by [Human Rights Watch on Rwanda](https://www.hrw.org/world-
report/2018/country-chapters/rwanda) reveals an abysmal pattern of
debilitating free speech and political pluralism along with extrajudicial
executions, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture of citizens.

Two women who both challenged Kagame as opposition candidates in presidential
elections, Victorie Ingabire and Diane Rwigara, are now in prison for what
many say are trumped-up charges to silence opposition voices:

### Victoire Ingabire

Victoire Ingabire returned to Rwanda from the Netherlands (where she resided
for 16 years) in January 2010 to contend in the 2010 presidential elections.

That same year, Ingabire served as the President of the United Democratic
Forces (FDU-Inkingi) in Rwanda.

Her crime, according to [Friends of Victoire,
](https://www.friendsofvictoire.org/about-victoire/victoire-ingabires-
trial/)began with her speech in Kigali's Genocide Memorial Centre:

> On 16 January 2010, her first day in the country after 16 years abroad, she
> made a speech at the Genocide Memorial Centre in the capital, Kigali, and
> laid a remembrance wreath. Her speech, which referred to problems with
> reconciliation and ethnic violence, addressed issues that are rarely
> discussed openly in Rwanda. Victoire Ingabire was arrested in April 2010.
> She was bailed on house arrest and prevented from leaving Kigali. She was
> subsequently re-arrested on 14 October 2010 and was remanded in pre-trial
> detention.

Between 1994-1995, Rwanda suffered a genocide during which ethnic Hutu and
Tutsi people engaged in mass slaughtering, spurred on by Hutu nationalists.
Nearly [800,000 mostly Tutsi people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-
africa-26875506) were slaughtered within a year's time. The
[Twa](https://minorityrights.org/minorities/twa-2/) people, an indigenous
community, also lost nearly a third of its population.

As a result of the genocide, nearly two million Rwandans, mostly ethnic Hutu,
[fled](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26946982) to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) seeking refuge from the violence. Kagame's
[invasion](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-11105289) into the DRC with
the Tutsi-led Rwandan Defense Forces prompted atrocities mostly targeting
thousands of ethnic Hutu.

Rwanda has enacted a number of [laws
proscribing](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1172&context=njihr)
“genocide ideology”, “genocide minimisation” and “negationism,” but [Amnesty
International](http://www.veritasinfo.fr/article-rwanda-s-law-on-repressing-
the-crime-of-genocide-crimes-against-humanity-and-war-crimes-is-
legall-75796343.html) asserts that these are “vague laws that pose unnecessary
restrictions on people’s freedom of expression.”

When Ingabire, an ethnic Hutu, asked why there was no memorial for the
moderate Hutus also killed in the genocide, stating “[her brother was one of
them,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/rwanda/7900680/Paul-
Kagame-Rwandas-redeemer-or-ruthless-dictator.html)” she was perceived as a
“genocide denier” and was subsequently barred from running in the 2010
presidential elections. In 2013, the Rwandan Supreme Court handed her a
fifteen-year jail term for:

> …threatening state security and ‘belittling’ the 1994 genocide. The Supreme
> Court also [pronounced her guilty](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-
> africa-25371874) of spreading rumors intended to incite people to revolt —
> charges on which she had earlier been cleared.

On November 24, 2017, the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights (AfCHPR)
[ruled](https://www.friendsofvictoire.org/african-court-rules-in-favour-of-
prisoner-victoire-ingabire-umuhoza/) that Rwanda violated Victoire Ingabire's
right to freedom of opinion and expression, as well as her right to an
adequate defense. The court maintained that the state
[violated](https://medium.com/@JudiRever/african-court-rules-in-favour-of-
rwandan-political-prison-victoire-ingabire-995ae620681e) various aspects of
her rights:

> Ingabire’s right to various aspects of her defense and to freely express her
> opinions within the law. The judges found that Ingabire had not minimized
> the genocide against Tutsis and had not spread false rumors about the
> government, charges that were central to Ingabire’s conviction by Rwandan
> courts.

### Diane Rwigara

Rwandan businesswoman Diane Shima Rwigara ran as an independent candidate in
the 2017 Rwandan presidential elections. Her father, Assinapol Rwigara, was a
major financier of Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front in the 1990s, and in 2015,
he was killed in what his daughter[
described](https://allafrica.com/stories/201705090078.html) as an
assassination. Police claim he died in a car crash.

Rwigara's decision to run against Kagame was lauded as ‘[shattering a glass
ceiling’](https://allafrica.com/stories/201705080108.html). However, she was
soon slandered with the release of [nude
pictures](https://allafrica.com/stories/201705130071.html) shared on social
media. Rwigara stated that these images were fabricated to
[silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/04/africa/rwanda-election-nude-
photos-candidate/index.html) her.

The Rwandan Electoral Commission delivered the last blow to her ambition with
disqualification papers, [accusing](https://www.voanews.com/a/three-rwandan-
presidential-candidates-disqualified/3933118.html) Rwigara of doctoring the
required number of signatures needed to run against Kagame in the elections.
She was further accused of submitting names of the deceased, which she denied.

In an op-ed published in [The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/08/02/what-
happened-when-i-tried-to-run-to-become-rwandas-first-female-
president/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7d27be838983), Rwigara asserts:

> ![](https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Diane-Shima-
> Rwigara.jpg)
>
> Screen shot of Diane Shima Rwigara, Rwandan opposition candidate, whose
> arrest sparked the hashtag #FreeDianeRwigara
>
> It’s no longer news that I have been disqualified as a candidate in Rwanda’s
> presidential election. Unfortunately, Rwandans will not see my name on their
> polling cards when they go to vote on Aug. 4. President Paul Kagame will
> eventually be crowned as an undisputed king of Rwanda and will continue to
> rule the country in a climate of fear and lack of fundamental freedoms. By
> extending his 23 years in power, Kagame is denying Rwandans an opportunity
> to experience the first-ever peaceful transition of power in their country.

Rwigara was arrested last year on charges of “[incitement and
fraud”](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/28/africa/hfr-rwanda-diane-rwigara-
asequals-
intl/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNNi&utm_content=2018-08-28T15%3A55%3A01&utm_term=link)
and sent to prison for 20 years. Her assets were forcefully confiscated and
[auctioned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44521197) by Kagame. Members
of her family were also sent to jail for [tax
evasion](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/rwandan-police-arrest-diane-
rwigara-family-members-170904192211566.html) and several of her supporters

Rwandans have experienced sustained economic growth of about eight percent
between 2001-2014, according to the [World Economic
Forum.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/5-things-to-know-about-rwanda-
s-economy/) The percentage of Rwandans living below the poverty line has
fallen from 57 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2010. And Kagame has
positioned Rwanda as the [world's leader in
terms](http://www.africanews.com/2017/07/10/rwanda-tops-un-list-of-countries-
with-most-women-in-parliament//) of the highest number of women in parliament.

However, [ReportsAfrique](https://reportsafrique.com/africa/rwanda/paul-
kagames-bad-handling-of-critic-diane-rwigara-may-stain-his-good-record/)
argues that Kagame's “high handedness against political opponents may
undermine that seeming good name that he has built for himself.”

Kagame's [authoritarian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/paul-
kagame-rwanda-success-authoritarian) side is [cleverly
concealed](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/07/what-rwandas-tourists-do-not-
see) from tourists and international aid donors. Running a well-oiled [public
relations machinery,](https://gahunde.org/2016/01/29/learn-how-rwanda-under-

as Rwanda's [benevolent dictator](http://cincinnatirepublic.com/rwandas-
benevolent-dictator/).
