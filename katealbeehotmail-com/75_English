A screengrab of an official photo from Jamaica's Ministry of Culture, Gender,
Entertainment and Sport, capturing the unveiling of the statue honouring poet
Louise Bennett-Coverley, posted on Twitter by Robert Nesta Morgan. Present at
the ceremony were Prime Minister Andrew Holness and his wife, who is the
Member of Parliament for the area, as well as Miss Lou's son.

Gordon Town, small, picturesque, and unpretentious, is nestled on [the Hope
River](https://adventuresfromelle.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/gordon-town-falls/)
just outside Kingston, tucked between steeply sloping foothills. Travellers,
who often pass through the town square on their way to the Blue Mountains, now
have a reason to stop and take a look: Gordon Town was also the home of Louise
Bennett-Coverley — fondly called “Miss Lou” — poet, folklorist, comedian, and
above all, defender of the Jamaican language. On September 7, 2018, on what
would have been her 99th birthday, residents, cultural activists, and
government officials alike [were
proud](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/-miss-lou-statue-excites-gordon-
town-residents_143740?profile=1373) to witness the unveiling of a statue in
her honour in the town square.

Unlike [other depictions](https://globalvoices.org/2017/06/30/slimmed-down-
garvey-sculpture-gets-thumbs-down-from-jamaicans/) of respected national
figures, the statue [won the
approval](https://twitter.com/suraze/status/1038523461273092096) of the
Jamaican public; there are now plans to build a small museum and rename the
square Miss Lou Square.

Diaspora writer Geoffrey Philp tweeted his reaction to the statue in Jamaican
Patois:

> Now das wha statue fi look like! Not no likkle fenke fenke mash mouth smaddy
> whe look like dem couldn’ mash ants

While government officials waxed lyrical about the unveiling of the statue on
social media, university researcher Deborah Gordon Hickling [asked
about](https://www.facebook.com/deborah.hickling.9/posts/10155812761316903)
the availability of [Bennett-Coverley's
work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7htbzK69iA&feature=youtu.be) locally,
even though a [Deed of Gift was
signed](https://mcges.gov.jm/index.php/component/k2/item/322-historic-signing-
with-louise-bennett-coverley-estate-grange) earlier in the week, handing over
a collection of her work to the National Library of Jamaica:

> I gotta ask, where in Jamaica has her work been curated in a place that
> Jamaicans can readily walk into and see and hear everything Miss Lou? Where
> can the documentary testament to her life’s work be seen? […] Where are
> audio tapes, the interviews to be publicly heard and celebrated? In Canada,
> McMaster University has a room of her work. Where can we see curated work
> about her groundbreaking, foundational, identity-forming work in Jamaica
> Welfare? Her social interventions that built pride and awareness of who we
> are.

Miss Lou always was much more than a lovable exponent of Jamaican culture. Her
cheerful personality and comedic performances belied the serious intent of her
work, which was to [promote and popularise Jamaican Patois](http://jamaica-
gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20160726/miss-lou-lauded-use-jamaican-
creole), a language that had been scorned throughout the colonial era:

> Louise Bennett-Coverley (7 September 1919 – 26 July 2006) Jamaican poet,
> folklorist, and educator, born 99 years ago today. She wrote and performed
> her poems and folk songs in patois, preserving and popularising our nation's
> language. Miss Lou paved the way for all who came after.

Bennett-Coverley emerged at a time when it was particularly important for
Jamaica to establish its national identity; however, more than fifty years
after Jamaica's independence from Great Britain, Jamaica is still
[reluctant](https://twitter.com/selectaprincess/status/1036218716470558721) to
fully embrace Patois. Broadcaster and educator Fae Ellington, a lively
exponent of the language, recorded her thoughts on Miss Lou's birthday on both
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/207wQEu3AIs) and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FaeAEllington/posts/2032586523698290):

In Jamaican parlance, Miss Lou was skilled in the Jamaican art of “tek serious
ting mek joke” — creating humour in a serious situation. As writer Claude
Mills [put it](http://louisebennett.com/wp-content/uploads/Miss-Lou-97.pdf):

> Underneath her wily […] comedic style, she forced the society to face
> unpleasant truths about itself through the multi-hued, multiracial colours
> in her verbal palette. But it is the bold, proud, unapologetic championing
> of the use of the Jamaican language internationally that so endeared her to
> many Jamaicans.

But Bennett-Coverley was not dogmatic in her approach. In a [2016
presentation](https://nlj.gov.jm/2016/11/18/miss-lou-matters-presentation-
professor-mervyn-morris-poet-laureate-jamaica-launch-miss-lou-archives-
thursday-oct-20-2016-nlj/) at the National Library, Professor Mervyn Morris
pointed out:

> Miss Lou was trying to redress cultural imbalance by enhancing respect for
> Creole. She did not favour ‘so-so English’ [‘only English’]. […] She did not
> hesitate to speak and write in English as well as in Jamaican Creole. She
> was comfortable in both.

Miss Lou's work resonated far beyond Jamaican shores. One of her best-known
poems, [“Colonisation in
Reverse”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgTnt2olWzs), was a wry commentary
on the influx of Caribbean immigrants to the United Kingdom in the 1950s and
'60s. A member of the diaspora herself, Bennett-Coverley introduced Canada —
where she lived for a number of years — to Jamaican Patois, and [her influence
in her adopted country was
considerable](http://www.etfo.ca/AboutETFO/MediaRoom/MediaReleases/Pages/Toronto%20teacher%20and%20author%20Nadia%20Hohn%20wins%20ETFO%20Writers%20Award.aspx).

Miss Lou has received numerous honours and
[awards](https://twitter.com/GLNRArchives/status/1038093264807780357), of
which the statue in Gordon Town is the latest tribute. However, some Jamaicans
[believe](https://twitter.com/marciaforbes/status/1038872654969806849) this is
not nearly enough to honour her. Cultural activist Professor Carolyn Cooper is
among those who believe Miss Lou should be made a national hero. During [a
heated debate last year](https://globalvoices.org/2017/07/16/jamaican-
dancehall-stars-instagram-diss-of-cultural-icon-sparks-war-of-words/), sparked
by a young dancehall star's comments that were widely perceived to disrespect
Miss Lou's legacy, she [observed](http://jamaica-
gleaner.com/article/commentary/20170723/carolyn-cooper-i-have-tablecloth-
dress):

> Louise Bennett's mission was essentially about black power. She said, ‘When
> I was a child, nearly everything about us was bad, yuh know; they would tell
> yuh seh yuh have bad hair, that black people bad, and that the language yuh
> talk was bad. And I know that a lot of people I knew were not bad at all —
> they were nice people and they talked this language.’
>
> The lasting insult to Miss Lou is […] our continuing refusal to acknowledge
> the power of our Jamaican language. At home and in school! The Ministry of
> Education must ensure that every child is able to learn in his or her home
> language. It's a human right. That's one of the ways in which we will
> continue to honour Louise Bennett for generations to come. And while we're
> at it, we should just officially recognise the fact that Miss Lou is a
> national heroine.

Whether Miss Lou does acquire official status, or is simply regarded as a
cultural legend, it appears that Jamaicans are acquiring a deeper appreciation
of the significance of her work and the importance of language as the most
fundamental expression of culture.
