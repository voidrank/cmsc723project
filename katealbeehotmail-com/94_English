Student protests in Poland have succeeded in delaying a bill that opponents
say could threaten the autonomy of universities.

Known as [Bill 2.0](https://www.biuletyn.pw.edu.pl/Ustawa-2.0), the act
includes proposals to reduce funding and research opportunities for regional
universities, and aims to diminish the control held by the University Senate ‚Äî
a body of students, academics and other university employees who organise the
day-to-day running of the institution‚Äì in favor of a University Council,
consisting of individuals from outside universities.

[Another clause](http://politicalcritique.org/cee/poland/2018/polish-reform-
higher-education-gowin-protest/), recently added, requires female researchers
employed at academic institutions to retire from their careers at the age of
60, five years before their male colleagues.

Poland's ruling right-wing nationalist party, Law and Justice, has increased
governmental control over many facets of society since it took power in 2015.
Critics feared this draft law was another glimpse of authoritarianism.

For almost two weeks, fences, balconies and walls in universities across the
country were peppered with handmade banners, painted cardboard and fluttering
pamphlets, as students occupied spaces and voiced their disapproval of the
planned reforms. The protests marked the first nationwide occupation strike of
students since 1989.

### On a Warsaw balcony, a movement is born

The bill is being pushed by Jaros≈Çaw Gowin, Minister of Science and Higher
Education. Earlier this month, after [over 100
amendments](http://www.rp.pl/Edukacja/306149905-Ustawa-o-szkolnictwie-wyzszym-
Nowe-propozycje-dla-uczelni.html) by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, it was
sent for a second reading in the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish
parliament.

The assumption was that it would come into force around October 2018. This was
not to be the case.

The first protest against it was announced on Facebook, a [5 June event titled
‚ÄúWolne Dni Akademii‚Äù](https://www.facebook.com/events/2167360196877426/)
(‚ÄúFree Academic Days‚Äù). Students from the University of Warsaw occupied the
Kazimierz Palace balcony, which juts over the fashionable Krakowskie
Przedmie≈õcie street.

Under the slogan ‚Äú[Nauka Niepodleg≈Ça](http://naukaniepodlegla.pl/)‚Äù
(‚ÄúIndependent Learning‚Äù), resistance grew. Participants hosted panels and
events, gaining the support of institutions from Poland and abroad.

As some politicians, like possible presidential candidate Robert Biedro≈Ñ,
flocked to Twitter to congratulate the students, others physically supported
the protests, bringing food and sleeping bags.

Pictures circulating online depict make-do tents erected in the center of the
balcony, with students propped up against the balustrades surrounded by cups
of coffee or boxes of produce.

Meanwhile, supporters of the draft law or of the [Law and Justice
party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice) tried to discredit the
protesters, suggesting their actions were foolhardy and not representative of
the majority.

### The protests spread

Students in Warsaw remained on the balcony for 10 days, until work on the
measure was postponed. In that time, however, they were far from being the
only ones mobilising.

At institutions across the country, students and their supporters young and
old [held marches and discussions](http://naukaniepodlegla.pl/) and hung
banners against the draft law. One poster asked quite simply, [‚ÄúWhat is Gowin
on?‚Äù](https://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/spoleczenstwo/1752600,1,what-
is-gowin-on--pytaja-ministra-nauki-studenci-i-akademicy-w-calej-polsce.read)

Students also occupied university spaces. [On 9
June](https://oko.press/studenci-wstali-z-kolan-okupuja-uczelnie-w-calej-
polsce-strajkuja-przeciw-ustawie-gowina/), at the AGH University of Science
and Technology in Krakow, a struggle ensued when a doorman entered a room
occupied by students, claiming that they had pretended to be lecturers to gain
access and demanding the return of the key to the room. The students complied
with his demand, but refused to leave.

The protest group based there posted [on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AkademickiProtestKrakow/photos/a.287284965346027.1073741829.287097728698084/291628308245026/?type=3&theater)
three days later, saying they had recently been threatened by police who
believed they wanted to ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù to university buildings. [Another post
later](https://www.facebook.com/AkademickiProtestKrakow/posts/292364728171384)
explained that they were organising around issues that go beyond the draft
law:

> W trakcie debat i wyk≈Çad√≥w prowadzonych w trakcie Strajku Okupacyjnego
> poruszono znacznie wiƒôcej kwestii ni≈º tylko te wynikajƒÖce z projektu reformy
> polskich uczelni wy≈ºszych. W ten spos√≥b wyra≈ºamy sprzeciw nie tylko wobec
> ustawy 2.0, ale r√≥wnie≈º obecnego kszta≈Çtu Uniwersytetu, jako przestrzeni
> niedemokratycznej, wewnƒôtrznie podzielonej i hierarchicznej.

> During the debates and lectures conducted during the occupation strike, much
> more issues were raised than just the reforms of Polish universities. In
> this way, we express our opposition not only to the Bill 2.0, but also to
> the current shape of the university as an undemocratic, internally divided
> and hierarchical space.

In Pozna≈Ñ, [protests began on 12
June](http://www.polskatimes.pl/edukacja/a/uam-poznan-protest-studentow-
okupuja-rektorat-przeciw-reformie-gowina-zdjecia-wideo,13253114/), with
students occupying the Rectorate. Here they remained adamant that their
quarrel was not with the rector or university authorities, discouraging
disruption of the rector‚Äôs work by ensuring only 20 people were on active
protest during the day, and seven at night.

After the Polish parliament [postponed the vote until
July](http://www.rp.pl/Edukacja/306149905-Ustawa-o-szkolnictwie-wyzszym-Nowe-
propozycje-dla-uczelni.html), with the ministry claiming it would submit a
changed proposal, students across the country ended their protests.

### The protest ‚Äúdoes not mean that higher education does not need reforms‚Äù

Throughout, Minister Gowin remained adamant that the act would improve
university education ‚Äì according to the [newspaper
Wiadomo≈õci](https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/gowin-odpowiada-protestujacym-studentom-
nie-rozumiem-tych-zarzutow-6259847068645505a), he claimed he did not
understand the protests, explaining that he had consulted ‚Äúall academic
groups‚Äù about the bill over the last years.

However, one anonymous participant of the protest in Warsaw told [OkoPress
](https://oko.press/studenci-wstali-z-kolan-okupuja-uczelnie-w-calej-polsce-
strajkuja-przeciw-ustawie-gowina/)that students decided to react because ‚Äúthe
consultations were conducted only with people supporting the law.‚Äù

Another, Mateusz Burzawa, who sang in the revolutionary choir during the
Krak√≥w protests, hinted to Global Voices that issues with the bill were
founded in Gowin's own attitude:

> [The protest] does not mean that higher education does not need reforms, and
> how that everything in this bill is bad, only [that] the faith of the
> minister that ‚Äúthe market will solve all problems‚Äù is an ideological
> approach.

Not all students thought the protests were the right approach. [On
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/czechowicz.nowoczesna/photos/a.410323649434895.1073741828.402966760170584/422644544869472/?type=3&theater),
Kacper Aleksander Czechowicz dubbed the action at the University of Warsaw a
‚Äúfarce,‚Äù suggesting that the organisers had sabotaged the work of the Student
Parliament. Appointed representatives to the [Student
Parliament](https://www.esu-online.org/?member=poland-psrp) in Poland are
equal partners to negotiations on the national level, with aims to lobby for
student rights through representing the student body in negotiations with the
government.

But graphic designer and activist Dawid Czajkowski countered in a separate
[post](https://www.facebook.com/dawid.czajkowski/posts/10217205270869938) that
the Student Parliament does not stick up for students as it should (in his
words: it is ‚Äúas soft as butter on a hot day‚Äù).

This why he used his company, Posters Involved, to support the students, whom
he thinks are the most threatened by the draft law. Czajkowski's protest
posters included a representation of a vulnerable white block, painted red
with the word ‚ÄúAutonomia‚Äù (‚ÄòAutonomy‚Äô), and a disembodied saw emblazoned with
‚ÄúGowin 2.0‚Ä≥ slicing through its middle.

He told Global Voices:

> The new law on higher education centralises responsibility at universities
> and withdraws autonomy from individual faculties‚Ä¶In addition, smaller
> Universities are marginalized in favor of the larger ones. This means that
> you can only make up oneself in a few centers in the country, which is an
> obvious possibility to control doctoral students, their future, etc.

In the meantime, the Academic Protest Committee, which organised the original
demonstrations, plans to host a congress to bring together all of the protests
groups from around the country to decide the next course of action.

The fight is not over yet.
