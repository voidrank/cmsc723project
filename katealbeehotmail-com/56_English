In the midst of Guyana's lush rainforests, nestled between the [Rupununi
River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupununi) and Brazilian border, dwells
the Indigenous [Wapishana tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapishana).
Linguist and cultural activist Adrian Gomes hails from an isolated Wapishana
village, yet, he speaks less Wapishana — an Indigenous Arawakan language
spoken in Guyana and Brazil —than English.

Now, he's trying to revive the dying language.

According to the [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization](https://en.unesco.org/), more than 40 percent of the world’s
languages are endangered. In 1997, concerned about the dwindling number of
Wapishana-literate adults, Gomes formed the Wapichan Wadauniinao Ati’o (WWA,
meaning “Wapishana for our Descendants”), to help revive the Wapishana
language.

In 2011, the WWA embarked on a four-year Wapishana Adult Literacy Programme to
preserve the community's language, culture and land resources, in keeping with
the [United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples)
recommendations. Gomes says that by preserving endangered languages, people
access their stories in their own tongue, thereby retaining strong roots.

Language is about communication — but it's also an instrument of knowledge and
power.

Gomes maintains:

> In our part of the world of formerly colonised countries, ‘true
> decolonisation’ is still lacking, for there is still the continuation of
> colonial structures and mentalities in the context of the independent
> nations.

Global Voices corresponded with Gomes via email about his vision for the
Wapishana language.

**Global Voices (GV): What inspired you to want to preserve this language and
how do you see it making a difference?**

> **Adrian Gomes (AD):** I realised that I did not know my own cultural
> heritage or background very well, despite being able to speak the language.
> It’s not that the knowledge was hidden, but due to my exposure to mainstream
> culture, I had not been actively involved in the activities of _my_ culture.
> I missed out on a lot on trips to the deep forest and the wide-ranging
> savannah … and the practical lessons passed on by our elders through on-the-
> spot occurrences … I felt incomplete when it came to knowing my roots — I
> missed a sense of belonging — of being Wapishana. I wanted to do something
> about it.
>
> Guyana's 9,000-strong Wapishana population was no longer equivalent to the
> number of speakers (around 5,000 or less). As people favoured the national
> language, English, as well as Creole and even Portuguese, our Indigenous
> language was no longer being passed on to the next generation. There is a
> growing number of young adults who speak only English.
>
> The WWA's literacy programme has revitalised the language in 17 villages in
> south Rupununi by increasing literacy at the grassroots level. This … gave
> people a sense of pride and expanded their self-esteem. There are now
> approximately 1,000 Wapishana-literate people.

**GV: What other activities does the WWA undertake?**

> **AG:** At the WWA centre, we archive language data, strengthen the capacity
> of local WWA tutors to train others, promote the language through reading
> and spelling competitions, and collaborate with like-minded partners. People
> have even been inspired to produce their own reading materials. The WWA is
> recognised as the local authority for the translation of certain documents,
> and we have got approval from the Ministry of Education for a
> Wapishana/English pilot project in three villages …

**GV: What have been some of the challenges?**

> **AG:** Through the literacy courses, we have managed to preserve the
> language to a large extent; However, participation dwindled toward the end
> of the four-year programme. Part of the struggle was that we also needed a
> more advanced level programme. A considerable number of youth were not
> motivated enough to participate … English tends to be promoted, celebrated
> and exalted at the expense of native languages, which are seen as old
> fashioned.
>
> The WWA has to create programmes that span generations … [to] ‘create space’
> for the Wapishana language in modern technology …

**GV: Do technological tools benefit language preservation?**

> **AG:** Digital media and technology have helped in archiving materials … at
> the disposal of younger Wapishana who want to get connected with their
> cultural heritage. The community radio station facilitates programmes and
> songs in Wapishana, as well as storytelling and literacy lessons. It sends
> the message that our Indigenous language is affirmed and valued.
>
> In principle, there is no reason why we cannot have access to digital tools
> such as WhatsApp or Facebook. Like the [Wayana
> community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayana_language) in Suriname, we
> can use the Wapishana language to send messages to one another via these
> networking platforms to increase our reach.

**GV: How do you attract learners?**

> **AG:** By incorporating Wapishana reading and writing into friendly
> competitions at the district and regional levels of the annual Indigenous
> Heritage celebrations, we promote the idea that language literacy can be
> fun. And by translating Wapishana stories into English, we have paved the
> way for the possibility of the production of bilingual (diglot) booklets …
> We're trying to design a special introductory course at the University of
> Guyana for non-Wapishana speaking students. My work at Leiden University has
> enabled me to build a network with other Indigenous scholars working on new
> methodologies …
>
> The Ministry of Culture had asked for English translations of a number of
> our Wapishana stories … The Amerindian Research Unit of the University of
> Guyana also approached us regarding an introductory course on the Wapishana
> language. I am regularly asked to give guest lectures and seminars there,
> and train students to embrace new methodologies in working with Indigenous
> peoples [at Leiden University].

**GV: Have there been any efforts to integrate non-Wapishana speakers with
those who _do_ speak the language?**

> **AG:** … [T]wo leaders of the Macushi, another Indigenous group, asked us
> to share our experiences to help them start their own local language
> literacy programmes. So, while the languages are distinctly different,
> groups might benefit from working on common strategies to teach our
> languages to our own peoples and also to non-Indigenous groups.
>
> … Well-planned multilingual education places value on the national
> community. Being aware of differences does not equate to feeling estranged
> from those who are different; bilingual education can increase pride in
> diversity and strengthen national unity. If we weaken Indigenous culture, we
> weaken an integral part of Guyanese culture.

**GV: Does the remoteness of the Rupununi restrict your efforts?**

> **AG:** One of the main constraints is a lack of internet access and
> telecommunications in most villages, including
> [Maruranau](https://moipa.gov.gy/indigenous-villages/maruranau/), where the
> WWA centre is located. We are still waiting for mobile internet. An
> unreliable postal system in the Rupununi also hinders communication and
> prevents timely access to information.

**GV: What do you make of linguist Noam Chomsky's theory that children only
need to learn certain parochial features of their native language?**

> **AG:** A similar view that places less importance on Indigenous language
> was revealed by [Lightbown and Spada](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ657542), who
> noted that most teachers working in Inuit Indigenous communities believed
> that the mother tongue is important mainly for use outside of school. This
> suggests that it’s not important _in_ school and that for language
> preservation, external use of it would suffice …There can be just as much
> lack of understanding with Wapishana parents and teachers; in fact, some are
> opposed to the bilingual pilot programme.
>
> In addressing this, I share the academic, cognitive and social benefits
> children have as a result of being literate both in their native and
> majority languages. Past bilingual education efforts in Wapishana
> communities have shown a significant improvement in children’s performance.
> With a more sustained programme, we can expect even greater levels of
> achievement.

**GV: Any plans for new projects?**

> **AG:** … Guyana will host an interpreting and translation workshop in the
> early part of next year, which other Indigenous organisations in both Guyana
> and Suriname have already signalled their interest in attending. We feel
> good about expanding our network; bringing communities with similar
> challenges together to look for solutions.
