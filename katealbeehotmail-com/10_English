Soft pop music is playing as the wind rustles through the outdoor patio,
carrying the rich aromas of Indian spices and sizzling hot curries. A tall,
dark-skinned man dressed in Western clothes, walks out of the kitchen carrying
a tray of buttery naan and steaming jasmine rice.

When Queentrus Dominic, known as Quinn, moved to Khon Kaen in northeast
Thailand in 2010, he thought he was the only South Asian not just in the city
but in the entire region. Deprived of his Sri Lankan home cuisine and a
businessman at heart, he opened Quinn’s One and Only, an Indian restaurant, in
2018.

Quickly, he found that he was far from the only South Asian.

South Asians of diverse backgrounds, whether they’ve been in Khon Kaen for
generations or ten months, are making unique impacts on the city’s cultural
landscape and changing local perceptions through daily interactions.

### **From South Asia to Isaan**

Over 29.5 million people have emigrated from South Asia across the world,
according to the [United Nations’ 2017 International Migration
Report](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/migrationreport/docs/MigrationReport2017_Highlights.pdf).
They include people from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Maldives,
Nepal, Bhutan and Afghanistan. Of the millions making up an incredible
diaspora, there are 40 to 50 South Asians living in Khon Kaen.

Although many have recently immigrated due to job opportunities, South Asians
have been in Khon Kaen since the 1930s.

Sporting a turban, a beard, and a hearty laugh, Narinthorn Sachdev, 54, a Sikh
man, recounts his family immigration story of over 90 years. The family of the
proud businessman of Thai, Indian, and Sikh heritage first started coming to
Thailand in the 30s. After Pakistan split from the newly independent Indian in
1947, his clan left their home in Gujirawala District, now Pakistan, and many
moved to Isaan. Khon Kaen is one of the four major cities of Isaan region.

Sikhs have settled in Thailand since the late 19th century. Some of them
migrated as fabric traders and tailors to Isaan. During the Vietnam War, a
second wave of Sikh immigrants moved from Bangkok to cities with large United
States military bases like Udon Thani and Nakhon Phanom, tailoring their
businesses to the needs of American soldiers.

Having been in Khon Kaen for generations, the local Sikh community is strong,
with an active temple located in the city center. Sikhs in Thailand have
gained royal patronage — support from the royal family. Sikhism is one of five
religions in addition to Buddhism under royal patronage.

### **Growing up different**

Growing up in Khon Kaen in the late 1960s, Narinthorn says it wasn’t always
easy being different from the other children. He remembers his childhood
struggles of being bullied because of his appearance and faith.

But today he laughs about these experiences as he recalls a time when his
father came and scared the bullies away because the kids had never seen a tall
man with a turban and long beard like him.

Many [online
forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/8w6a3r/how_racist_is_thailand_against_indians_i_am/)
claim that Thailand can be unforgiving to people of Indian descent. Racial
slurs against South Asians have been used in addition to other stereotypes,
claiming that Indians have a bad smell, that their food is too oily and
unhealthy, that they exploit and cheat people and more.

One user on “Reddit” wrote in a
[thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/8w6a3r/how_racist_is_thailand_against_indians_i_am/e1ttyjl/?context=3):

But Narinthorn is sure that he hasn’t faced much discrimination in Khon Kaen.
Because of his long-standing local business, his family has gained a lot of
respect in the community. At the same time, though, he has grown a bit tired
of constantly having to convince people that his nationality is Thai.

### **A warm welcome**

Other South Asians who moved to Khon Kaen more recently say their experiences
have been overwhelmingly positive.

Sanchita Chatterjee, an Indian working as a program specialist at the Mekong
Institute, describes Khon Kaen as a fantastic place to live for her and her
daughter. She acknowledges the struggles that come with raising a child in a
new country, but this has little to do with their Indian background.

> it. It’s not like anyone stares or anything. That’s not in the culture…Thais
> are very accepting.

Nazir Ul Haq, a Pakistani Muslim working at the Mekong Institute who migrated
to Khon Kaen over two years ago, doesn’t feel that his identity plays a large
role in his work. Although he has faced some issues in other countries, such
as Myanmar, because of his identity, overall, he feels that it is not
something that affects him in Thailand.

her identity. Photo and caption from The Isaan Record, used with permission.

Restaurant owner Quinn has experienced a lot of curiosity because of his
appearance, looking South Asian and dressing in Western-style clothing.

Before coming to Khon Kaen, Quinn had moved to the United Kingdom from Sri
Lanka at the age of nine after his father was killed in Sri Lanka's civil war.
He quickly learned how to adapt to a new culture.

> In a way, [adapting to Thai culture] wasn’t forced on me because I knew I
> had to [adapt] if I wanted to live here, since I’ve done it before…It was
> kind of easy. I knew what I had to do.

Reflecting on the racism he faced growing up in the UK, he says he never
experienced anything like that in Khon Kaen.

> They don’t give you any headaches, any nasty stuff like we get in Europe or
> America nowadays. They’re like ‘Are you happy in Thailand, in Khon Kaen?’
> That’s cool!

“People kept saying to me, ‘it’s not possible…you can’t sell Indian food here.
You can’t do that.’ No. If you put your mind to it, you can do it,” Quinn
says. Photo and caption from The Isaan Record, used with permission.

Originally, Quinn believed widespread claims that Thais don’t like Indian food
and marketed his restaurant mainly toward foreigners. But he was happily
surprised when proved wrong. Around 60-70 percent of Quinn’s customers are
Thai. And he didn’t make his restaurant work in the middle of the city, but
rather in one of the semi-rural villages on its fringes.

> People just came up with all kind of assumptions, you know, and I believed
> it as well, but looking at it now, it was completely wrong, and without
> [Thai customers], I probably wouldn’t survive at all.

> “I want to change the narrative about Indians through food!” Quinn says.

Through daily life and interactions, the small number of South Asians are
slowly changing minds about stereotypes and initial perceptions that people
have. They are taking steady steps to be a part of Khon Kaen’s growing
cosmopolitan community and change the way people think about them.

“I think I’ve changed the narrative quite a bit in this village,” Quinn says
as he quickly gets up to help a server with a delivery.

The sun sets on the beautiful, outdoor terrace of the restaurant as customers
walk in and out of the restaurant. Quinn sits back down, looking out into the
busy atmosphere of his restaurant, a smile on his face. “See? Thais love the
food!”
