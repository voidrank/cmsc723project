To assert their rights and demand implementation of the law, a Transgender
Pride March [took place in
Lahore](https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/lifestyle/pakistans-first-ever-trans-
pride-parade-held-in-lahore/), Pakistan, on 29 December 2018. For the first
time in the country's history, Transgender people dared to step out of their
seclusion and demanded that the Government implement The Transgender Persons
(Protection of Rights) Act, of May 24, 2018.

The Constitution of Pakistan says that “No person shall be deprived of life or
liberty save in accordance with law,” which is covered under the [Fundamental
Rights of
citizens](http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html).
However, Transgender persons have a [different story to
tell](https://www.them.us/story/trans-women-violence-pakistan) when it comes
to their rights and life; they have faced torture, rape, been burnt alive,
beheaded and even shot dead, yet the state did not help them despite the
passing of [the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights)
Act](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/09/609700652/pakistan-
passes-historic-transgender-rights-bill) by the Government in March 2018.

Jannat Ali, nicknamed [Lahore's Trans
Diva](https://dailytimes.com.pk/124369/meet-jannat-ali-lahores-trans-diva/),
is the founder of Track Transgender and Program Director of Sathi Foundation
which organized the Pride March. Other transgender people and non-transgender
supportive members also played their role in the execution of the march and
its success. Sathi Foundation is a transgender-led organization working for
the welfare of the transgender community in Pakistan.

The march was attended by nearly 250 transgender people from all provinces of
Pakistan. Prominent among them were Kami Sid, Bebo from Sindh, Nadra from KPK,
Anmol from Sahiwal District, Nayab from Okara, Sunaina Khan (Classical
Dancer), Naghma & Lucky (Coke Studio Singers), Laila Naz and Neeli Rana. The
event started with a [Press
Conference](https://timesofislamabad.com/01-Jan-2019/pakistan-s-first-ever-
trans-pride-parade-held) at the Lahore Press Club where the demands of the
community were presented; after which they marched to Al Hamra Cultural
Complex on the Mall dancing and singing songs on the way, where they dispersed
after food.

Even though the press conference was held in the Lahore Press Club the Pride
March was not covered by mainstream media. Although organizers invited
officials, like Punjab MNA [Saadia
Sohail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Sohail_Rana) from Pakistan
[Tehreek e Insaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf),
government officials didn't attend the event. The march did generate some
attention on social media where people appreciated the parade while some
questioned the reason for its non-coverage by mainstream media.

According to organizer Jannat Ali:

> The aim was to show positive and progressive image of Pakistan and how the
> country is slowly accepting us and we are gaining more space in the society.
> Pakistan is not only about terrorism and a conservative society there is
> more to us. We promoted our march along with our KhawajaSara (transgender)
> culture and traditions it was not the same type of march as it is held in
> US.

The march also emphasized a positive and progressive image of the transgender
community; it also called attention to the discrimination and violence. Due to
limited options in mainstream jobs, transgender people are [forced to turn to
the sex
trade](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233722955_Is_social_exclusion_pushing_the_Pakistani_Hijras_Transgenders_towards_commercial_sex_work_a_qualitative_study)
to earn a living. Due to unsafe sex practices, many have HIV and AIDS. The
police and doctors also need to be sensitized as they are often making life
difficult for Transgender people who reach out for help or medical assistance.

Despite the legislation, transgender people continue to face extreme
hostility. Since 2015, at least [500 transgender people have been killed in
Pakistan, ](https://www.samaa.tv/news/2018/09/500-transgender-people-have-
been-killed-in-pakistan-since-2015-sc-told/)while Jannat Ali says that more
than 60 transgender individuals have been killed in the last year alone.

Asad Zaidi tweeted about the general impression of Pakistanis towards the
transgender community:

> RT'd a tweet about the trans pride march in Pakistan and lost a bunch of
> followers. Bye (:

In a talk at TEDxLahore in 2017, Jannat Ali
[shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV3DU3PtC0o) her painful journey
about being a transgender person in Pakistan after coming out to not just her
family but to society at large as well.

The [Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act
2018](http://www.senate.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1520932539_231.pdf) passed by
majority votes in the National Assembly ensured that the community could
obtain a driver's license, passport, have the right to get their gender
changed in National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) records,
stopping of harassment, access to educational, employment in trade and health
services without discrimination.

It also mentions that safe houses for transgender people, medical and
educational facilities and psychological counseling will be provided to them
by the government. They will be entitled to inherit property and will also
have the right to vote in elections.

Pakistan is slowly starting to make strides when it comes to transgender
visibility. A few Transgender people
[contested](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1717448/1-13-transgender-persons-
will-contest-general-elections-year/) the General Elections 2018 for National
and Provincial Assembly seats for the first time. A local TV channel [hired
its first transgender anchor](https://globalvoices.org/2018/04/01/marvia-

attitudes-toward-her-community/.); Coke studio, a music program,
[featured](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/viral-news/coke-studio-
pakistan-features-transgender-performers-wins-hearts/articleshow/65114288.cms)
two transgender people in an episode.

While things are changing for the transgender community and they are slowly
being accepted, the process is slow. However, many are optimistic that things
will soon change for the better and these people will get their place in
society with the rights and privileges of citizens equal in the eyes of
society and the law.
