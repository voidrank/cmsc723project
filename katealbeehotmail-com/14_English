Özgecan Aslan's murder sent shockwaves through Turkish society but getting
gender equality on the policy agenda is still an uphill struggle. Image by

When a long search for the missing 20-year-old university student [Özgecan
Aslan](https://globalvoices.org/2015/02/16/turkey-mourns-a-female-students-
brutal-death/) ended with the discovery of her charred body in a riverbed in
the south-central city of Tarsus in February 2015, the news sent shockwaves
through Turkish society.

A 26-year-old minibus driver, Suphi Altindoken, confessed to the murder.
According to his own testimony, he first tried to rape Aslan and then stabbed
her to death when she fought back. Following the attack, Altindoken, his
50-year-old father Necmettin Altindoken and his friend Fatih Gokce burned
Aslan's body in order to dispose of the evidence.

The brutality of Aslan's death shone a torchlight on gender-based violence in
Turkey and caused a surge of public indignation.

Calls for justice for Aslan and her family were quickly accompanied by demands
for action to prevent violence against women and build gender equality into
the national education system.

On December 3, 2015, Suphi Altindoken was
[sentenced](https://tr.sputniknews.com/turkiye/201707171029317360-ozgecan-
katil-sanik-agirlastirilmis-muebbet/) to 27 years in prison, while Necmettin
Altindoken was sentenced to life imprisonment. Gokce received 24 years
imprisonment.

But on April 12, 2016 the younger Altindoken was killed in jail and his father
seriously injured by a prisoner called Gultekin Alan, who[
said](http://www.diken.com.tr/ozgecanin-katilini-oldurmustu-gultekin-alana-
agirlastirilmis-muebbet-ve-29-yil-hapis-cezasi/) his attack on the pair was
motivated by his obsession and revulsion over the Özgecan Aslan tragedy.

Yekta Sarac, the President of Council of Higher Education (YÖK), meeting with
female rectors of Turkish universities for the March 8 International Women's
Day, 2016. Erçin Top for Andolou news agency.

Hopes for institutional support for gender equality had received a major boost
earlier that year when Yekta Sarac, the President of Council of Higher
Education (YÖK), [met](https://bianet.org/bianet/kadin/172814-yok-ten-
toplumsal-cinsiyet-esitligi-icin-taahhutler) with female rectors of Turkish
universities to mark International Women's Day on March 8, 2016.

The main outcome of the meeting was to affirm the ‘Higher Education
Institutions Gender Equality Attitude Certificate’. ****

The document had been in the works since the year Aslan died, and
[stated](https://bianet.org/bianet/kadin/172814-yok-ten-toplumsal-cinsiyet-
esitligi-icin-taahhutler) that the higher education regulator would
incorporate gender equality and justice across its work, that universities
would hold gender equality lessons, seminars, and panels and that universities
would ensure safe campuses for women.

### **Gender equality is not among our values**

There were always fears that the certificate would remain symbolic in nature
but on February 19, 2019, YÖK stunned gender equality advocates by disavowing
the document's very foundations.

Sarac, still the council's president, was
[quoted](http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/1254403/YOK_ten_gericilere_taviz.html)
by the Cumhuriyet media outlet as citing “different perceptions” of gender
equality as a reason for revising the document.

> 2015 yılında hazırlanan bu tutum belgesinde kadına yönelik her türlü
> eşitsizlik ve adaletsizliği önlemeye yönelik yürütülen bu çalışmalar
> ‘Toplumsal Cinsiyet Eşitliği’ kavramı adı altında dile getirilmiştir. Ancak
> gelinen süreçte bu kavrama, murat edilenin dışında farklı anlamlar
> yüklendiği ve bu yüklemelerin ‘toplumsal değerlerimiz ve kabullerimizle
> mütenasip olmadığı ve toplumca kabul görmediği’ hususunun göz önünde
> bulundurulması gereği ortaya çıkmıştır. ****

> The Certificate, which was prepared in 2015 and [sent to all
> universities](http://dekaum.deu.edu.tr/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Tutum-
> Belgesi.pdf) in order to prevent inequality against women, was framed
> according to the term ‘Gender Equality’. However, in this process, it
> emerged that the concept (gender equality) has different meanings other than
> the ones that are being implemented. We need to consider that these meanings
> are not appropriate for our values or accepted by our society.

Sarac went on to suggest ‘gender equality’ would be removed from the concept
note and that universities should focus instead on ‘family':

> Bugün itibarıyla tutum belgesinde ‘toplumsal cinsiyet eşitliği’ kavramı
> çıkarılarak güncelleme yapılmasına ilişkin çalışmalar son aşamasına gelmiş
> olup yakında üniversitelerimize duyurulacaktır. Kadın çalışmalarına yönelik
> derslerin müfredatını ‘Toplumsal Cinsiyet Eşitliği’ değil ‘Adalet Temelli
> Kadın Çalışmaları’ anlayışı içerisinde belirlemeye ve verilmekte olan ders,
> konferans ve seminerlerde Türk toplumunun aile kavramı başta olmak üzere
> sahip olduğu üstün değerlerin öne çıkarılmasına özen göstermesi
> gerekmektedir

> From today, we are removing the term ‘gender equality’, revising (the
> certificate) and sending it to all universities again. It is necessary to
> use ‘Justice-Based Women's Studies’ rather than ‘Gender Equality Studies’.
> We need to pay attention to the importance of Turkish society and the family
> concept in lectures and seminars.

### **‘We will not give up’**

Women organisations and social media users reacted with outrage to Sarac's
comments that appeared to imperil the very future of academic fields like
gender studies and implied the government sees women largely as homemakers.

Some Twitter users argued that YÖK was bowing to the pressure of conservative
media, which has [targeted](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/don-bu-
yanlistan-yok-607217.html) the certificate as a “deviant” document that
encourages same-sex relations and bears the imprint of a debauched West.

The [University Women Collective](http://universitelikadinkolektifi.net),
founded in 2007 by women university students, protested in front of YÖK's
building on March 1.

One banner held up by a protester read: “Get your own social values, equality
is ours.”

Aslan's murder, while chilling in its particular barbarity, pointed to an
alarming trend of lethal violence against women in Turkey that has only
worsened in the years since.

We Will Stop Femicide Platform’s Gülsüm Kav claimed this month on Twitter that
in the first two months of this year alone, 74 women were killed in Turkey.

That figure puts 2019 on course to reach the 440 femicides recorded for 2018,
a total which represents a 45 percent
[increase](http://www.kadincinayetlerinidurduracagiz.net/kategori/veriler) on
the figure for 2015, the year Aslan was killed.
