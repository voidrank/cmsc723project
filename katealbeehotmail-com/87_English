Who would have thought that architecture could be so closely connected to
things like identity, culture and politics? Certainly not Professor [Lesley
Lokko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesley_Lokko), back when she was studying
the discipline at London's prestigious [Bartlett School of
Architecture](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/).

But now, as head of the [Graduate School of
Architecture](https://universityofjohannesburg.us/international/architecture/)
at the [University of
Johannesburg](https://universityofjohannesburg.us/international/) in South
Africa — which she plans to make the “biggest and the best on the continent” —
Lokko doesn't see things in the typical way.

This unique perspective is just one of the reasons she's considered such a
prominent figure in the emergent African architectural scene. Lokko enjoys
examining these sorts of juxtapositions. Half Ghanaian, half Scottish, she
first studied sociology, then Hebrew and Arabic at Oxford, then decided she
wanted to become an architect. She graduated from the prestigious [Bartlett
School of Architecture](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/) in
London and began her professional career, while simultaneously creating a name
for herself as a [best-selling novelist](https://lesleylokko.com/books/).

On the invitation of the [Trinidad and Tobago Institute of
Architects](http://ttia-architects.org/) and [Bocas Lit
Fest](https://www.bocaslitfest.com/), the country's premier annual literary
event, Lokko recently made her first visit to the twin island republic, where
she gave a few public lectures on the importance of architecture in today's
society, literature and more.

She sat down with Global Voices for a fascinating chat about globalisation and
identity, and the parallels she sees between Caribbean and African societies.
In this, the first of a series of posts about her visit, we discuss race,
culture, innovation, and the impact that architecture can have on society,
particularly postcolonial ones.

**Global Voices (GV): How did you come to be Professor Lesley Lokko? You seem
quite liminal in a field that's generally all about structure.**

> **Lesley Lokko (LL):** My father was part of the first wave of Africans who
> were sent overseas to study. A lot of them came back with foreign wives, so
> there was a whole generation of — we call ourselves ‘half-castes’ — that’s a
> particular Ghanaian term, but a whole bunch of mixed race kids who are the
> product of that particular period in history.

**GV: Did that help shape your worldview?**

> **LL:** It did, and I’m probably more conscious of it now in a much more

> black was, but suddenly the black part of it was the overarching identity.
> And it took me a long time to come to terms with that because blackness to

> white — and I couldn’t quite get my head around now _not_ being something
> was the primary identity; that somehow you’re identified by a _lack_ of
> something.

**GV: Let's talk about that in relation to architecture. Looking at apartheid-
era South Africa, for instance, how does architecture enhance — or limit —
people's potential? How does space affect output?**

> **LL:** Historically, the role of the architect was always to project onto

> words, to build representations of the values that a particular culture
> holds dear. To give a more concrete example, you could say a house is a
> representation to the outside world of the aspirations, hopes and
> experiences of the people living inside it. But at the same time, you don’t
> expect your built structures to represent the _real_ you — what you’re
> looking for is the best possible representation — the ambitious, cultured
> image of yourself. You don’t expect your buildings to represent your
> tensions, your insecurities and your mistakes; you want your architecture to
> represent the best of you.
>
> If we think about the colonial and post-colonial world, at nominal
> independence, which is the political franchise, suddenly you take the
> emotional experience of that period of your own history — the struggles for
> self-determination, self-worth and the re-evaluation of what’s usually been
> a suppressed and oppressive history — but you find that it’s very difficult
> for your architecture to express that. What tends to happen is that the new
> political reality simply borrows the ‘old’ or existing architecture — the
> structures, buildings, ways of living and working — and you’re unable to
> articulate what the tension between that real, lived experience of the
> struggle for independence might have been and what your aspirations for the
> future now are.
>
> In South Africa, certainly, architecture was always complicit in oppression.
> Apartheid might have been a political and social structure, but it was also
> a physical one. Now, two generations after that first wave of great
> decolonisations in Africa and a generation after South African independence,
> I think people finally have the courage to look at this discipline that

The house that Professor Lesley Lokko designed and built upon her return to
Ghana. Photo courtesy Lokko, used with permission.

When Lokko left the UK and moved back to Ghana to work as a writer, the first
thing she did was build a house — out of mud — a modern house, built using a
traditional technique.

In Trinidad and Tobago, that traditional style of house was called
[“ajoupa”](https://caribbeanhistoryarchives.blogspot.com/2011/08/life-before-
air-conditioning.html). Created by the Amerindians, the style was freely
adapted over the centuries by the country's settlers to the point where
architect [John Newel
Lewis](https://caribbeanhistoryarchives.blogspot.com/2012/03/architecture-in-
trinidad-and-tobago.html) called it “the prototype of Trinidad architecture”.

**GV: This traditional building approach is no longer used in Trinidad and
Tobago, primarily because it could not scale — and with globalisation, there
is now greater consumption of foreign trends. Are we discounting our own
innovativeness?**

> **LL:** It’s a complex question, but I’ll answer it a roundabout way. When I
> first started writing, I had a very clear idea in my head of who my audience
> was. My publishers had a completely different idea. I had deliberately tried
> to bring together two genres of writing — one was highbrow literature around
> questions of identity, race, interracial relationships, political histories,
> and the other was the blockbuster — and it was a conscious decision to take
> these two genres and somehow combine them. I was aware that it was probably
> going to take some time for that hybrid to fully emerge but I realised that
> my publishers had targeted the books primarily at working-class,
> aspirational women — secretaries, receptionists, people who wanted a bit of
> glamour and travel and exotic locations, but who didn’t necessarily want a
> complex literary read. I remember having these endless arguments with them
> because every book cover was a girl in a sarong walking down a beach. I
> hated the covers. Eventually, someone in marketing allowed me to see some of
> the data they used when deciding on the PR campaigns. I got a stack of paper
> with reams of binary code, and I said, ‘What is that?’ And they’d say, ‘Oh,
> it’s a woman who’s got a high school education and works in a bank, goes to
> Ibiza on holiday and drives a Golf.’ I’d be like, ‘How do you translate that
> [profile] to code? But that code — and I think it’s in a sense the pre-
> runner of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) — was the
> rationale behind the marketing campaign. And I remember thinking, ‘The
> people I’m interested in probably fall in between code categories, and a
> marketing code cannot accommodate that.’

> **LL:** So to answer your question about taste, because those sorts of
> things are the underlying structure in terms of how taste is formed, what
> you see in West Africa, for instance, is that the manufacturing plant that
> once made a particular product is going out of business because another
> product is overtaken it. But on the side of the road you’ll find an
> enterprising young man who takes bamboo and tries to make that product, but
> doesn’t have the infrastructure of a small company, [so] he’s locked into a
> copy relationship forever. He’s not generating anything new; all he’s doing
> is trying to approximate, but that approximation is also the formation of
> its own taste. It’s a really deep-seated relationship between the confidence
> of the self to generate culture and the insecurity that simply follows
> culture, always from somewhere else — but even in that act of following
> culture it’s producing something. It’s almost like self-deception — you
> think you’re not putting yourself into it because you are copying it, but
> every act of making is its own thing in a sense.

> My house doesn’t look like a mud house, but I remember my father coming when

In the next instalment of this series, the conversation turns to technology,
relationships and the synergies between architecture and writing.
