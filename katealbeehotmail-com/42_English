In October 2017, 16-year-old Faiza Mohamed Abdi was shot in the “[pelvic
area](https://www.hiiraan.com/op4/2017/dec/145922/victims_of_sexual_violence_against_women_in_somalia_deserve_justice.aspx)”
for declining the sexual advances of her attacker in the port town of
[Bosaso,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosaso) Somalia. Abdi was brutally
wounded by Abdikadir Warsame, a solider with the security forces in Somalia’s
semi-autonomous region of [Puntland.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puntland)
Since December 2017, Faiza has been undergoing
[treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17exbw7SLU) in a hospital in
Turkey. [Radio Dalsan](https://radiodalsan.com/en/mogadishu-mayor-thabit-abdi-
send-a-rape-victim-for-overseas-medical-treatment/) reports:

> Faiza was reported to have been attacked by a Puntland state navy soldier

Unfortunately, Faiza is not alone. Although some of Somalia's semi-autonomous
regions have made recent attempts to push through anti-rape legislation, a
general culture of impunity allows many violators to go[
unpunished](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/07/somalias-uphill-battle-to-
criminalize-sexual-violence/) — and tales of rape
[abound](http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2011/10/26/living-hell-somalias-
hidden-rape-epidemic).

### Rape in camps for Internally Displaced People (IDP)

In Somalia, more than two decades of civil war and famine have forced many
people to flee their homes and live in IDP camps. Women and girls who live in
camps outside the main cities [are the most vulnerable to sexual
assault](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/12000/afr520092013en.pdf).
They do not have any protection and most rape cases occur in the middle of the
night or when they are collecting firewood in remote areas. At the same time,
due to the breakdown of the criminal justice system, victims often do not have
access to the legal assistance necessary to seek justice.

Fiican, a 45-year-old single mother and [Buulo
Ba'alay](https://gecpdsomalia.org/where-we-work/galkayo/the-minority-women-
centerschool-buulo-baaley/) IDP camp resident, was raped in front of her
children. She described the event in an interview with GV, stating:

> It was a midnight when an armed man with Puntland police uniform cracked my
> home, took me out by force and raped me. Not only did he rape, he tortured
> me and left me with severe wound on my body that still cause lot of pain up
> to now.

The night of Fiican's assault, men from Puntland Police went to the Bula
Bacley IDP camp in the central city of
[Galkayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galkayo). The men broke into tents,
taking Fiican and another mother by force. Both women were raped.
Unfortunately, the victims have yet to receive justice for the violations they
suffered. The assailants were arrested but have neither been charged in court
nor sentenced for their crimes.

According to the [Puntland Human Right
Defenders](https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/puntland/somalia-puntland-
human-rights-defender-releases-crime-statistics), 80 rape cases were reported
in Somalia’s semi-autonomous region of Puntland in 2017. The real number of
rapes is thought to be much higher because many victims do not speak out due
to fear of stigmatization, a lack of trust in the [criminal justice
system](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/13/here-rape-normal/five-point-
plan-curtail-sexual-violence-somalia) and a lack of prepared health
facilities.

Aside from the issues of justice, another obstacle for survivors of sexual
assault is the lack of [health
infrastructure](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/13/here-rape-normal/five-
point-plan-curtail-sexual-violence-somalia), modern tools, and equipment that
are required in this sector. The health system also lacks the qualified
personnel to handle rape-related cases.

Local culture can also be an obstacle to justice because of a regional custom
which obligates victims to marry their assailants or accept “[camels or
livestock](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-rape/somali-gang-rape-
video-sparks-call-for-justice-not-fine-of-camels-idUSKBN153271)” as
compensation for their assault:

> Rape is pervasive and often goes unpunished in much of Somalia, where
> decades of conflict have fueled a culture of violence and weakened
> institutions meant to uphold the law. Traditionally, rape victims are forced
> to accept compensation – often in the form of camels or livestock – and
> marry their assailants in a centuries-old practice designed to end war
> between rival clans.

### Small steps in the right direction — but is it enough?

On 9 Sept 2017, the semi-autonomous region of Puntland made headlines when it
opened the first [forensic lab](http://somalia.unfpa.org/en/news/new-forensic-
centre-gives-hope-justice-against-sexual-offenses) to handle rape cases in the
city of [Garowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garoowe).

The year before, in September 2016, Puntland also became the first
administrative region in Somalia to pass an [anti-rape
law.](http://somalia.unfpa.org/news/puntland-passes-law-against-sexual-
offences)The House of Parliament voiced resounding support with 42 out of 45
members voting in favor of the bill which was later officially made into law.

On 6 January 2018, the Parliament of self-declared state Somaliland followed
Puntland's lead and also proposed a new [anti-rape
bill.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42604496) However, there is still
a long way to go before it is passed by the
[Guurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Elders_\(Somaliland\)) (House
of Elders) and is signed into law.

Although the rape issue has attracted attention from the Somali government as
well as the international community in the past years, sexual violence against
women and children remains rampant and the number of assault cases continues
to grow.
