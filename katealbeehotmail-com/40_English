In 2014, several indigenous communities in the Mekong started
[recording](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/index.html) their stories
and legends with the help of a group of researchers who are exploring how
these narratives can help exposing the destructive impact of large-scale
projects in the region.

The Mekong is one of Asia’s great river systems which flows through six
countries: China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It is rich
in biodiversity and a vital source of livelihood for millions of farmers and
fisherfolk.

In recent years, several large-scale projects such as hydropower
[dams](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44936378) have displaced residents
while threatening the river basin's ecosystem. Despite protests, the
construction of dams has continued, especially in Laos and Thailand.

In partnership with Mekong Watch, a Japan-based group advocating sustainable
development in the region, several community elders in the Mekong began
recording some of their stories and legends in 2014 that revolve around
nature. Mekong Watch
[believes](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/about.html) that these
stories “have played an important role in protecting nature by avoiding the
over-exploitation of natural resources.”

Mekong Watch asserts that part of the commons that need to be protected are
not just natural resources but also [“intangible
heritages”](http://www.mekongcommons.org/commons-are-telling-peoples-
folktales-and-legends-on-their-environment/) that can be shared and accessed
by the local community. Toshiyuki Doi, senior adviser of Mekong watch, adds:

> People’s stories should be regarded, recognized, and respected as Mekong’s
> commons, especially these days when they are losing their place in local
> communities to more modern media, and are not passed on to next generations.

Areas in the Mekong where researchers conducted fieldwork. 1. Kmhmu’ in
northern and central Laos; 2. Siphandon in southern Laos; 3. Akha in northern
Thailand; 4. Thai So and Isan in northeastern Thailand; 5. Bunong in
northeastern Cambodia. Used with permission.

The group was able to collect a total of 102 stories in Cambodia, Laos, and
Thailand. Stories were recorded, transcribed, and translated into the national
languages of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before an English version was made.
Mekong Watch published these stories as pamphlets in both printed and digital
formats, and [used](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/about.html) them
during environment workshops they conducted at the communities.

> Since late 2016, we have used people’s stories to provide environmental
> education to children in rural Laos and Thailand. We have hosted workshops
> in schools and local communities to guide children, and sometimes adults, to
> collect stories from elderly people, learn from the stories, and turn them
> into reading materials.

An example of a workshop involves the retelling of the story of [‘The Owl and
the Deer’](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone1-story6.html) from
Kmhmu’ people in central and northern Laos. The story is about an owl who lost
his ability to see during the day after cheating a deer.

During a workshop, young participants are
[asked](http://www.mekongwatch.org/PDF/PeopleStoryPB_Eng.pdf): “What kinds of
animals appear in the story?”, “Can you see these animals in your village?”,
and “If there are fewer of these animals in your village than before, why do
you think this has happened?”

After this, participants are encouraged to connect the story to the
deterioration of the environment in their communities.

In Champasak Province, south Laos, the legend of the endangered [Irrawaddy
dolphin](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone2-story2.html) and the
Sida bird is used to highlight how a dam project is
[disrupting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws5KJSamhTY) the seasonal
migration of Mekong River fisheries.

Another story also from southern Laos is instructive on the
[value](http://www.mekongwatch.org/PDF/Booklet_PeopleStory.pdf) of resource
management:

The story about the Rhino Head was recorded on November 16, 2014, at the
Songkram River bank in northeast Thailand. The narrator was Mun Kimprasert,
aged 68. Photo by Mekong Watch, used with permission.

> Once, a soldier stepped into a spirit forest. He discovered a lot of tobacco
> leaves there and collected them. However, when trying to leave the forest,
> he could not find an exit. It was because he took more tobacco leaves than
> he could possibly consume for himself. No matter how hard he searched, he
> could not find a way out of the forest. Realizing what might have been the
> problem, he finally decided to return the tobacco leaves to the forest. The
> moment he dropped them on the ground, he was able to see an exit in front of
> him.

In northern Thailand, a story by the Akha people about the origin of the
[swing](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone3-story4.html) teaches
self-sacrifice through a heroic episode of a brother and a sister who put the
world in order.

In northeast Thailand, a folktale about [Ta
Sorn](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone4-story5.html) narrated by
Tongsin Tanakanya promotes unity among neighbors in a farming community.
Another story recalls how the hunting of a rhinoceros led to the formation of
[salt trading](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone4-story14.html) in
this part of the country.

In Bunong, located in northeast Cambodia, there are stories about rituals to
[fix](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone6-story1.html) bad marriages
and planting and
[harvest](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone6-story2.html) ceremonies
narrated by Khoeuk Keosineam. There is also the legend of the
[elephant](http://www.mekongwatch.org/peoplestory/zone6-story4.html) as retold
by Chhot Pich which reveals how villagers who once poisoned a river were
punished by the gods and turned into elephants. It explains why elephants were
comfortable living with humans but, after several generations, they forgot
their origins and went to live in the forest.

For Mekong Watch and the threatened communities in the region, preserving
these stories is integral in the campaign to
[resist](https://wrm.org.uy/articles-from-the-wrm-bulletin/section1/stories-
identity-and-struggles-how-local-communities-live-with-and-talk-about-mekongs-
landscape/) projects that would displace thousands of people living in the
Mekong:

> These stories can help form their identity as a community member and
> identify with the environment. By means of stories, the communities search
> for ways to accommodate and/or resist changes that are taking place in the
> Mekong river basin.
