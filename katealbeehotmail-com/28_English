“Anthropology emerged from a specific historical moment in time and,
especially at the outset, was used for expansive, colonialist, and oppressive
purposes. I believe this was the case for several other sciences, however […]
Anthropology is evolving and including other voices and perspectives…” Elena

Elena Garcia is from Madrid, Spain. Garcia has studied philosophy,
anthropology and international aid with a focus on gender issues. She has
experience working with migratory populations in Spain and providing aid
assistance in Colombia, Senegal, and Equatorial Guinea. As a woman of African
descent who has lived on three continents, she addresses the growing outspoken
criticism of anthropology and development aid work by anti-racist activists.

The following insights are shared below:

****AfroFeminás (AF): Anthropology is a social science often discussed from a
de-colonial perspective. What do you think of the criticism? Is it an issue
that stems from anthropology or the anthropologist?****

> **Elena Garcia (EG):** It is true that anthropology emerged from a
> particular historical moment and was used for expansive, colonialist and
> oppressive means, especially in its early days. However, I believe this has
> been the case for several other sciences, so I find that critique unfair at
> times. Anthropology, like other sciences, is evolving to include other
> voices and perspectives, so I don’t believe we should stick to an obsolete
> nineteenth-century image.

**AF: Is it possible for ‘de-colonial anthropology’ to really thrive as a
study?**

> **EG:** Of course it's possible. Anthropology is not a colonial science by
> default, although it has been used in certain contexts for specific
> objectives.
>
> In its broadest definition, anthropology is the study of human beings. I
> would look to the example of [Cheikh Anta
> Diop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheikh_Anta_Diop), who raises
> interesting and relevant awareness about contributions of Black African
> culture that have often been ignored or undervalued by the west.

### **Cooperation and development: a problematic exchange**

**AF: You’ve worked for a long time in international aid, another
controversial sector. How do you think this reputation developed?**

> **EG:** Above all, development aid is controversial because it functions as
> another method of Western imposition of culture and thought toward other
> parts of the planet. The aim is not to improve living conditions of
> beneficiary populations, but to introduce them into the system. This is a
> dangerous mistake.
>
> One of the clearest cases with regard to this is seen in gender equality and
> women’s empowerment projects that are so in vogue these days. It starts from
> the premise of white, western feminism, without questioning the institution,
> and is therefore considered “advanced” and aimed at creating “achievements”
> which very well may not be.

**AF: Could better partnerships in this area be a solution? What about South-
South cooperation?**

> **EG:** Yes and no. Partnerships are complicated. Sometimes they consist of
> conscientious organizations seeking to improve the living conditions of the
> populations they assist, but most of the time, the vast majority are engines
> of the machinery. Populations have learned to deal with westerners by
> telling them what they want to hear, showing them what they want to see and
> even, as perverse as it sounds, acting as intermediaries between
> organizations and communities in a way that benefits them; organizations
> have become a kind of intermediary elite who look out more for their own
> interests than the real demands of the beneficiary populations.
>
> South-South cooperation is essential, but as it always serves the interests
> of the countries involved it is carried out in a serious and aggressive way,
> because it is also sometimes used as a method of expanding the national
> interests of large emerging countries. This is a problem we are facing now.

### Identities and contexts

**AF: You are Afro-Spanish and have lived in two African countries, along with
one American country with a large population of African descent. Do you
believe that has influenced your reception there?**

> **EG:** I wouldn't know how to convey it exactly. I partly believe so,
> especially in Latin America where there is some mutual recognition and
> pairing off among people and communities of African descent.
>
> It's different in Africa, one of the things that surprised me the most in
> Africa is that people call me white. At first that was a real shock to me.

**AF: I imagine when you arrive in Africa you stop being perceived as African
and start being seen as a “Toubab”** ( _Central and West African name for a
person of European descent_ ). **Is it difficult to rebuild an identity via
external context?**

> **EG:** Exactly. It is very difficult, because one goes about their lives
> with the idea of feeling recognized a certain way, but that doesn't always
> happen everywhere you go. On the contrary, you often end up being viewed as
> “responsible” for a history that is so much larger than you and that, in
> some way, you are also the result of.
>
> In the end, we mestizos are strangers everywhere and it is something we
> learn to live with.

**AF: Speaking of your Afro-Spanish background, how have your multiple
identities fit into a country like Spain? And how has Spain responded in turn?
Could it be the subject of an anthropological analysis?**

> **EG:** It is not easy to be different in a country like Spain, and it is
> not easy not to feel recognized within your own country.
>
> I will say that Spain itself has passed through different eras with respect
> to her African descended population. At first, when I was little, it felt
> isolating and curious, and people would do things like congratulate me on
> speaking “Spanish so well.” Around 2000, being of African descent was
> irremediably associated with immigration and shrouded by negative
> implications that affect women in particular. Today I want to believe that
> we are in a different phase, with greater empowerment, visibility, and
> recognition of African descended populations, although there is still a lot
> of ignorance.
>
> It should certainly be the subject of anthropological analysis as it is
> quite a pertinent subject.

**AF: What projects are you involved in right now? What do you have planned
for the future?**

> **EG:** Right now I am going back home. I am focusing on the processes of
> African descended community empowerment that are happening, especially in
> Madrid. It has been nice to come back here and find so many active movements
> with which I share a common experience and desire for change. It is very
> interesting what is happening, very enriching.
>
> I would like to focus more on the integration of migrant populations in
> Spain. At the moment I would prefer not to work outside it for a while,
> because I love Madrid and I have missed it very much, but you never know.
> Life always surprises us.
