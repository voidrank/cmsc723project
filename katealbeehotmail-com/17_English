One of the groups actively promoting freedom of expression in Myanmar is a
youth-led group called [Athan](https://twitter.com/athan_info) — which means
‘voice’ in the Burmese language.

Although recently established in 2018, Athan has already gained
[credibility](https://www.seapa.org/myanmar-amid-narrowing-space-for-free-
expression-youth-group-plods-on/?utm_source=fb) for publishing reports about
the state of media freedom in Myanmar under the government of the National
League for Democracy (NLD). NLD is headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
Laureate and former democracy icon who fought the junta which ruled the
country for several decades.

Athan’s free speech advocacy has been acknowledged not only within Myanmar but
also by [international
institutions](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-free-speech-
activist-wins-dutch-human-rights-award.html) which are monitoring the
country’s transition to democracy.

Athan [celebrated](https://twitter.com/athan_info/status/1085056161525551104)
its first anniversary on 15 January 2019 by highlighting the reports it
published about the country’s media situation. It noted that threats to
freedom of expression had worsened despite the landslide
[victory](https://globalvoices.org/2016/02/02/for-myanmars-people-aung-san-
suu-kyis-government-marks-a-new-dawn/) of NLD in 2015. Maung Saungkha, founder
and executive director of Athan, summarized the group’s [2018
report](https://twitter.com/athan_info/status/1082147813721427968) in an email
interview with this author:

> According to Athan’s collected statistics, there were 53 prosecutions and
> lawsuits under Telecommunications Law, 36 prosecutions against 124 activists
> under Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law in 2018 only. Besides,
> 2018 saw 12 journalists were sued and prosecuted for allegedly breaking
> controversial and draconian laws of Myanmar. In fact, there were 153 cases
> under the Telecommunications (Law) since the time the new government was
> formed by NLD after the 2015 general elections.

Global Voices has previously reported some of the issues tackled in Athan’s
report such as the continued
[use](https://globalvoices.org/2018/03/21/saynoto66d-documenting-the-surge-of-
online-defamation-cases-in-myanmar/) of Junta-era laws to

the harassment of activists.

Asked about what reforms are needed to improve the media situation in Myanmar,
Maung Saungkha reiterated the recommendations of Athan about the amendment of
several repressive laws:

> According to Athan’s findings, there have been 44 journalists charged under
> 28 prosecutions and lawsuits under various controversial laws of Myanmar
> under this current government. A journalist was murdered and some
> journalists were fired for covering news or expressing their own opinions on
> social media too. These statistics show existing Media Law has weaknesses
> which are used by government officials, military personnel and business
> companies to silence and arrest journalists.
>
> So, Media Law must be amended in parliament. All lawsuits filed against
> journalists must be withdrawn. All journalists staying under detention
> including Reuters journalists must be released unconditionally. Defamation
> must be decriminalized in accordance with international standards.

The [case](https://globalvoices.org/2018/01/19/reuters-journalists-covering-
rohingya-conflict-in-myanmar-detained-for-illegally-acquiring-information/) of
the detained Reuters journalists refers to Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo who were
convicted for investigating the massacre of civilians in a Rohingya village.
The Rohingya are not recognized as a minority ethnic group in Myanmar.

Athan’s work also includes lobbying with local and national agencies to push
for the removal of obstacles to freedom of expression. But Maung Saungkha has
expressed concern that the space for citizen engagement is shrinking:

> Main challenge is difficulty to meet and discuss with parliament and
> committees of parliament. We have experienced parliament denying our several
> submissions. One of the other challenges is people’s misunderstanding and
> misinterpretation on human rights. This is why Athan is organizing
> trainings, workshops on freedom of expression for students and political
> activists, and to inspire them to fight for freedom of expression.

Recognizing these challenges, Athan has stepped up its media advocacy work,
its partnership with international networks, and its organizing of community
education programs.
