An epic poem written in 1965 expressing the grief of Yugoslavs over the
assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy was posted on Twitter
by a historian last November 2018, which reminded many of the close relations
between the former Yugoslavia and the United States during the Cold War era.

Milorad Lazić, [а PHD candidate at George Washington
University](https://history.columbian.gwu.edu/milorad-lazic), tweeted about an
epic poem titled “Death in Dallas” which reflected the popularity of Kennedy
in Yugoslavia.

The full 17 minutes of the epic poem sung by Jozo Karamatić, an ethnic
Croatian singer from Herzegovina, [released as 7″ single record by Zagreb
company Jugoton in 1965](https://www.discogs.com/Jozo-Karamati%C4%87-Smrt-U-
Dalasu/release/4989445), is available online in several YouTube versions.

#### **Epic poetry in Balkan culture**

Oral [epic poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry), or the
retelling of the deeds of mythical beings and heroes in long verse form, has
been a trademark of the cultures of the Balkan peoples since the time of Homer
who wrote _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. In the 19th century the poetry of the South
Slavic peoples received much attention by Western scientists as a living
embodiment of ancient practices that had vanished in the rest of Europe. Many
of the folk singers sung their rhyming tales of resistance to invaders
accompanied with a one-string musical instrument called [gusla or
gusle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusle) in the manner of medieval
[bards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard).

The tradition continued well into the 20th century in the mountainous parts of
Montenegro, Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. After World War II it
became part of Yugoslav pop culture, as folk music enjoyed revival through the
development of vinyl record industry.

Besides the old classics, some of these folk singers also composed their own
pieces based on the traditional styles. One of these records include the epic
poem ‘Death in Dallas’.

#### **Kennedy and Yugoslavia**

After a period of cooling down of relations between the United States and
socialist Yugoslavia in the late 1950s, Kennedy’s administration worked hard
to ensure that it would remain independent i.e. it would not become part of
the Soviet Bloc. This included reinstating Yugoslavia's Most Favored Nation
status to re-enable trade and economic aid, as well as boost the prestige for
Yugoslav leadership which kept balancing between the West and the Soviet
Republic.

Kennedy, a World war II veteran, also already had a favorable reputation in
Yugoslavia because of his support to the anti-fascist cause.

He even visited the country once during a European tour when he was still a
senator.

Moreover, [Kennedy achieved hero
status](http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a232756/Kako-je-Jozo-Karamatic-uz-gusle-
opjevao-smrt-J.F-Kennedyja.html) among ordinary Yugoslavs thanks to the speedy
US aid reaction after the [earthquake that devastated Skopje in July
1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Skopje_earthquake), killing over
1,070 people and leaving around 200,000 homeless. Just two days after the
tragedy struck, the US Army delivered hospital services that helped tend to
the thousands injured. Kennedy’s administration kept providing many kinds of
aid including temporary housing.

Improvement of relations culminated with the first visit by Yugoslav leader
Josip Broz Tito to the White House in October 1963. The gracious meeting
between the two leaders is amply [documented by the Kennedy presidential
library](https://www.jfklibrary.org/search?search=Tito&sort_by=search_api_relevance&sort_order=DESC&items_per_page=100&f\[0\]=subject_person:Tito,%20Josip%20Broz,%201892-1980).
In Yugoslavia, it served as proof of the greatness of its leader and by
association, the importance of the country on the world stage in spite of its
small size.

All of the above factors contributed to the intensity of the shock and
mourning after the assassination of Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

In its own peculiar way, the epic poem “Death in Dallas” had provided a record
of the feelings that resonated among ordinary people from Slovenia to
Macedonia.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the singing of epic poetry become less popular, as
the public turned to shorter song forms. However, some of the nationalist
factions which started the Balkan wars in the 1990s promoted it as part of
their propaganda as a way to show that they are defenders of tradition. It is
[still practiced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV0WJY9zhbM), albeit almost
exclusively within the framework of preserving folklore tradition.
