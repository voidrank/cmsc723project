4-year-old Marwan, temporarily separated from his family in Syria, is assisted
by UNHCR staff to cross to Jordan. Released to the media [via

As of early July 2018, the Syrian government continues to [engage in an
offensive](https://thearabweekly.com/daraa-could-mark-syrian-regimes-ability-
act-impunity) on “remaining rebel pockets in southern Syria” according to the
Arab Weekly. Intensive aerial strikes on the city of Daraa have been launched
in an attempt to [wipe out remaining rebel
forces.](http://www.theweek.co.uk/syrian-civil-war/91922/what-is-happening-in-

[fled air and ground attacks](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-

the last two weeks, according to the United Nations.

The Syrian war has displaced [more than

civil-war-homeless/index.html) Syrians in just two weeks. Neighboring Jordan
has accepted over[ 1.3 million ](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/no-
legal-obligation-jordan-receive-more-refugees-%E2%80%94-pundits)refugees over
the past seven years, but recent protests in the country that led to the
resignation of the previous government have resulted in the new government’s
refusal to keep their borders open.

However, closed borders have not stopped Jordanians from lending a hand to
Syrians.

Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the capital city of Amman are
asking citizens for assistance to alleviate the harsh conditions experienced
by displaced Syrians near the border town of [Al-
Ramtha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_Ramtha) in Jordan. While some NGOs
existed before the crisis in Syria began, others were created just recently to
address the influx of an estimated 40,000 [displaced
Syrians](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/un-urges-jordan-to-
open-borders-to-fleeing-syrians-1.6241347) at the border.

For example, the NGO Eghathet Al-Malhoof (meaning “Helping Those in Need” in
Arabic) partnered with the Jordan Environmental Committee to collect and
distribute donations along the border. Similarly, the Masar Initiative joined
efforts with the UNHCR and other international NGOs that received permission
to carry out relief activities with the same purpose.

The NGOs have distributed fliers, contacted government officials, and shared
posts via social media to call for help of all kinds, including volunteer
recruitment and donations collection. The fliers include advice on edible food
donations, requesting donations of canned food, bread, water and bottled
drinks. The groups have also put out a call for medicine, health and sanitary
supplies, tents, and baby essentials. Cash donations are accepted, but the
NGOs prefer physical donations to avoid the complications of handling cash.

Osama Hajjaj, a member of Masar initiative, told Global Voices (GV) that
volunteers are needed and those who cannot devote entire days come after work
to assist. Masar director Mohammed Al Garalleh explained to GV that he is very
pleased with the amount of help received so far and adds that reactions on
social media were immediate and responsive. Garalleh also states that the
Jordanian army is handling the distribution of donations and that his
organization will not turn away anyone who offers to help.

According to Eyad Al Jazzazeh, head of Eghathet Al Malhoof, they have received
a profusion of donations from individuals, organizations, private companies,
and businesses.

Over [250](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/11-displaced-syrians-
admitted-jordans-public-hospitals) doctors, nurses, and medical units have
volunteered and are camping out at Al-Ramtha to help anyone who seeks medical
attention, in addition to ensuring that no contagious diseases or viruses
spread among displaced Syrians at the border. Some patients have been
[admitted to Jordanian public
hospitals](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/11-displaced-syrians-
admitted-jordans-public-hospitals).

In addition to the outpouring of tangible help, two trending Twitter hashtags,
[#open_the_borders](https://twitter.com/nabihbulos/status/1012336389839638528)
and
[#we’ll_share_our_bread_in_half,](https://www.facebook.com/AJA.Syria/videos/%22%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B3%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B2/10156913643074893/)
have added to the mobilization for aid and support. While Jordan struggles
with its own challenges, many Jordanians think the displaced Syrians should be
admitted into the country according to recent citizen responses on Twitter:

### Jordan: open hearts, closed borders

The [United Nations](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/un-urges-
jordan-to-open-borders-to-fleeing-syrians-1.6241347) (UN) has urged Jordan to
open up their borders, warning that displaced Syrians near the border have no
other option and their lives are at stake. However, Jordan remains obstinate
regarding its decision to keep the borders closed, telling the UN to provide
security within Syria.

Just a month before the strikes, Jordan announced that it [cannot accept any
more refugees.](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-cannot-take-any-
more-syrian-refugees-%E2%80%94-officials)

ِRecent [peaceful protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/jordan-
protests-180604052840527.html) in May 2018, organized by unions over a new
income tax law, triggered Jordanians to speak out on other grievances,
including the burden of refugees. This resulted in the resignation of the
government as a whole and the new government has grown very careful about
issues concerning refugees, as some people tried to [blame the country's
woes](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/jordan/.premium-jordan-s-calm-
could-be-broken-by-discontent-under-the-surface-1.5883896) on them.

The current government feels [“no
obligation”](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/no-legal-obligation-jordan-
receive-more-refugees-%E2%80%94-pundits) to open the borders, given that the
support for [the response refugee plan](http://www.jrpsc.org/) (a strategic
partnership plan between Jordan and the international community) stands at a
disappointing [7 percent this
year,](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/support-refugee-response-plan-
stands-disappointing-7-year) in contrast to the [65 percent in
2017](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/support-refugee-response-plan-
stands-disappointing-7-year).

Key supporters of Syria's administration include Russia and Iran, while the
United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia all back government rebels. However,
the U.S. and other rebel allies have [reportedly abandoned them
](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-rebels-
south-20180705-story.html)and are no longer sending them help.

Through their embassy in Amman, Jordan, the U.S. sent a message to the south’s
rebels telling them they [should not count on any American
firepower.](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-rebels-
south-20180705-story.html)

Rebels now find themselves alone without help, and civilians are torn between
going back to cities under strike where death is guaranteed or [waiting on
Israel and Jordan's
borders.](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2018/07/israel-joins-jordan-
in-saying-we-will-not-allow-syrians-to-enter-our-territory/)
