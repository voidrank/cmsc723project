[ArTree Nepal](http://artreenepal.com/about-us.html#artree), a group of six
Nepali artists, is on a mission to make communities aware of social issues and
foster meaningful dialogue through their contemporary art. The group has
raised pertinent issues like [Dr. Govinda KC‚Äôs hunger
strike](https://globalvoices.org/2014/02/16/one-nepalese-doctors-hunger-
strike-wins-action-from-officials/) to [reform the medical
sector](http://artreenepal.com/culture-of-silence-p1-2016.html), Nepali youth
[migrating for foreign jobs](http://artreenepal.com/serendipity-art-
festival-2016.html), [discrimination on the basis of caste and
ethnicity](http://artreenepal.com/himalayan-art-festival-2018.html), and
[human trafficking](http://artreenepal.com/disensus-2017.html) among others.

‚ÄòOpposite Dreams: The Politics of Local‚Äô showcasing how Nepal‚Äôs history has
excluded the stories of marginalized, underprivileged, and indigenous peoples.

Have a look at their artwork:

Mala-800x479.jpg)

‚ÄòMahendra Mala‚Äô by Subas Tamang. Image by the author. Used with permission.

Artist Subas Tamang's installation art ‚ÄòMahendra Mala‚Äô delves into the
chapters of the Nepali book of the same name that promoted a single religion,
a single language, and a single culture. He has minutely carved the chapters
on slates used for roofing in rural areas. The slates can be flipped around
and they have chapters from the book on one side while the other sides make up
the name of the book.

The artist spoke with Global Voices, stating that ‚ÄúOne day, a Danphe (Nepal‚Äôs
national bird Lophophorus) pecked the grains left to dry on the sun by Lamas,
the [Tamang people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamang_people).‚Äù Explaining
one of the stories in the book, he added, ‚ÄúThe Lama drove the bird away
northwards. In the winter, the Lamas descend to warmer Terai but Danphe,
afraid of the Lama, never ventured a journey to the Terai, the southern
plains. The information given in the book itself is wrong. While Danphe is a
Himalayan bird living in the Himalayas, the Lamas have been presented as cruel
in nature.‚Äù

In ‚ÄòDeath of Civilization‚Äô, Bikash Shrestha has carved the Basantapur Durbar
Square on pieces of wood and bulldozed parts of it with huge tire prints.

In ‚ÄòHow I Forgot My Mother Tongue‚Äô, Mekh Limbu showcases a collection of books
read by his father. His artwork emphasizes how the curriculum promoted a
single language Nepali, thus making others forget their vernaculars.

‚ÄòMasinya‚Äô by Lavkant Chaudhary. Image by the author. Used with permission.

The artwork ‚Äò[Masinya](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp7AoORhI9_/)‚Äô by Lavkant
Chaudhary delves into the issue of
[categorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_Nepal) where
the [Tharu people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharu_people) were grouped as
Masinya Matwali (enslavable alcohol drinkers). Through a set of 13 etched clay
pots, the artist explains how the categorization, land reform, [spraying of
DDT in Terai](https://tharuculture.blogspot.com/2011/08/coping-with-ddt.html),
and the influx of people from hills took away everything from the Tharus. He
told Global Voices, ‚ÄúAmong the 13 pots, I‚Äôve etched the contents of the
investigative report of [Tikapur
incident](https://www.recordnepal.com/wire/trouble-in-tikapur/) in the three.
The Tharus were [victimized in the
incident](https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/03/calls-to-investigate-
retribution-against-the-tharu-community-in-nepals-far-west-grow-louder/) and
the government has still not made the report public.‚Äù

Hit Man Gurung, in his work ‚ÄòHow Many Times I Have to Burn It‚Äô, brought
together opinion pieces on different protests and revolutions against the
rulers that happened in Nepal, burnt them and photographed them. Through the
letters, still legible in the burnt papers, he wants to convey the message
that while there are problems and inequalities in the society, there will be
grudges that will turn into protests and revolutions.

‚ÄòCultural Colonization‚Äô, by Sheelasha Rajbhandari, shows the traditional
dresses worn by indigenous Tharus, Newars and Gurungs emblazoned with
counterfeit clothing tags of world famous brands. The artwork questions the
mentality of the young generation who feel mortified to wear their traditional
dresses but readily wear the copies of authentic brands.
