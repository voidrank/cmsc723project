New Year’s Eve celebrations in Russia, a few post-Soviet countries and the
diaspora abroad have a number of defining characteristics. One is the annual
telethon of Soviet film classics such as [Moscow Does Not Believe in
Tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Does_Not_Believe_in_Tears), a 1980
[Mosfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosfilm) production which won the
Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film and a few other accolades.
The other absolute classic is [The Irony of
Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irony_of_Fate) (1976), traditionally
broadcast on December 31 by a major national channel while millions of Russian
families busily chop bucketloads of [Olivier
salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_salad).

However, the generation of Russians born around that time, who are now in
their mid-30s and early 40s, are increasingly finding these role models
unsuitable for the modern age and their views downright insulting. Around New
Year’s Eve time, Russian social media fills with critical posts from users who
are suddenly discovering that their parents’ television favorites promote
values that are far from progressive:

> Давайте про «Москва слезам не верит». Как вам такой посыл: ты можешь быть
> директором завода, депутатом Моссовета, хорошей матерью (одиночкой), но
> состоишься ты только тогда, когда накормишь супом своего пьяненького мужика-
> слесаря?

> Let’s talk about “Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears.” So how do you find this
> message: you can become a factory director, a Moscow city council member, a
> successful mother (and a single one at that), but you’ve only achieved
> success in life when you’ve fed some soup to your boozed-up plumber
> boyfriend?

Such attitudes are still prevalent in Russia, so feminist collective
Rosgendernadzor (a play on official organization acronyms meaning, roughly,
Rusgenderwatch) summed up these modern frustrations in a series of screencaps
from several Soviet film classics accompanied with captions that imagine how a
character could have responded to a casually sexist or demeaning remark.

Here’s one from Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears where the female protagonist
is pressured into having sex with a fashionable and well-connected young man
above her current station who then abandons her when she gets pregnant.

Or this retort from The Irony of Fate, a highly acclaimed dramedy about two
strangers in stable but unfulfilling relationships brought together by New
Year’s Eve drunkenness and the ubiquity and uniformity of Soviet mass-produced
public architecture:

Men’s repressed feelings are also cared for (this is from a 1972 comedy
miniseries [The Big School-Break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_School-
Break), or The Long Recess, about a young teacher in an adult learning
school):

introducing this project, Rosgendernadzor’s founder said:

> Приближаются новогодние праздники. Встречаем 2019 год, а за столом — все те
> же блюда, на экранах — все те же фильмы. И представления о социальных ролях
> мужчин и женщин все те же. Новый выпуск “тех самых карточек” — про старое-
> доброе советское кино и гендерные стереотипы. Мы вторгаемся в диалоги героев
> новогодних фильмов и помогаем им отвечать собеседникам с патриархальными
> взглядами. Такие взгляды не редкость и сегодня: они поддерживают неравенство
> между мужчинами и женщинами. Поэтому наши ответы могут помочь и вам. С Новым
> годом!

> The New Year’s festivities are approaching. 2019 is just around the corner
> but little has changed: the same snacks are on the table, the same movies
> are on the TV and the same views on men and women’s social roles remain in
> place. This new set of ‘those cards’ is about good ol’ Soviet cinema and
> gender stereotypes. We decided to butt in on dialogues in films typically
> shown on New Year’s to give the characters a chance to talk back when
> confronted with patriarchal views. Such views reinforce unequal
> relationships between men and women, and they’re not uncommon today. That
> means that our replies can help you too! Happy New Year!

idea further:

In these images, each of the principal male character's remarks such as “Keep
in mind that I am going to make all the decisions on the simple basis of me
being a man” are met with a curt “Why don't you just f**k off then, Georgy.”
