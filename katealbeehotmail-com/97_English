With five votes for and three against, the judges of [Ecuador's Constitutional
Court have
recognized](https://twitter.com/FedeLGBTI/status/1001540928241373184/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felcomercio.pe%2Fmundo%2Flatinoamerica%2Flesbianas-
inglesas-podran-registrar-apellidos-hija-ecuatoriana-noticia-523641) the right
to identity of children with same-sex parents in what is known in the country
as [the Satya Case](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caso_Satya).

Satya is the child of Nicola Rothon and Helen Bicknell, two British women
living in Ecuador who are in a [civil
union](https://elpais.com/sociedad/2014/09/18/actualidad/1410991430_619743.html)
and conceived their child through artificial insemination.

However, Satya's birth in 2012 [brought with it a legal
battle](https://es.globalvoices.org/2012/06/01/ecuador-casosatya-homofobia-y-
libertad-de-expresion/). In Ecuador, as in other Hispanic countries, it is
customary for people to have two surnames: in the case of heterosexual
couples, one last name from the paternal side and one from the maternal side.

But when Rothon and Bicknell tried to register their child with both of their
surnames, the Civil Registry of Ecuador refused.

Six years later, after legal complaints, debates, and [numerous discussions
across citizen and traditional
media](https://es.globalvoices.org/2016/04/05/ecuador-reconoce-las-uniones-
entre-homosexuales-pero-que-pasa-con-sus-hijos/), the court decided in early
June 2018 that the Civil Registry must register Satya with the last names of
both her mothers.

The decision
[prompted](https://twitter.com/NicolasHallo/status/1007419988058230785) many
[different reactions](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CasoSatya?src=hash) online.
Across websites like Medium, for example, observers theorized that Satya's
story will echo throughout civil rights history in Ecuador.

Human rights expert Patricio Benalcázar Alarcón
[highlighted](https://medium.com/retazos-de-dignidad/satya-derechos-de-una-
familia-diversa-9fb0a53dea4c) that the reactions of the Civil Registry workers
were a reflection of how the case challenged the heteronormative standards
that had been accepted as “natural” throughout the country's history:

> La Corte Constitucional al resolver la acción extraordinaria de protección,
> da un paso trascendente y transformador frente a las estructuras culturales,
> jurídicas, ideológicas y políticas que sostuvieron un régimen de
> discriminación […] por su parte, Satya, Helen y Nicola a través de su sueño
> de vivir la simple y tierna felicidad de una familia, rompen materialmente
> siglos de exclusión y plantean a la sociedad la legítima presencia de la
> diversa condición humana.

> The Constitutional Court performing this extraordinary act of protection is
> an important and transformative step taken in light of cultural, judicial,
> ideological, and political structures that that support a system of

### One case of many

[Same-sex parent families do exist in
Ecuador](http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/documentos/web-
inec/Estadisticas_Sociales/LGBTI/Analisis_situacion_LGBTI.pdf), but their
invisibility in the law causes constant problems. If, for example, one of the
parents dies and the child does not share the surviving parent's last name,
that parent [loses all parental
rights](https://es.globalvoices.org/2014/12/16/asesinato-de-activista-por-
matrimonio-igualitario-en-venezuela-evidencia-consecuencias-de-la-desigualdad-
legal/) to the child as they are not legally registered as parent and child.
This reality can even result in the child being put up for adoption by the
state.

The consequences of parents splitting up can mean the loss of parental rights,
and access to alimony, visitation, and more can be limited due to the legal
rights of inheritance and identity.

Overall, these uncertainties are a result of the fact that same-sex families
do not have equal rights before the law. Thus, from the editors of the
[website Andes](https://www.andes.info.ec/es/noticias/sociedad/17/satya-nacio-
en-malchingui), the decision of the court is significant:

> Es, además, una forma de reconocer una situación social que se da de hecho y
> cuyo desconocimiento oficial no hace sino llevar a niños, niñas y
> adolescentes que se crían en familias no convencionales a no gozar de la
> protección que deben proveer el Estado, la sociedad y la familia para lograr
> su desarrollo integral.

> It is, furthermore, a way of recognizing a social situation that does, in
> fact, occur, in which ignorant officials do nothing but take away boys,
> girls, and teenagers who are raised in non-conventional households where
> they do not experience the protection they should from the sate, society, or
> family to achieve their full development.

Other analysts who [study the Satya
case](https://twitter.com/GKcityec/status/1006330258788843521) argue that its
relevance has yet to be seen:

### Only the beginning

It appears that the court's ruling would be solely for this case, and the
National Assembly will have one year to create new legislation surrounding
this loophole. For now, [public apologies from the Civil
Registry](https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/judicial/12/corte-
constitucional-sentencia-satya-sanciones-disculpas) as expected, as well as
sanctions to the workers who refused to register Satya. Those following the
case expect that the legislative body would use the ruling of the Satya case
as a guide to set a new standard to be recognized for the country's
constitution, the right to identity, equality in front of the law, and the
main points of interest of the case: the rights of children who are part of
same-sex parent families.

Beginning with a [constitutional referendum in
2008](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refer%C3%A9ndum_constitucional_de_Ecuador_de_2008),
the legal framework for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex (LGBTI) community in Ecuador has expanded over the last several
years. That reform recognized diverse families in a broad sense, the
difference between identity and sexual orientation, and universal civil
unions, amongst other things.

Still, after a decade with the new Ecuadorian constitution in place, societal
norms still exist that discriminate against members of the LGBTI community and
keep them from exercising their rights, making them less visible.

A [short documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfyylYgtAT8&t=86s)
titled “Satya: The Case of Helen and Nicola” sheds light on the complexity of
the debate. LGBTI rights activists, human rights defenders, and
representatives of groups that are against recognizing Satya as a girl with
two mothers participated in the making of the film.

In the case of the latter, they say the reason for their opposition is not
because of religious reasons, but “anthropological reasons”: they seek to
defend the “respect of the laws of nature” and the “balance” that comes from
the education given by families made by a man and a woman.

Human rights defenders, on the other hand, argue the importance of looking to
other cases in the past, like women's vote — which for many was unthinkable
less than a century ago — and collective social advances. They aspire for
Ecuador to join the global trend in which equality is becoming the norm
through the formal recognition of the rights of all people, especially those
not acknowledged in patriarchal or heteronormative societies, and whose rights
could be threatened by the law.

Danilo Marzano, a member of the LGBTI community who was interviewed for the
documentary during one of the rallies to support Satya, Nicola, and Helen,
said:

> “En realidad hoy más que un deseo personal es un deseo colectivo. […]
> Necesitamos estar incluidos dentro de los beneficios constitucionales como
> ciudadanos de primera categoría. No es solamente el caso de Satya […Es]
> importante reconocer constitucionalmente el derecho de las familias
> homoparentales; que tanto hombres como mujeres de las poblaciones del LGBTI
> podamos tener derecho a conformar nuestras propias familias […] derecho al
> desarrollo de la libre personalidad de amar [más aún al estar bajo la
> protección de una constitución] supuestamente tan de avanzada […] tan
> progresista [Algo que, sin embargo] no ha sido cierto.

> In reality, [the recognition of diverse families] is more a collective
> desire than an individual one. […] We need to be included in the same
> constitutional benefits [as everyone else, and] as first-class citizens. It
> is not only the Satya case [… It's] important to legally recognize the
> rights of families with same-sex parents; that both men and women in the
> LGBTI population could have the right to shape our own families […] right to
> develop our own individual freedom to love [even more so when under the
> protection of a constitution that [is] supposedly so advanced […] so
> progressive. [Something that, despite this,] has not been true.

The defense of these rights takes on more importance in the face of the
[findings of the National Institute of Statistics and
Censuses](http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/inec-y-comision-de-transicion-
presentan-resultados-de-la-primera-investigacion-sobre-condiciones-de-vida-de-
la-poblacion-lgbti/) (NISC), which reveal alarming levels of discrimination
and violence: “Of all of the members of the LGTBI community interviewed, 70.9%
reported that they had experienced discrimination in their home environment.”

And of that percentage, “72.1% have experienced being controlled, 74.1% have
experienced some kind of imposition, 65.9% have suffered from rejection, and
61.4% from violence.”
