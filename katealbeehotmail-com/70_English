The male form in various states of undress has featured in Nepali art for
centuries. Just look at the [Chakrasamvara
Mandala](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38021), a 13th-
century [Nepali](http://www.nepalartcouncil.org.np/mirrors-of-the-sacred-
continuity-of-traditional-painting-in-contemporary-nepal/) paubha painting
depicting the union of the deity Chakrasamvara and his consort Vajravarahi, or
the many [statues in erotic poses](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajan-
thapaliya/tudal-an-erotic-art-in-hi_b_14083732.html) found at the Hindu
temples of Kathmandu.

Nevertheless, painting nudes and exhibiting them in public still requires a
bit of courage in Nepal. Traditional gender roles in Nepali society see men as
the caretakers of their families, which means they should be muscular and
tough. As in other parts of the world, this “macho” expectation means that men
in Nepal aren’t always comfortable with vulnerability or talking about their
bodies or sexuality.

To start a dialogue about what it means to be a man and celebrate the male
form, two Nepali artists, [Kapil Mani
Dixit](https://www.facebook.com/kapil.m.dixit) and [Roshan
Mishra,](https://www.facebook.com/write2roshan) are
[exhibiting](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-02-07/celebration-
of-male-form-at-mcube.html) their male nude art series at [Gallery
Mcube](https://www.facebook.com/GalleryMcube/) in the city of Patan [until 19
February 2018](https://www.facebook.com/GalleryMcube/posts/1824771884207867).

Talking to Global Voices, Kapil explained, “While men appreciate the female
bodies, why do they sheepishly look at male bodies?”

> God has created equally beautiful male and female bodies. Male are as
> handsome as female are beautiful. Let’s celebrate about our body. Why is it
> that we shouldn’t talk about it?

“The pink in my painting connotes the access the society hasn’t given us. It
has put us in shackles within the pink colour,” says Kapil. Photo by Sanjib

Two characters in a single frame – one vulnerable, another “macho.” “It’s okay
to be you, men too can cry, men too can be sensitive,” says Kapil. Photo by

Roshan has used himself as a model for his conceptual series of work. He said:

> My work represents the negativity that lies in our society about the male
> form. Most of the males feel uncomfortable to talk about their own bodies
> and share their feelings, thoughts, and sexuality. My eight of the
> conceptual work shows a trapped male figure that has been struggling to come
> out from its shell….Some of the works show the negative male body surrounded
> by vibrant, colorful surrounding and other works show a body trapped and
> wrapped with the social status and fear within. Depicting the subtle nudity
> of my own body, through this exhibition, I have tried to reach out to those
> males who feel timid, shy, tender, depressed, confused, lost or even feel
> dominant. I want them to celebrate the male figure that is given to us by
> the grace of the god and be who we are.

Kapil added, “Many people came to me and said they had been thinking in the
same way but weren’t able to talk about it”:

> It’s not only our feelings but we’ve expressed the feelings of all males.
> Males never talk about these issues.
