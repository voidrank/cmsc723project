The shocking suicide of a 14-year-old girl at a state school in Azerbaijan's
capital Baku has brought to light the stigma surrounding school bullying in
the ex-Soviet country and sparked demands for officials to be held
accountable.

Elina Hajiyeva's mother Sevil Hüseynova
[says](https://www.bbc.com/azeri/azerbaijan-47868971) her daughter had
repeatedly complained of suffering bullying at the School No. 162 in Baku that
she was recently enrolled into, but noted that the director of the school,
Sevinj Abbasova, had ignored the complaints and insisted all was well.

Wilful reluctance to engage with allegations of bullying is not uncommon in
Azerbaijan's schools and on this occasion it had tragic consequences.

On April 4, Hajiyeva threw herself out of a third floor window in the school
and died after being hospitalised.

The lengths Abbasova allegedly went to cover up the death proved a tipping
point for many Azerbaijanis, who have been posting news and views about
Elina's death under the hashtags #BullinqəSon (end bullying) and
#ElinaÜçünSusma (Don’t be quiet about Elina).

Activists like [Nijat
Mammadbayli](https://www.facebook.com/nijat.mammadbayli.7/posts/10157375624190288)
provided the initial push to amplify the story, which trended all week on
Azerbaijani social media.

Specifically, Abbasova has been accused of pressuring one of Elina's
classmates not to talk about the incident with the press and also pressuring
journalists to cover the event in a way favourable to the school.

The first of these accusations was
[issued](https://www.facebook.com/NurlanLibre/videos/837452999926898/) by the
classmate herself in an interview with independent journalist Nurlan Libre.

The second emerged after news website Mövqe.az released what appeared to be a[
recording](http://www.movqe.az/news/sosial/131949.html?fbclid=IwAR35GrydtjxDJZraW5xCZNDH6FbjdXqriRg4WtiaFcg8Tn9EL1wAK_37nhk)
of Abbasova telling one of the website's journalists to “write it in this
way”:

> Write it in this way. She is a child of an immoral, failed family. Her
> mother got married for the second time and has other children and she does
> not care about her (Elina).

On April 12, Abbasova, her deputy Lala Maharramov and school psychologist
Konul Agayeva were all dismissed. Many users have called for them to be
prosecuted.

Video blogger Alikhan Rajabov made a heart-rending clip about Hajiyeva's death
that was widely shared.

### Could Elina's life have been saved?

On April 11, Hijran Huseynova, the chairperson of the Azerbaijani State
Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs
[said](https://sputnik.az/life/20190411/419997574/ilham-eliyev-intiharla-
bagli-gosterish-
verib.html?fbclid=IwAR1LidQqKT44qrr_WncY_W8HcKKS2JWf8X9qerTi4iPoNacosRgUW4y5sYg)
that Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev had taken the investigation into
Hajieva's death under his personal control.

But the incident is already fostering revulsion at the authoritarian system he
oversees, not least due to claims that school officials delayed sending Elina
to hospital as part of a damage limitation exercise, and that hospital staff
violated procedures while she was in their care.

Regionally-focused website Eurasianet
[reported](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijani-girls-death-by-suicide-shocks-
nation):

> [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMF3DC5tlXc) have emerged on social
> media that show an injured Hajiyeva in the office of the principal after the
> incident. In these videos, administrators try to make a half-conscious
> Hajiyeva admit to suicidal tendencies and place the blame on family

> [ambulance](https://www.meydan.tv/az/article/elina-haciyevani-sok-
> veziyyetinde-danisdiran-qadin-kimdir/) was finally called.

Yet according to [information
obtained](https://www.meydan.tv/az/article/elina-haciyevani-sok-veziyyetinde-
danisdiran-qadin-kimdir/?ref=homepage-news) by Meydan TV, the person who
questioned Hajiyeva in the video was not a school official but Khalida
Bayramova, the deputy head of Sabail District Executive Authority and a friend
of school director Abbasova.

The apparent involvement of a local government official in a country where
school officials are perceived as benefiting from political patronage and
nepotism has further politicised the tragedy.

Public criticism also homed in on hospital staff after a **distressing video**
filmed by journalist Gulnara Ramazanova on April 7 [showed scenes of disorder
](https://www.facebook.com/kananramazanov35/videos/798844517163049/)after
Hajiyeva's life support was turned off, reportedly without her father's
consent.

“Where are the doctors? Where are the officials of the hospital? Why is it
(hospital) security who are talking to us?” Ramazanova can be heard asking.

A post by Meydan TV journalist Habib Muntazir indicates the potential scope of
blame for Hajiyeva's death.

> The following persons, who either caused the suicide of Elina Hajiyeva,
> ignored her death or remained indifferent to it, and who lied to the public
> must be investigated. If they are found guilty, they must be punished
> accordingly: Sevinj Abbasova, director of School No.162; Chimnaz Hajiyeva,
> teacher of the schoolgirl; [name redacted due to status as a minor], a pupil
> of 11th grade at school No.162; Doctors at the hospital “Semashko”: surgeons
> Vagif Nagiyev, Ilgar Ibrahimov, Fazil Aliyev the reanimatologist, Azer

> Medical Center No. 1; Parviz Abubakirov, the spokesman for the Health
> Ministry; the school psychologist and (Abbasova's) husband who is trying to
> save her from blame.

On April 11 parents of pupils at School No. 162 held a memorial for Hajiyeva
in front of the school and called for the director's arrest. One protesting
parent said that she had raised the school management's unprofessionalism with
local authorities recently after her own child had had problems at the school,
but had been ignored.

> A year ago, I complained to government agencies about the school
> administration. If these complaints had been considered, Elina would not be
