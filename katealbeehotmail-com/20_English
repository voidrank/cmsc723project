For the first time in Bangladesh's history, [transgender candidates who
identify as women can vie
](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/2019/01/16/is-bangladesh-
on-the-cusp-of-electing-its-first-transgender-mp)for the 50 seats reserved for
women in the upcoming elections in the Jatiya Sansad or National Parliament.

The election schedule is due to be [announced on 17
February](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/2019/01/14/election-
schedules-on-feb-17-for-reserved-parliamentary-seats), and so far, [eight
members of the transgender
community](https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/js-seats-women-
transgenders-enter-the-fray-1690516) have been confirmed as running on the
[Awami League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League) party ballot, which
is the first and only political party in the nation to allow this.

The [Bangladesh National
Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatiya_Sangsad) has 50 seats among a
total 350 reserved exclusively for women, according to [article
65](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&sections_id=24619)
of the national constitution. In Bangladesh, transgender people are
categorized as
“[hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_\(Indian_subcontinent\))” (a term
referring to a member of the third sex) on their national identity card.
However, there is no specific provision in the constitution that prevents
members of the hijra community from running for the 50 reserved seats.
According to [Election Commission Secretary Helaluddin Ahmed,
](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/2019/01/23/ec-secretary-
transgenders-can-contest-for-reserved-seats)any eligible woman, including
hijras who identify as women, can qualify for the reserved seats.

For Falguni, one of the eight transgender candidates, running for office means
representing the whole transgender community:

> We are citizens of Bangladesh but we have no representation in the
> parliament. There is no one from our community who can understand and raise
> our concerns. That is why we are running for the seats.

Of the 16 million people in Bangladesh, an [estimated 10,000 to half a million
belong to the transgender
community](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/opinion/tahmima-anam-
transgender-rights-bangladesh-labannya-hijra.html). Although there is legal
acceptance of the transgender community by the Bangladeshi Government,
transgender people have faced[
discrimination](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/12/23/i-want-live-my-head-
held-high/abuses-bangladeshs-legal-recognition-hijras) and a tremendous amount
of disapproval, often falling [victim to hate crimes and
violence](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/19/bangladesh-transgender-men-fear-
their-safety). In the past, employment was denied and many people tried
earning money by begging or by singing during weddings and childbirth.

[Pinky Shikder](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15398437), chief of
Badhan Hijra Sangha, said:

> When my parents came to know about my sexual orientation they beat me every
> now and then and forced me to give up my feminine qualities.
>
> They said I was bringing shame to the family. Finally, I decided to leave my
> house and live with other transgender people.

On [November 11, 2013](https://www.csbronline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2016/08/ShaleAhmed_HjraRights_CSBR-ILGAAsia2015.pdf), the
hijra community was officially recognized as a separate gender by the nation's
government. This step was mainly taken as an aim to remove the socio-economic
barriers to the community and to end their discrimination in education,
health, and housing.

A year later, on November 11, 2014, thousands of Bangladeshi transgender
people wearing colorful sarees [marched the first ever Pride parade in the
country](https://globalvoices.org/2014/11/15/photos-hijras-bangladesh-third-
gender-celebrate-first-ever-pride-parade/) to mark a year since their official
recognition as a third gender. The streets of Dhaka were filled with colors
and the sounds of joy as they carried a huge Bangladeshi flag and banners, one
of which read: “The days of stigma, discrimination and fear are over”.

Since then, the transgender community [has been making
strides](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2018/01/13/ec-adding-hijra-
gender-identity-voters-list) towards carving out space for themselves in
Bangladeshi society. On December 2014, the Ministry of Social Welfare invited
the community to apply for government jobs.

On July 2015, after Labannya Hijra witnessed the murder of a secular blogger
Washikur Rahman by Islamist radicals on the streets of Dhaka, and successfully
helped in the arrest of the perpetrators, the Bangladesh Government announced
plans to recruit and enlist [hijras as traffic police
](https://www.dhakatribune.com/uncategorized/2015/05/19/hijras-to-be-
recruited-as-traffic-police)officials.

On July 1, 2018, [Tanisha Yeasmin
Chaity](https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/special/2018/09/16/meet-chaity-
the-first-transgender-employee-at-a-bangladeshi-human-rights-org) became the
first transgender official in Bangladesh's state-run human rights watchdog –
the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

All these events have been widely rejoiced by not only Bangladeshis but by
people around the world. Below Twitter users describe their support for the
Bangladeshi transgender community:

However, Ishti Sajid [questioned their

Awami League-led 14 party alliance had a landslide victory on the [national
elections of 30
December](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bangladeshi_general_election#Preliminary_results)
2018\. Of the 50 reserved women's seats, they have 43. It is still to be seen
how the party, and the transgender nominees running on their ticket, will do
in this year's election cycle.
