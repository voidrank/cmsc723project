In July and August 2018, NGO EDUS (“Education for all”) organized a Summer
school for kids with cognitive disabilities. Photo by EDUS, published with

After an entire year of campaigning for education for children with learning
disabilities, Bosnian parents were left distraught after authorities in
Sarajevo denied a primary school funding for the upcoming year.

Launched in September 2017, the
[#WhereIsMySchool](https://globalvoices.org/2017/09/27/whereismyschool-
parents-fight-for-proper-education-for-children-with-disabilities-in-bosnia/)
campaign (#GdjeJeMojaSkola in Bosnian) demanded authorities include in its
educational system a program developed by [EDUS](http://edusbih.org/en/), a
local nonprofit organization that offers support for educators of children
with special needs.

As the campaign gained traction, the assembly of the canton of Sarajevo
[approved](http://istinomjer.ba/obecanja-djeci-sa-poteskocama-u-razvoju-
epizoda-stota/) a resolution that would obligate the education ministry to
provide both space and human resources to care for such children. Officials
from the ministry [promised](http://istinomjer.ba/obecanja-djeci-sa-
poteskocama-u-razvoju-epizoda-stota/) to work with one local school in
Sarajevo and EDUS to execute the assembly's decision.

However, on August 29, only four days before the school year was due to begin
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EDUS [warned](http://archive.fo/naVhu) that their
educators hadn't yet received payment from the Ministry.

Education minister [Elvir Kazazović](http://archive.fo/2MFoH) rebuffed EDUS’
claim the next day, but according to Truth-O-Meter, a Bosnian fact-checking
initiative, the organization was the one telling the truth:

> Za djecu koja pohađaju nastavu po EDUS-ovom progamu danas je kapija škole
> Isa Beg Ishaković ostala zaključana, jer za njih nije obezbjeđen nastavni
> kadar, a sudeći prema obavijesti EDUS-a tako će ostati do daljnjeg. Ministar
> Kazazović, za svoju izjavu u kojoj tvrdi da su riješeni kadrovski problemi
> sa edukatorima i da su obezbjeđeni uslovi za rad EDUS-a dobija ocjenu
> _neistina._

> Today the gate of the primary school Isa Beg Ishaković remained closed for
> the children who attend education according to EDUS’ program because there
> were no teachers who could welcome them. According to the information by
> EDUS, this state of affairs will continue. Therefore we rate as untrue the
> statement of Minister Kazazović, in which he claims that all human resources
> issues with the educators are solved and that all adequate conditions for
> work according to EDUS program are provided.

Truth-O-Meter added that around 150 children from the Canton of Sarajevo are
now out of school.

The campaigning parents were devastated. Aida Hrnjić, a parent of a kid with
autism, has written [a sorrowful open letter for the influential website
Index.ba](https://www.index.ba/agonija-se-nastavlja-pozivamo-roditelje-da-
bojkotuju-nastavu-3-septembra-sve-dok-djeca-sa-poteskocama-u-razvoju-ne-

> Ministar obrazovanja se jučer na jednoj TV hvalio kako je zadovoljan

> slušajući u malo fras ne dobih i zagrcnuh se od pomisli kako će djeca da se

> Za njih nema ni osnovno.

> Ljudi, zamislite svoje dijete da sjedi i čeka milostinju nesposobnih da se

> To teach them how learn.

Ms Hrnjić asked the parents of neurotypical children to show solidarity
through boycotting the first school day. Another campaigner, Aida Ajanović,
also [shared her
thoughts](https://www.facebook.com/aida.ajanovic.37/posts/10155419489751780)
on her Facebook profile:

> Neću vas ja zvati da bojkotujete, nemate vi sluha za te stvari. Kao što
> nadležni sluha nemaju za moje dijete već godinama. I ako vas vrijeđa ovo što
> govorim, šta ću vam ja. Jer zamislite moju frustraciju, i frustraciju mog
> djeteta. Uvijek zadnji na spisku, uvijek problem, uvijek nepodoban za vaše
> planove, vaše vizije društva i sistema, uvijek zaboravljen.
>
> I dok vi budete ispraćali djecu u školu u ponedjeljak, njih 150 će ponovo
> ostati u svojim kućama. Tegoba jednom, tegoba zauvijek.

> I won't call you to boycott, because you simply don't care for such calls.
> Just like the authorities who have not cared about the needs of my child for
> years. And if you are offended by this, why don't you break contact with me
> altogether. Imagine my frustration, and the frustration of my child. Always
> the last on the list, always a problem, always unfit for your plans, your
> visions of society and the system, always forgotten.
>
> And while you'll be sending your kids to school on Monday, the 150 kids with
> disabilities will have to remain in their homes, again. Once the suffering
> has started, there's no end to suffering.
