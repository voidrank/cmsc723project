Indigenous lives often go unnoticed by the mainstream United States. Ótaés, an
artist from the [Ramapough Lenape](https://www.ramapoughlenapenation.org/)
Nation, is determined to change that.

Using a combination of oil markers and [wheat
pastings,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatpaste) their work can be seen
across the country and “centers around discussing injustices the Indigenous
community faces and exposing erased or manipulated history in the Midwest and
Appalachian region,” they told Rising Voices.

The Ramapough Lenape Nation spans lands in what's known today as New York and
New Jersey. The artist gathers their research from a variety of sources
ranging from archaeological records to oral history told by elders.

Through Instagram ([@ndn.o](https://www.instagram.com/ndn.o/)), Ótaés has
published more than 110 pieces of artwork. For example, this one calls
attention to the fact that [one-third of Native American
children](https://wp.cga.ct.gov/ceo/2018/03/06/one-third-of-native-american-
and-african-american-children-are-still-in-poverty/) live in poverty:
