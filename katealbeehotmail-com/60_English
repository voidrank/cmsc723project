Nine farmers, including two minors, were killed on October 20 in Hacienda
Nene, Sagay City in the central Philippine island of Negros in what could be
the single most deadly attack against peasant activists under the Rodrigo
Duterte administration.

A[ fact-finding
mission](https://www.facebook.com/altermidya/posts/1176849785797814?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBwZEeIYM-D8NyaNW03ycO3soBb93-2WJUPK4uN_KSW49f1qPEWO95M3dZYUJZGNpwi-

led by human rights and civil society groups have pointed fingers to members
of the Special Civilian Auxiliary Army (SCAA), a private militia associated
with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), as the most likely
perpetrators of the massacre that is being dubbed “Sagay 9″.

Members of the government-backed paramilitary group rained bullets from M-16
rifles on the farmers as they were having dinner around 9:30 in the evening.
Most victims [reportedly](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1045245/9-sugarcane-
workers-gunned-down-inside-hacienda) suffered headshots and three of the dead
bodies were doused with gasoline and burned afterwards.

The victims are Angeliffa Arsenal, 47; Rommel Bantigue, 41; Paterno Baroy, 48;
Marcelina Dumaguit; Rene Laurencio Sr.; Morena Mendoza, 48; Eglicerio
Villegas, 36; and the minors Marchtel Sumicad, 17 and Joemarie Ughayon Jr.,
16. Three others were wounded but survived.

The fact-finding mission took place last October 24-25, 2018, with the
participation of the Children’s Rehabilitation Center, Gabriela Women’s Party
Congresswoman Arlene Brosas, Karapatan National Alliance for the Advancement
of People’s Rights, the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, and Salinlahi.

### Land dispute

The “Sagay 9” massacre's victims were members of the National Federation of
Sugar Workers (NFSW) who were occupying an idle portion of the 75-hectare
Hacienda Nene, which the group claims is earmarked for redistribution to
farmers under the government’s land reform program.

The farmers had just started a “bungkalan”, a collective farming program that
serves to assert their claims on the still undistributed land. They began
planting vegetables on the day of the massacre in order to help them survive
the “tiempo muerto” or dead season in between the sugarcane harvest and
planting seasons.

According to the [fact-finding mission](https://kodao.org/2018/10/28/fact-
finding-mission-says-paramilitary-killed-sagay-farmers/), members of the
paramilitary SCAA have been notorious for serving as gun-for-hire mercenaries
on behalf of big landlords like Hacienda Nene’s landowner Carmen Tolentino and
its _arriendador_ or leaseholder Allan Simbingco. The two are in fact close
relatives of Negros Occidental Governor Alfredo Marañon Jr. and Sagay City
Mayor Alfredo Marañon III.

Negros is known for the persistence of the haciendas, vast landholdings from
the time of Spanish colonialism which were first introduced in the island for
cultivating sugarcane.

The NSFW has documented [172 killings of
farmers](https://kodao.org/2018/10/22/nfsw-172-farmer-activists-killed-under-
duterte/), including 45 in Negros alone, in Duterte’s two years in power. The
intimidation and violence against farmers serves, the group says, to
perpetuate exploitative conditions:

> Sugar workers in haciendas, on the average, receive a measly P500 to P750
> ($9.3-$14) weekly wages all year round. Minimum wage is pegged at only P245
> ($4.5) per day for the farm workers but in many haciendas, P80-P120
> ($1.5-$2.2) a day is still prevalent.

On December 21, 2017, NFSW-Sagay City Chairperson [Flora
Jemola](https://www.panaynews.net/peasant-group-member-found-dead-in-sagay/)
was stabbed to death by suspected paramilitary men. [Ronald
Manlanat](http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/protesting-farmers-demand-
justice-for-negros-massacre/), an NFSW member in Hacienda Joefred in Sagay
City, was murdered on February 22, 2018. An entire magazine of an M-16 rifle
was emptied on Manlanat's head.

### Official spin

In the aftermath of the Sagay massacre, government, military, and police
spokesmen have all joined together in accusing the Communist Party of the
Philippines (CPP), its armed wing New People’s Army (NPA), as well as the NSFW
itself, for perpetrating the killings.

The [Philippine National Police (PNP)](http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1052334)
has filed multiple murder cases against Rene Manlangit and Rogelio Arquillo,
two NSFW union organizers who supposedly deceived the victims into joining the
land occupation as part of a conspiracy to spark outrage against the
government.

The AFP has claimed that the killing of the nine farmers is part of a
“[sinister plot](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1046952/afp-chief-
sagay-9-massacre-part-of-cpps-grand-design-to-oust-duterte)” to oust President
Rodrigo Duterte from power. But various human rights and civil society groups
have belied this claim, asserting that the authorities are pushing that
narrative in order to cover-up its own involvement in the bloodbath.

President Duterte himself, in a
[speech](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/29/1864201/state-forces-
arrest-shoot-groups-occupying-land-duterte-
warns?fbclid=IwAR1FICKeEQspegTf6nh085GGTnPFhGa5SNn6Nwb_uUI_tft9n3gUokAmuMY)
delivered on October 28, warned farmers involved in land reform disputes from
resorting to land occupations, saying he has issued an order to the military
and police to arrest and kill all those occupying public and private
properties.

> My order to the police is to shoot them. If they resist violently, shoot
> them, and if they die, I do not care.
