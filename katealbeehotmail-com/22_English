On January 23, 2019, the Thousand Movement, a collective of unions and
grassroots activists, [held
demonstrations](https://viacampesina.org/en/thousand-movement-srilankan-tea-
plantation-workers-to-protest-in-30-locations-for-better-daily-wages/) in [30
locations across](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/12/06/plan-d06.html)
Sri Lanka calling on plantation companies to increase the daily basic salary
of tea estate workers to Sri Lankan [Rs.1000
(US$5.50)](http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/-movement-protests-in-
Colombo-161465.html) or double the current minimum daily wage. Protesters say
that poverty is on the rise among the tea workers as wages stagnate in
comparison to the growing cost of living. According to [Chinthaka
Rajapakshe](https://viacampesina.org/en/thousand-movement-srilankan-tea-
plantation-workers-to-protest-in-30-locations-for-better-daily-wages/),
Moderator of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform (MONLAR):

> Recently researchers from the University of Peradeniya found that Rs 27,707
> (US$ 152) is needed per month for one person in the estate sector to meet

The workers have been protesting since last October after a collective
agreement on the salary hikes of estate workers[ was not
signed.](http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/10/28/news-features/salary-dispute-
estate-workers) The workers
[rejected](http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190113/business-times/storm-in-a-teacup-
reaches-boiling-point-329861.html) a 20 percent (Rs.100) increase proposed by
the Employers’ Federation of Ceylon (EFC), an organization that represents
plantation companies.

On December 6, 2018 hundreds of thousands of plantation workers from all of
Sri Lanka’s tea plantation districts [began an indefinite
strike](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/12/06/plan-d06.html) demanding a
100% hike of thier daily basic wages to Rs.1000 (US$5.50). The protesters
[called off](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/12/15/slpl-d15.html) the
strike a week later after the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), the main
plantation union, ordered them to end all industrial action. Many people from
civil society, including school teachers, [also
rallied](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/11/07/sril-n07.html) for
plantation workers.

### The tea industry in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is the [fourth largest
producer](https://lanka.com/about/interests/ceylon-tea/) of tea in the world
and also the second largest exporter. The country's central highlands and low-
elevation areas boast numerous tea estates which benefit from a climate that
produces high-quality tea. Over the years, tea from Sri Lanka or “Ceylon Tea”
has grown in popularity — almost one-fifth of the teas sold around the world
are from Sri Lanka.

The industry employs (directly or indirectly) [over 1 million
people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_production_in_Sri_Lanka). Many of
the [500,000 tea estate workers](https://www.ucanews.com/news/activists-issue-
warning-to-tea-industry/41663) are Tamils descended from cheap laborers
[brought to Sri Lanka from India](https://spark.adobe.com/page/lhDga3kElCqda/)
by the British colonial rulers in the 19th century, and more than half of the
workers are women.

### Severely Low Wages

Traditionally, workers have been paid [severely low
wages](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-17674937) compared to the national
average. In many cases, they have to collect 16kg to 18kg worth of tea per day
or their pay is halved. They are subjected to harsh [living and working
conditions](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/12/21/sril-d21.html), and
some of them sustain [painful
injuries](https://groundviews.org/2017/08/22/like-drought-parched-earth-the-
painful-injuries-sustained-by-tea-pluckers/) with little medical support from
the tea estates.

Approximately a decade ago, they were protesting to [increase the daily
wage](http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/09/sri-lanka-tea-workersrsquo-demand-for-
higher-wages-hits-a-snag/) to 500 rupees (US$4 in 2009) from 290 rupees
(US$2.5 in 2009). But their demands were not met as the industry [was hit by
the global recession](http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2009/3/41052.html)
and some tea estates were forced to lay off workers.

In 2016, their daily wage was increased by a mere Rs.50 to Rs. 500. Over the
years, the Sri Lankan Rupee has
[depreciated](https://groundviews.org/2018/09/22/money-talks-some-facts-
around-the-depreciation-of-the-sri-lankan-rupee/) while the cost of living has
increased. Their daily wage corresponds to US$2.75 in today's currency, so, in
essence, their wage has not increased in a decade.

As a result, the poverty level among plantation workers has increased,
although the overall poverty in Sri Lanka has declined in the past decades:

The government has [proposed](http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190113/business-
times/storm-in-a-teacup-reaches-boiling-point-329861.html) an all-inclusive
wage hike with the increase to be made over a 3-year period. Under this plan,
the basic increase would be up to Sri Lankan Rs. 625 in the first year with
other allowances, adding up to Rs.1000 daily. Some of these allowances are
based on a daily quota of leaves plucked – so many are likely to miss out. The
proposed increase in basic daily pay in the second and third years would be to
Rs.650 and Rs.675 respectively. However, the demand of the workers is that the
daily basic pay should be increased to Rs. 1000.

The tea estate workers [have no choice other than to continue their
fight](https://globalpressjournal.com/asia/sri_lanka/fighting-poverty-sri-
lankas-tea-estate-workers-demand-pay-increase/) for a fair wage if they don't
want to succumb to enslavement or absolute poverty.
