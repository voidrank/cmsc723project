It's likely that all the news that you've read about Brazil in the past few
days were about its president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain and
congressman who publicly expresses homophobic, misogynist and racist views,
advocates violence against his opponents and [threatens the
press](https://globalvoices.org/2018/10/27/brazilian-journalists-face-hacking-
doxxing-and-other-threats-as-election-draws-near/).

What you might not have read, on the other hand, was about the different ways
Brazilians have found to express their opposition to Bolsonaro — and how
they're pulling forces together to resist what the next four years will bring.

Speaking with [newspaper Valor](https://www.valor.com.br/politica/5955315/so-
uma-frente-apartidaria-contera-um-governo-de-ocupacao), political scientist
Wanderley Guilherme proposed a non-partisan front to face the new government.
He says:

> O país não é fascista. Pode ser conservador e ter um conceito limitado da
> democracia, mas fascista não é. Vamos ter muitos motivos de continuada
> intranqüilidade social. Esta eleição não vai acabar. Agora é que vai começar
> porque os conflitos não vão ser resolvidos. Não tem nada que permita
> antecipar que essa polarização vá diminuir. Muito pelo contrário.

> The country isn’t fascist. It might be conservative and have a limited
> concept of democracy, but it is not fascist. We will have a lot of reasons
> for ongoing social unrest. This election will not be over. It’s just getting
> started because conflicts will not be solved. There is nothing hinting at a
> decline of all this polarization. On the contrary.

We have listed here a few of the Brazil headlines that didn't make it across
to English-speaking media.

### **Women rise up**

Brazil's upcoming Congress will have 51 percent more[
women](https://mdemulher.abril.com.br/estilo-de-vida/numero-de-deputadas-
federais-e-estaduais-aumenta-mas-ainda-e-bem-baixo/) — they still only make up
15 percent of the total number of seats — and many have pledged to beef up the
opposition to Bolsonaro.

One of them is [Joênia
Wapixana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joênia_Wapixana), elected federal
deputy by the center-left, environment-friendly Rede party. She is the second
indigenous person to ever be elected to the National Congress and the first
indigenous woman to ever become a lawyer in Brazil.

Also elected federal deputy, Taliria Petrone is a black feminist professor and
activist who was a childhood friend, fellow city councilor and party member of
Marielle Franco, the Rio de Janeiro politician assassinated in March. In the
wake of Marielle's murder, which remains unresolved, Talita was [subject to
death threats](https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-
noticias/bbc/2018/03/21/irma-de-vida-de-marielle-e-ameacada-de-morte-a-
vereadora-mais-votada-de-niteroi.htm).

They will join [Tabata Amaral](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabata_Amaral),
whose journey from the outskirts of São Paulo to Harvard as a double major
honors graduate in astrophysics and political science has inspired many girls
in Brazil. At only 24, Tabata is the founder of a national education movement
that aims to involve secondary schools students in politics. She was elected
federal deputy.

[Fernanda Melchionna](https://fernandapsol.com.br/queme/), a former city
councilor at the southern city of Porto Alegre, is also poised for a seat at
the Chamber of Deputies. In 2012, she made an [unforgettable
speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKzCxVOkOiA) at the local legislature
after her male colleagues tried to lecture her on her outfit choices.

### **Football democracy**

Few people seem to know this, but the first backers of the
[#NotHim](https://globalvoices.org/2018/10/02/brazilian-women-rise-up-against-
leading-presidential-candidate-jair-bolsonaro/) (#EleNão) movement were
[football fans](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2018/09/19/torcidas-de-
futebol-se-unem-por-democracia-no-esporte-e-no-pais/). They began [rallying
behind it](https://www.nexojornal.com.br/expresso/2018/09/21/O-futebol-na-
eleição-Bolsonaro-jogadores-e-torcida) in September, following a couple of big
Bolsonaro endorsements by famous football players and after some fans echoed
the army captain's homophobic rants in stadiums.

It was around the same time that one of Brazil's largest football fans
associations, “Gaviões da Fiel”, took an official stand against Bolsonaro.
Their club Corinthians, from the city of São Paulo, has a history of
resistance: its players led a pro-democracy movement at the height of Brazil's
military rule in the 1970s called Corinthians Democracy. When Brazil
transitioned to a democracy in the mid-1980s, the movement was a pioneer in
advocating for amnesty to all political prisoners.

“Gaviões” note about Bolsonaro — which laid the ground for other football
associations who followed suit soon thereafter —
[said](http://www.gavioes.com.br/nota-oficial-posicao-dos-gavioes-da-fiel-
sobre-candidato-antidemocratico/):

> É importante deixar claro a incoerência que há em um Gavião apoiar um
> candidato que não apenas é favorável à ditadura militar, pela qual nascemos
> nos opondo, mas que ainda elogia e homenageia publicamente torturadores, que
> facilmente poderiam ter sido os algozes de nossos fundadores.

> It is important to underline the incoherence of a “Gavião” who supports a
> candidate who not only speaks in favor of the military dictatorship, which
> we were born opposing, but who still praises and publicly honors torturers
> who could easily have been the executioners of our founding members.

**Book party**

While Bolsonaro is a former army captain, his defeated opponent [Haddad is a
philosophy
professor](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/10/28/politica/1540756297_108175.html).
In his honor, his supporters cast their votes on October 28 while carrying
books.

### **Holding hands **

After Bolsonaro's victory was confirmed, an image began to circulate on social
media. It says “no one lets go of anyone's hand”.

Tattoo artist Thereza Nardelli drew the poster just a few weeks before the
vote. To [website G1](https://g1.globo.com/mg/minas-
gerais/eleicoes/2018/noticia/2018/10/29/ninguem-solta-a-mao-de-ninguem-
desenho-que-viralizou-no-pais-e-criacao-de-mineira.ghtml), she said that the
inspiration came from something her mother used to say:

> A gente atravessava um momento difícil na nossa vida pessoal, mas o país
> também passava por dificuldades. Aí ela virou para mim e disse, ‘ninguém
> solta a mão de ninguém’.

> We were going through a difficult time in our personal lives, but the
> country was also going through difficulties. Then she turned to me and said:
> no one lets go of anyone's hand.

> Seguiremos juntos e juntas!
