For centuries, tattooing has been an integral part of life for the indigenous
[Tharu people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharu_people) living in the
southern plains of Nepal. Now, as the Tharu people face modernization, the
tattooing practice is losing its importance among younger generations.

Tharu women [wear tattoos](http://tharuculture.blogspot.com/2012/02/wear-
tattoos-they-will-accompany-you-to.html) on their arms, legs, and chests as a
beautification practice. The tattoos, called _khodna_ and _godna_ in the Tharu
language, are inspired by nature. The most common tattoo motifs are lines,
dots, crosses and other various natural elements.

The names of the tattoo patterns echo their natural counterparts: _badam
butta_ (groundnut shrub), _suruj ke daali_ (rays of the sun), _thakari mutha_
(a handful of hair combing materials), _supari ke gachh_ (betelnut palm), and
_majur_ (peacock) among others.

Traditionally, young women could decide to wear tattoos as permanent jewelry,
whereas all married women must have compulsory tattoos on their legs applied
prior to marrying, typically in the month of March during the wedding season
(the months of Falgun-Chaitra in the Bikram Sambat calendar). Today, however,
neither the married nor the young Tharu girls choose to wear tattoos.

In â€˜[Tatooing Among the Tharus of Dang Deokhuri, Far Western
Nepal](http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/contributions/pdf/CNAS_02_01_08.pdf)â€™
a paper published in 1975, researcher D.P. Rajaure captures the aesthetic
essence of tattooing among the Tharu:

> The main reason for tattooing among these Tharus is aesthetic. According to
> them, young and unmarried girls do not need and hence do not have to
> decorate themselves by tattooing because their bright and colourful
> _cholyas_ (a kind of blouse with its opening in the back) are beautiful and
> decorative; but a married woman has to get herself tattooed to compensate
> for the lack of beauty or decoration brought about by donning _jhulwa_ or
> _dainaha jhulwa_ , a kind of ladiesâ€™ shirt with full sleeves, double-
> breasted and opening in the front.
>
> The tattoos on the lower part of the legs generally represent _sitha_ (stick
> or straw), _chulha_ (stove) and _phunna_ (hanging motifs), whereas tattoos
> on the middle part represent _majur_ (peacock) and _sithas_ in between and
> tattoos on the top part of the legs represent a single peacock in the centre
> and some _phunna_ or other motifs on three sides of it, making a frame for a
> single peacock at the centre.

Traditional tattooing practices were painful and gruesome. _Tikaniya_
(tattooers in Tharu) used tattooing needles and natural black ink obtained
from the soot of a mustard lamp. The slow process sometimes caused
fainting.The artist rubbed the body part to be tattooed with cow dung and
later cleaned the area with water. After drying, mustard oil was applied to
soften the surface of the skin. The _tikaniya_ then marked the designs and
pricked the skin with tattooing needles.

One Tharu elder from Chitwan, Nepal recollects:

> In the old days, when girls of my age were young, a man from India would
> come and do these tattoos in our bodies. When my friend was being pierced, I
> could see tears in her eyes because of the pain and I remember being afraid
> as I was next. That night I couldn't sleep. The next day I asked my mother
> why I had to get the tattoo. She said, â€˜Who will marry a girl without a
> tattoo? No one will take you unless you have them.â€™

Aside from beautification, another key reason Tharu women tattooed themselves
was to avoid the attention of The Royal Nepalese, who hated tattoos associated
with tribal and indigenous peoples. Tharu tattoos prevented nobles from
abducting and keeping them as [sex
slaves](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4507432/Tharu-women-tattooed-
avoid-sex-salve-life.html).

Despite a rich tattooing history, Tharu youngsters do not get tattooed.
Experienced _tikaniyas_ are no longer found in the villages and younger
generations have not yet come forward to steer this age-old tradition.

However, as[ tattoos become increasingly more
fashionable](https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/events/nepals-tattoo-
scene-gets-bigger-better/) with safer, quicker and easier technology, it's
trendy now to document and post tattoo patterns worn by Tharu women elders
online, sparking a renewed interest in the art form.

Journalist and photographer â€˜[Travelinâ€™
Mick](http://www.travelinmick.com/TravelingMickWebsite/Biography.html),â€™
heavily tattooed himself, has been traveling and documenting the last
remaining tattoo cultures throughout the world for the last 15 years,
including Nepal. Here's a look at an array of intricate traditional tattoo
patterns that may fade into memory if the Tharu art of tattooing disappears:

Perhaps as young Tharu are reintroduced to the art of tattooing via social
media, incorporating new colors, designs and patterns inspired by traditional
designs may reignite this age-old tradition.
