The [Nepalese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Civil_War),
known popularly as the Maoist conflict, was a bloody 10-year armed conflict
between the [Communist Party of Nepal
(Maoist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Nepal_\(Maoist\)
"Communist Party of Nepal \(Maoist\)") and the [government of
Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nepal "Government of
Nepal") which saw forced disappearances, rape, torture, death, and the
displacement of thousands of Nepalese citizens.

To ensure that the victims of this violence won't be forgotten, an online
multimedia project called [Memory, Truth &
Justice](http://www.memorytruthjustice.com/) is documenting, archiving and
sharing personal stories of survivors and families of the victims who were
lost to the conflict.

### Remembrance and dignity

The mission of the Memory, Truth, and Justice project is “to preserve and
dignify their memories by recording testimonies from survivors and families of
the victims, and by sharing them with the community at large with a purpose of
education and remembrance.”

To do that, the project is sharing video, audio and photo testimonials from
around the country — paying homage to the memory of survivors, victims, and
the affected families.

For Hemraj Tharu and many others from [Bardiya
district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardiya_District) in midwestern Nepal,
the Maoist insurgency in Nepal was a lose/lose situation of the worst kind.
Tharu was interrogated and tortured by the Nepalese Army on the suspicion of
aiding the Maoists, but he was also mercilessly beaten by the Maoists who left
him to die. Fortunately, he survived the ordeal — but he lost his hand.

Palsang, one of the hundreds of torture victims, is still scared of salt,
electric iron, electric wire – the items used to torture her.

Another testimonial tells the story of Krishna Ghising who wanted to go to
South Korea to earn money for a better future. After visiting his village in
[Dolakha district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolakha_District) to get a
passport made, he boarded a bus bound for the capital
[Kathmandu.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu) During the ride, an
explosion ripped through the bus, injuring his spinal cord and leaving him in
a wheelchair.

Other testimonials tell the stories of those who were left behind, like Ratna
Kumar Mali from [Lalitpur
district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalitpur_District,_Nepal) in Kathmandu
Valley. She has safely kept the Bible her son Baburaja used to recite with the
hope that one day he will return to claim it.

Ramkali Devi Tharu has kept the sickle that her husband Guru Prasad Kathariya
used to carry with him to the rice field. Sharmila Chaudhary from Dang
district still puts some food in a steel plate and bowl every day before
eating. She still hopes her son Jagi Ram Chaudhary, disappeared 16 years ago,
will come and join her.

Seeing packets of biscuits and noodles, Sapana Suwarnakar from [Gorkha
district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorkha_District) in the Western region
thinks there might be hidden letters from her brother who used to send letters
hidden in the packets from the Central Jail in Sundhara area of Kathmandu.

These are only some of the many stories related to the mass killings, enforced
disappearances, sexual violence, and torture during the 10-year armed conflict
which [killed 17,886, disappeared 1530, and disfigured and disabled 8,191
people](http://www.memorytruthjustice.com/).

In early October 2018, the project
[exhibited](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-10-05/new-exhibition-
documents.html) audio-visual stories and memorabilia of the survivors and
families of victims in Kathmandu:

A room of a young woman who was raped and killed by armed forces brought tears
to many visitors’ eyes:
