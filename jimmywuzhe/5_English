During the four-day training, members of the Ginggang mountains tour dressed

A group of 60 employees from several Macau casinos took a four-day “patriotism
training course” last week in the [Jinggang
Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinggang_Mountains), considered to be
the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party’s Red Army. The trip was
coordinated by Beijing's representative in Macau, which is a special
administrative region of China with a high degree of autonomy, and was meant
to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the [Long
March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March), a military retreat by the
Red Army during the Chinese Civil War.

The casinos publicized the training course, but their odd show of patriotism
was not well received — at home or on the mainland.

The course is offered by a school called China Executive Leadership Academy,
whose major clients are from the corporate sector. Every year, the school
gives about 30,000 certificates to graduates of the course, which is composed
of a series of site visits, hiking, seminars about the revolutionary history
of the Chinese Communist Party.

shared their patriotic education experience with the public in a press
conference. Tour leader Daniel Fok said he expected participants would bring
the spirit of the Chinese revolution, meaning solidarity and the will to
victory, back to their personal and professional lives in Macao and spread it
like “starting a prairie fire with a single spark” — a popular quote from late
Chinese leader Chairman Mao.

While the restoration of so-called red culture has become part of the agenda
of today's Chinese Communist Party, casino representatives speaking in
communist revolutionary language is a rather strange sight, not to mention
that about half of the casinos are American and Australian owned.

Of course, Macau, a former Portuguese colony handed over to China in 1999,
could not have developed into the “Las Vegas of Asia” if the Chinese
government had not given a green light to the entrance of foreign casino
operators in 2003 and allowed millions of mainland Chinese gambling tourists
to visit. With the growth of the gaming industry, Macau’s gross domestic
product (GDP) jumped from US $7 billion in 2002 to US $55 billion in 2014, but
it has also become a [money laundering hub](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-
macau-crackdown-idUSKCN0QV07Q20150826) that facilitates the flight of capital
out of mainland China.

Mainland China's anti-graft campaign, which began in 2014, has had a negative
impact on Macau's casino revenue; Macau’s economy shrank 20% in 2015 and
[continued to contract in
2016](https://www.ft.com/content/d93339ef-8631-3719-bcd6-6753fa7b77d9). As the
city’s economy is vulnerable to Beijing’s policies, it might be that the
gaming sector sees pledges of loyalty like the patriotism training course as a
last resort to save the industry.

However, their efforts fell flat. Thus far, no Chinese state and communist
party media outlets have praised the casino trip to the Jinggang Mountains. A
commentary from Beijing News even criticized them for disturbing moral harmony
in mainland China and asked them [to stop paying
visits](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/opinion/2016/12/05/426028.html) to the
revolutionary site:

Outside mainland China, on Facebook Hong Kong and Macau netizens took the
patriotism trip as a joke. Below is a selection of some random comments via
Facebook search:
