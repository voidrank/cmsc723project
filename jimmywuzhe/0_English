Beginning this summer, the Indian government will controversially start
[requiring](http://www.livemint.com/Education/gwYKEGOkel6GqBVWAIiION/Govt-
makes-Aadhaar-a-must-for-midday-meal-at-schools.html) more than 100 million
school children to show their [Aadhaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar)
(national identity) card in order to claim their lunches.

Aadhaar is one of the world's largest biometric identification systems. As of
last month, 99 percent of adults in India — more than 1.1 billion people —
were enrolled in Aadhaar.

In a [press release](https://scroll.in/latest/830829/schoolchildren-will-no-
longer-get-their-midday-meals-unless-they-enrol-for-aadhaar-says-centre) on
Feb. 28, India's Human Resource Development Ministry said children at state
schools won't receive their free lunches unless they can provide their own
unique 12-digit Aadhaar ID number. The new policy is going into effect this
summer across the country, except in Jammu, Kashmir, Meghalaya, and Assam.

According to [the report](http://mhrd.gov.in/):

> And, [#aadhaar](https://twitter.com/hashtag/aadhaar?src=hash) made mandatory

The new policy will reportedly affect students between first and eighth grade.
After students have applied for their Aadhaar cards, while they're waiting to
receive the physical cards, they will be allowed to use “alternative
identity.”

Since 1995, the Indian national government has operated a [midday meal
scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midday_Meal_Scheme) in most states
across the country to help improve attendance and provide adequate nutrition
to potentially malnourished children from lower social
[strata](https://thewire.in/113838/aadhaar-mandatory-mid-day-meal-scheme/).

In 2015, India's apex court [ruled](http://www.business-
standard.com/article/current-affairs/aadhaar-can-t-be-mandatory-reiterates-
supreme-court-116092301015_1.html) that the government cannot make an Aadhaar
card a prerequisite for access to public services. Today, an appeal is pending
before the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court.

The government [says](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-number-
made-mandatory-for-students-to-receive-midday-meals/story-
xgI6gODyLidcQDHkZYRehP.html) the new policy is necessary to keep social
services “seamless”:

> The use of Aadhaar as identity document for delivery of services, benefits
> or subsidies simplifies the government delivery process and enables
> beneficiaries to get their entitlements directly and in a seamless manner.

On social media, critics have responded angrily to the new policy. For
example, P. K. Prachi wrote on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/prachi.kathale/posts/10212450530403120):

> Making the mid-day meal contingent on an Aadhaar number shows the government
> cares more about completing its database than filling empty stomachs.

On Twitter, critics have been vocal, as well.

policy “Orwellian.”

Some, however are defending the government. Twitter user “Don Toxique” said
tighter measures are needed “to plug leakages.”

Opposing the Indian government's move, campaigners from “[Right to
Food](http://www.righttofoodcampaign.in/)” issued a statement, which included
the following points:

Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian government has tried on
several occasions to mandate Aadhaar numbers in public schools, colleges, and
various state-subsidized programs. Despite the judiciary's opposition, Modi's
government presses ahead with its policy, putting it on a collision course
with the courts.
