A sample of some of the photos found on Twitter under the hashtag
#thisisthoughtful.

At the end of a year when across the world xenophobia and intolerance seem to
have prevailed, a ray of light is being cast over London by a sweet,
heartwarming project by [This is
Thoughtful](http://www.thisisthoughtful.com/thoughtful-contributors-sponsors-
home), a community of creatives whose work seeks to have positive social
impact.

Their latest, A Welcome Thought, does just that. They are spreading simple
welcome notes around town (London initially, though the initiative has quickly
gone international) as a way to reclaim public spaces from any unwelcoming
conversations, affirming instead a desire for inclusiveness and warmth.

This is how it works: Anyone interested can print out the template for the
notes ([found here](http://www.thisisthoughtful.com/wp-
content/uploads/2016/11/Thoughtful_instructions_final.pdf)). The outside of
the card has the words “A Place For” printed on it and a blank box for anyone
to add who or what they would like to welcome. Inside is space to write a
message to the person who finds the card. Students, friendly rivals, one-of-a-
kind moments, the homeless… So far, the place cards have been addressed to a
wide range of ideas and people.

Images of the place cards are popping up on social media too, with the
#thisisthoughtful hashtag.

It, indeed, is thoughtful. So far, hundreds cards have been disseminated
around the UK, the US, Canada, Germany, Greece and Spain, and the team hopes
that people will print out their own and join in their guerrilla welcome, and
that they will pass along the cards they find so as to reach as many people
and spaces as possible.

“We need to send a timely reminder that this planet is home to all of us, and
that to build a better future together every one of us has to feel we belong,”
explained Daianna Karaian, the founder of This is Thoughtful, in an email to
Global Voices.
