The account was established in 2016 and today has more than 93,000 followers.

In an interview with Global Voices using Twitter's Direct Message tool, the
account holder, who also runs an ecommerce site for anime fans, and who wishes
to remain anonymous, said they started the account due to their love of
everything Japan, an interest started in childhood: “It was traditional Edo
architecture and nature that attracted me to it. Then as I grew older, the
neon lights of Tokyo made me love it all over again.”

In the interview, the author was quick to state that these photos are not
their own. Instead, they curate the photos, which are sourced from Flickr,
Twitter or other sources.

The account often contrasts Japan's glittering nightlife and natural scenes to
show off various facets of the country. Night photos of Tokyo, Osaka, and
Kyoto feature prominently.
