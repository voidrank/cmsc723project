India marked the one-year anniversary in 2013 of the brutal rape of a young
university student, which plunged India into a period of self-reflection and
mourning whilst thousands took to the streets of Delhi in protest against
gender-based violence.

Debate has erupted once again in India surrounding the issue of rape in the
country, this time spurred by British director Leslee Udwin's documentary
‘[India's
Daughter](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b05534p0/storyville-20142015-19-indias-
daughter)‘ about the brutal gang rape and murder of aspiring physiotherapist
Jyoti Singh Pandey in 2012 in Delhi.

The film shows one of the convicted rapists, Mukesh Singh, saying women are
more responsible for rape than men, and that women shouldn't fight back when
being raped. Two defense lawyers who also appear in the documentary spew
similarly sexist and violent thoughts about women in India.

Before it was even shown, the film faced accusations of showing India in a bad
light, that it was made in poor taste or that it treated the issue
insensitively. Some even called it [fake](http://m.ibnlive.com/news/nirbhayas-
friend-who-was-with-her-on-the-fateful-night-calls-indias-daughter-a-fake-
film/533097-3-244.html).

The right-wing Bharatheeya Janata Party government, led by Prime Minister
Narendra Modi, stepped in and procured a court order banning its release in
India by citing “objectionable content”. Originally, the BBC had scheduled the
documentary to air on International Women's Day, March 8, but it [moved
forward](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/04/indias-daughter-bbc-
delhi-rape-documentary-uk-india-ban) the release to March 4 and published the
film in its entirety on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWwM3j6sx28). The Indian government
then [requested that YouTube block
access](http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/532286/youtube-blocks-access-to-bbc-
documentary-nirbhaya-in-india.html) to the film within the country, and the
site complied.

The documentary mainly focuses on Mukesh Singh, who is behind bars, sentenced
to be hanged for his role in Jyoti Singh Pandey's rape on a moving bus on
December 16, 2012. She succumbed to her injures two weeks later. It also
relies on interviews with her parents and the defense lawyers.

Criticism aside, questions were raised across social media as to why the
government would ban the documentary.

To protest the ban, popular news channel NDTV, which was supposed to air the
film, ran a black screen with the film's title during the hour-long slot on
March 8 when it was scheduled to air.

Explaining why the channel decided not to broadcast an alternative show,
editorial director Sonia Singh said in a tweet:

> We won't Shout but we will be Heard

Crimes against women are certainly a problem in India. [According to the
National Crime Record
Bureau](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/One-rape-
every-20-minutes-in-country/articleshow/22040599.cms), every 20 minutes, a
woman is raped in India. Since 2010, reported crimes against women, including
rape, have increased by 7.1 percent.

At the same time, the film isn't perfect. GV contributor [Annalisa
Merilli](http://qz.com/356299/no-jyoti-singh-is-not-indias-daughter/) pointed
out some of the basic flaws in the narrative of the documentary on news
website Quartz:

> The documentary lacks the strength to point to the roots of the problem.
> Take the title, India’s Daughter. Why? Isn’t that a quintessentially
> patriarchal label to give Jyoti Singh? She wasn’t India’s daughter. She was
> India’s promising medicine student. She was Delhi’s fierce citizen, who
> would stop a policeman from beating up the kid who just stole her purse. She
> was the fearless woman who stood up against the men who would then kill
> her—because she would not take being bullied, she would not just do as she
> were told.

Kunjila Mascillamani, a film student at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television
Institute in Kolkata, wrote on her
[blog](http://kunjilacinema.blogspot.in/2015/03/why-i-am-not-indias-
daughter.html) that while the film is not perfect, that's no reason for it to
be banned:

> Nothing artistic about it. Moreover it is somewhat like Slumdog Millionaire
> in that it looks at India as a third world nation sinking in poverty and
> anti-social activities. A country which needs reformation. Glee at an

Taking a look at the [conviction rate of
rape](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/25/rape-myths-low-
conviction-rate), India stands tall with an ‘impressive’ 24.2 percent (2012)
compared to the UK's 7 percent and Sweden's 10 percent. Then why does rape
continue to be a problem?

Gender inequality thrives in India, according to [Anjali Joshi in the
Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anjali-joshi/why-the-world-
needs-to-see-indias-daughter_b_6823390.html): “This is no pathogenic case of
victim-blaming. This mentality has been bred in Indian culture as a result of
generations of gender inequality. These rapists were not “rotten apples in the
barrel”; rather, their way of thinking is not far from the cultural norm in
India.”

Questions need to be asked at all levels of Indian society about how to rid
India of this gender inequality that has gripped its very roots. Where to
begin? Popular actress Twinkle Khanna tweeted in a few words on what needs to
be done as a society:

> It starts from aborting the girlchild to raping & killing women.We are
> raising tomorrow's men in our homes today.Raise them right India.
