The five young [women who were arrested by Chinese police ahead of the
International Women's Day](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/03/07/china-
harassment-international-womens-day-activists/) have now been missing for more
than one week. On 12 March they were criminally detained on suspicion of
“picking quarrels and provoking troubles” but the police refused to reveal
further information.

Civic groups in Hong Kong will protest to representatives of the mainland
Chinese government in the city on March 21 demanding their release.

The five women's rights activists are Wu Rongrong, Wei Tingting , Wang Man,
Zheng Churan and Li Tingting, also known as Li Maizi. Their families and
lawyers have been unable to reach them since their detention and police are
refusing to provide any details on their arrest.

Both the United States and the European Union have expressed concern on the
Five. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, criticized the
Chinese authorities for arresting the Five under the premise that they planned
to cause disturbances:

> In China speaking out against sexual harassment is “creating a disturbance.”
> Disturbance is restricting NGOs fighting for universal rights.

> Chinese authorities should immediately release “Beijing+20 five.” Sad

A spokesman for EU Foreign Affairs and Security Policy [also made a
statement](https://www.facebook.com/chinesefeminists/posts/432562206900532)
urging China to release the young feminists immediately and to give them
access to legal assistance.

Despite hostile political conditions, [women, students and workers’
organizations from mainland Chinese](http://libcom.org/blog/free-womens-day-
five-statements) continue to speak out for the release of the five by
uploading photos on social media and signing petitions.

And Chinese authorities are keeping track of the names on the petitions.

Outside China, feminist and civic groups from all over the world have
condemned the Chinese authorities’ brutal crackdown. Amnesty International has
launched a campaign page on [Tumblr](http://freethefive.tumblr.com/) and a
Twitter tag #FreeTheFive to collect supporting messages and pictures from all
over the world.

Ad hoc feminist group, Free Chinese Feminists, launched a [signature
campaign](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ref47cSyQWEQh154WKb8z__l05f2Uq0R-TIUYQTI-
yk/viewform?c=0&w=1) and a [postcard
campaign](https://www.facebook.com/chinesefeminists/posts/430525503770869).
The group urged supporters to send the postcard to Beijing police demanding
the release of the Five.

In Malaysia, a country with a large Chinese population, 26 organizations from
local civil society [co-
signed](https://www.facebook.com/chinesefeminists/posts/432562206900532) a
statement condemning the Chinese authorities and expressing concern over the
safety of the young feminists.

Taiwan feminist groups expressed their outrage over the arrest and [urged
their President Ma Ying
Jeou](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11a8mVAzxQh06NuQTWTDBGXfpduON4KDdkXxxYcJRepA/viewform?edit_requested=true)
to include issues related to human rights and gender equity onto the agenda of
the cross-strait dialogue.

Since Chinese authorities continue to play dumb amid criticism, a number of
civic groups in Hong Kong have decided to
[protest](https://www.facebook.com/events/822818634419975/) in front of the
Liaison Office of the Central People's Government and present a [statement
signed](https://www.facebook.com/events/892417467447737/) by 50 local civic
groups and 2,500 individuals on March 21.

Currently the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women is [taking
place at the United Nations Headquarters in New
York](http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw/csw59-2015) to review the challenges that
affect the implementation of the [Beijing Declaration and Platform for
Action](http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/pfa_e_final_web.pdf),
which stands for gender equality and female empowerment. The detention of the
five feminists in Beijing has now become a case study on the barriers to
achieving those aims.
