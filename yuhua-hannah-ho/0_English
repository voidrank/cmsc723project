For the last two and a half years, an online comics series featuring a young
female software engineer named Neta has been spotlighting the Macedonian tech
scene and encouraging women to enter the traditionally male-dominated field.

Neta is produced by Netcetera, an international IT company whose biggest
locations are in Zurich and Skopje. The script is written by the company's
staff, while the illustration is by renowned Macedonian comics artist
[Zlatko](https://www.pinterest.com/girov/)

The strips are available in [Macedonian](http://www.neta.mk/arhiva/) and
[English](http://www.neta.mk/archive/) on the website
[Neta.mk](http://www.neta.mk). In 2015, it received a [rave
review](https://www.it.mk/neta-mk-e-nova-it-devojka-koja-znae-kul-
programerski-shegi/) by leading local magazine It.com.mk, which deemed it
“fantastic”:

> Нацртан е одлично, и програмерските шеги се навистина кул. Тоа што ни се
> допаѓа е што Нета, очигледно, е женски лик, а на македонската програмерска
> сцена и требаат девојки, бидејќи требаат свежи и нови идеи. Можеби Нета ќе
> ги мотивира девојките да се заинтересираат за професија доминирана од машки
> гикови?

> Its artwork is excellent and the programmers’ jokes are really cool. What we
> particularly like is that the character of Neta is obviously female, and the
> Macedonian programming scene needs girls, because it needs fresh and new
> ideas. Maybe Neta will motivate young women to get interested in a
> profession dominated by male geeks?

Global Voices reached out to Neta's authors inquiring about their motives and
the impact of the comics. They replied:

> Целта на стрипот е да има локален, македонски стрип кој е креиран тука и го
> покрива IT светот во кој живееме. Уникатен е, не е копиран од интернет, се
> обидуваме за шегите да бидат што е можно пооригинални и да ја отсликуваат
> нашата секојдневна работа и да ги насмееме сите што работат во областа на
> информациските технологии. Од друга страна пак, би сакале со стрипот да ги
> охрабриме студентите да избираат инженерски факултети, особено да ги
> охрабриме и девојките кои навистина треба да се гордеат со своите успеси во
> избраната инженерска професија.

The comics do not contain straightforward advertising for the company, while
some episodes directly promote tech initiatives aimed at young people such as
the NASA Space Apps Challenge and programming competitions like the
[Macedonian CodeFu](http://codefu.mk/) (which is unrelated to [American
program](https://www.codefu.co/) of the same name; many thanks to Neta admin
for alerting us to our error) and the
[IEEEXtreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEEXtreme) hackaton. The character
of Neta has made an appearance or two at some of these events in the form of a
mascot or cut-out figure.

The authors say that even though “we have no way to measure the comics’ impact
[…] we enjoy creating it and we hope that the people from the IT sphere enjoy
reading it. We are happy to count every share on social media.”
