A truce has been reached between Israel and Hamas, ending a week of fighting
which cost the lives of at least 155 Palestinians and five Israelis.

The violence between Israel and Gaza flared after Israeli drones targeted and
killed a Hamas military chief on November 14, marking the start of cross-
border exchange of fire. Gaza militants fired rockets into Israel, which
bombarded Gaza from land, air and sea.

According to the ceasefire, brokered by Egypt, Israel will stop all
hostilities against Gaza, which will end “rocket attacks and all attacks along
the border.” If this truce holds for the next 24 hours, Israel would have to
start procedures to end the Gaza blockade by opening border crossings and
allowing the movement of people and goods.

Online, anticipation has been [building up

table/)for the declaration of a ceasefire.

**Who won?**

Egyptian Mostafa Hussein jokes:

> [@moftasa](https://twitter.com/moftasa/status/271339818255015936):
> Congratulations Bibi. You made Khamas stronger.

[Bibi is Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu and Khamas is the way many
Israelis pronounce Hamas]

Shadi Hamid tweets:

> [@shadihamid:](https://twitter.com/shadihamid/status/271342826573402112) So
> Hamas got: greater regional legitimacy, spike in popularity, end of
> assassinations, easing flow of goods into Gaza & a weaker PA to boot.

He continues:

Israeli Elizabeth Tsurkov says:

> [@Elizabeth](https://twitter.com/Elizrael/status/271339398996574208): Bibi
> kept talking about weakening Hamas and removing them from power for years,
> and this agreement solidifies their rule

Lauren E. Bohn, who is in Jerusalem, adds:

And journalist Gregg Carlstrom tweets:

> My Twitter feed variously informs me that the real winners today are Israel,

Praise for Egypt**

On Twitter, Palestinians heaped praise on Egypt, for its role in mediating a
ceasefire.

Yaser Alzaatreh writes [ar]:

> مصر رئيسا وحكومة وشعبا كانت معنا. وقفت دون تردد. صرخ الصهاينة ألما من
> وقفتها. عادت مصر إلينا وعدنا إليها، فهي قائدة العرب وعنوان عزتهم.

> [  
>  @YZaatreh](https://twitter.com/YZaatreh/status/271348048351854594): Egypt,
> its President and people, were with us. They did not hesitate in supporting
> us. Their stance hurt the Zionists. Egypt has returned to us and we have
> returned to it. Egypt is the leader of Arabs and the sign of their pride.

And, from Gaza, Ola Anan adds:

> من كل قلبي .. شكرا مصر :)

> [@olanan](https://twitter.com/olanan/status/271339731651022848): From the
> bottom of my heart, thank you Egypt!!

**What next?  
**  
For many, the ceasefire is a welcome relief.

Karen Knox, from Tel Aviv, tweets:

> [@KarenAbroad](https://twitter.com/KarenAbroad/status/271332330134716417):
> So thankful for #ceasefire tonight as I tuck my little girl into bed here in
> #TelAviv.

But many are left wondering how long the peace between Gaza and Israel will
last for.

Palestinian Hasan Karajah says:

> البعض سيذهبون لشرب نخب الانتصار بعد تعبهم في كتابة التغريدات و رجال المقاومة
> يكونوا في اجتماع الان لوضع خطة الضرب القادمة #المقاومة_مستمرة

> [@hasankarajah](https://twitter.com/hasankarajah/status/271348346982117376):
> Some will go to drink to victory after they got exhausted from writing

> a plan for the next strike. The resistance continues.

And, from Israel, Tsurkov adds:

> [@Elizrael](https://twitter.com/Elizrael/status/271348944242618368): In
