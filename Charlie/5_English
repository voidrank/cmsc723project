November 11 is [Bachelor's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor' data-
versionurl=) in mainland China. How do people celebrate this special day?
Apparently by spending money online – this year in a record breaking manner.

On November 11, 2012, China's top electronic commerce company Taobao reported
sales of 19.1 billion yuan (3.06 billion US dollars) in its [24-hour Double
Eleven online shopping
festival](http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/chn/chnpolitics/phoenixtv/20121111/16283949507.html)
[zh], which is more than twice of America's entire [Cyber
Monday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday) sales of USD 1.25 billion
in 2011.

**Bachelors’ Day Sales**

Taobao's Double Eleven Sales started last year and consumers now know that the
company will release big discount items at midnight, that's why users like
Poet with tears will get up at midnight to shop. But college girls, who are
mostly super Taobao fans, usually shop at Taobao all day long. That's why Poet
with tears’ question is amusing.

Poet with tears could be one of 10 million people who rushed into
[Tmall](http://www.tmall.com/) [zh], the retail arm of Taobao, in the first
minute of the event. In only half an hour, sales had hit USD 100 million.

The unexpected amount of transactions overloaded the payment system and people
found their screens froze. They then got very anxious when they had to keep
refreshing the frozen screens, as discussed in a

Not only consumers are affected, sellers were under network traffic pressure,
too. One seller, Mo Zi Kun (墨子坤),
[said](http://weibo.com/1416793974/z4K7sfDkr) [zh] on Sina Weibo:

As a result of the payment system's downtime, Mo Zi Kun did not have enough
stock to satisfy customers’ need and had to refund their payment. If he
received too many complaints, he would lose his trust credit and it may result
in the suspension of his seller account by the online platform.

**Online retail tactics**

[Seckilling](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=seckill) is a term
from video games, while in the online shopping world it vividly describes
fighting among buyers: you win or lose all in a matter of seconds. One click
and the deals are gone. Sellers advertise seckilling to attract page views and
visits.

For example one Taobao seller came up with the idea of asking her 72-year-old
grandfather to [model ladies’
dresses](http://shanghaiist.com/attachments/jamesgriffiths/grandfather-
model.png) in her store. It quickly became a hit. Some found it hilarious,
some a little weird.

Sina blogger Yunke Jia (贾运可)
[believed](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_66fe9ec90101ehgn.html) [zh] the
recording breaking sales in the Bachelor's Day is related to the “Diaosi
culture”, a culture similar to the Japanese’
“[Otaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku)“:

Diaosi are a group of people who deprecate themselves as “poor, incompetent
and ugly” in comparison to the “tall, rich and handsome”. They believe that
they will remain singles and the Bachelor's Day is their festival. There is a
strong sense of self-irony in the identification, in particular under the
context of China, the young rich is usually inherited from their family and
hence being a “Daosi” can be cool and honorable. That's why Jia believes that
Diaosi culture and Bachelor's Day are different sides of the same coin and
that Chinese merchants have been smart enough to convert their frustration
with the reality into business success.
