Brace yourself. The cyberwar is coming.

Since last week, when the world learned about
[PRISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_\(surveillance_program\)), a vast
and secret American electronic surveillance program, Russian state officials
have expressed renewed concerns about foreign social networks posing a
national security threat. One day after news of the U.S. program broke, on
June 7, 2013, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin
[told](http://ria.ru/society/20130607/942041898.html) [ru] reporters that
websites like Facebook and Twitter are elements of a larger American campaign
against Russia:

> Через них идет мощнейшая манипуляция общественным мнением, ведь всякие
> “лайки” и прочие кнопки, которые вы там нажимаете, моментально вводят вас в
> определенные группы, которые потом анализируются, систематизируются. […] Тем
> самым увеличивается количество тех людей, которые начинают получать
> специальную контентную информацию, подрывающую авторитет власти и ценности
> государства. […]

> Through them [American social networks], there’s a powerful, ongoing
> manipulation of public opinion—indeed, every “like” and every click
> instantly lands you in a certain group, which is then analyzed and
> classified. […] In doing so, rising is the number of people, who start
> receiving special content that undermines the authority and value of the
> state. […]

Just yesterday, June 11, in a [letter](http://izvestia.ru/news/551797) [ru] to
Rogozin and other security figures, Duma deputy Ilya Kostunov called for
tighter regulations on state officials’ Internet activity, based on the worry
that Russian bureaucrats commonly discuss or upload government secrets in
communications hosted on American websites (namely, Google’s email service,
Gmail). In an
[exchange](https://twitter.com/Kostunov/status/344190545943482368) [ru] on
Twitter, Kostunov discussed the possible implementation of his proposed
regulations, running into some disagreement about the need for additional
legislation and the proper criminal classification of uploading secret
materials to a foreign Web host.

Communications expert Petr Pervushkin
[argued](https://twitter.com/Pervushkin/status/344362999957569536) [ru] that a
closed virtual network for private communications has already existed in the
Russian government for seven years, though another Twitter user put that
[figure](https://twitter.com/michalin79/status/344372654519767040) [ru] closer
to four years. Just Russia party functionary Aleksandr Luchin noted that rules
are already in place to forbid discussing state secrets on Internet sites like
Google and Facebook, but
[acknowledged](https://twitter.com/luchinaleks/status/344190935699177472) [ru]
that regulations fail to set penalties. Luchin proposed tying such infractions
to the criminal codes against disclosing state secrets (though he didn't
[specify](https://twitter.com/luchinaleks/status/344325170913243136) [ru] if
he had in mind Article 283 or 284, which threaten maximum imprisonment up to
four and three years, respectively), whereas Kostunov has advocated equating
such behavior with treason (article 275), which carries a prison sentence up
to twenty years. (This push for classifying the offense under treason prompted
qz.com reporter Leo Mirani to [declare](http://qz.com/93623/prism-just-gave-
russia-a-great-excuse-to-step-up-its-war-on-social-networks/), perhaps
hyperbolically, that Russia is “stepping up its war on social networks.”)

Meanwhile, blogger and RuNet guru Anton Nosik
[claims](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/2525245.html) [ru] that station
management refused to air his recent appearance on OTR, Russia’s all-new
public broadcasting television channel, when during the recording he
criticized Rogozin’s comments about the supposed American cyberwar against
Russia. Nosik took part in an episode of the show “The Social Network,”
answering a series of RuNet-related questions that began with one about
Rogozin's remarks. After four days of silence following his visit to the
studio, Nosik took to LiveJournal for a second time to
[discuss](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/2526784.html) [ru] the curious
absence from OTR's [official website](http://otr-
online.ru/programmi/1266.html) [ru] of his appearance:

> Как я и предполагал, моё интервью […] не попал ни в их загадочный эфир, ни
> даже на сайт. Потому что, как выясняется, для этого супернезависимого
> телеканала неприкасаемыми фигурами являются не только Путин и Собянин, но и
> вице-премьер Рогозин. Самое время Общественному телевидению открывать
> программы про кошечек, собачек и кулинарию.

> As I expected, my interview […] has appeared nowhere in [the station’s]
> mysterious feed, or even on the website. Because, it turns out, for this
> super-independent TV channel, the untouchable figures aren’t limited to
> Putin and Sobyanin, but even include Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin. OTR
> might as well launch shows about kitties, doggies, and cooking.

Nosik doesn’t often respond to the hundreds of reader comments that follow his
blog posts, but one audience member did provoke a reaction, when he
[accused](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/2526784.html?thread=185939008#t185939008)
[ru] Nosik of adopting an approach “inappropriate to television,” arguing that
he attacked Rogozin too early in the broadcast, without “nuance” or first
establishing the context of his criticism. Nosik [wrote
back](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/2526784.html?thread=185949504#t185949504)
[ru] to say that he’s never encountered such problems in the hundreds of
interviews he’s granted to other TV channels over the past twenty years.

While it’s true that OTR has yet to air or even post to its website Nosik’s
segment, his thirteen-minute interview is accessible on OTR’s official YouTube
channel (see above). The station’s troubles with Nosik come the same week as
[another censorship scandal](http://lenta.ru/news/2013/06/08/joke/) [ru]
surrounding a different unaired episode of “The Social Network,” wherein hosts
Vladislav Sorokin and Ekaterina Voronina poked fun at Vladimir Putin’s recent
divorce, sharing mashable.com’s [faux dating
profile](http://mashable.com/2013/06/06/vladimir-putin-divorce/) for Russia’s
now-single head-of-state. When the station declined to telecast the episode
[“for technical reasons”](http://lenta.ru/news/2013/06/08/nojoke/) [ru],
Sorokin and Voronina [announced on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vlad.sorokin/posts/679100952106478) [ru]
that they would resign from the show at the end of the month.
