On November 21, 2012, Vugar Huseynzade, a 21-year-old university graduate
whose favourite past-time is playing the computer game [Football
Manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager) was confirmed as the
new manager for [Azerbaijan side FC Baku's reserve
team](http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/student-lands-job-
running-football-team-thanks-football-140446068.html). In an unprecedented
move this gamer pipped former footballers including Frenchman Jean Pierre
Papin to secure the job.

But is this 21-year-old up to the task?
