Delhi, with its dubious distinction as the ‘[rape
capital](http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Sheila-Dikshit-
hates-rape-capital-tag-for-Delhi/Article1-979270.aspx)’ has witnessed another
tragedy of sexual violence on a 23 year old woman (see [Global Voices
report](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/12/18/delhi-gang-rape-case-evokes-
rage-across-india/)), that has led to[ wide spread
protests](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/waves-of-protest-slam-raisina-
hill/article4228699.ece) in and around the capital and the country. Shocked at
the brutality of the recent violence, people from many spheres are asking for
stricter laws and harsher punishments and there has been vigorous debates
going on about capital punishment for rapists, [started out by
a](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U32KlaW6pV8) member of Parliament, Sushma
Swaraj.

The issue of the current debate on rape and capital punishments is a complex
one. The National Bureau of Crime in India reports [staggering
numbers](http://ncrb.nic.in/cii2010/cii-2010/Chapter%205.pdf) of gender
violence. This same year a two year old girl [Baby
Falak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Falak) died due to injuries from
abuse in Delhi. In India gender violence manifests in many forms from female
feticide, [ragging](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Suspended-
SRFTI-students-leave-hostel/articleshow/17459090.cms), eve teasing, dowry,
rape (some of it is considered a norm in the society). India’s north eastern
state Manipur has witnessed rape by its own army men and Manipuri women
protesting with the banner, “[Indian Army: Rape
Us](http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/in-manipur-women-take-the-
lead/).” Among its parliament members, [369 faces
charges](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/lawmakers-369-face-charges-of-rape-
crimes-against-women/20121221.htm) for crime against women.

With such complexities as a society and such widespread abuse prevalent, the
social media with its new found voice, has started [massive
campaigns](https://www.facebook.com/events/120378174795019/), and the debate
of Capital Punishment also rages including [online
petitions](http://www.causes.com/causes/807060-delhi-bus-gangrape-demand-

[Stalin K

criticises a newspaper (Times of India) advertising for Capital Punishment,

> The ad unfortunately perpetuates the notion that a woman's life is finished
> (‘takes away a woman's life’) when she is raped! The severe social stigma
> attached to rape, promoted by ads and arguments like these, are singularly
> responsible for women committing (or attempting to commit) suicide.

reasons with the staggering numbers in Delhi alone:

> We've been through all of these discussions earlier haven't we? This isn't
> the first rape case Delhi/India has seen. 600+ and counting in Delhi alone!
> How many punished? We demand death penalty because there is need for

comments on a Google Plus discussing the pros and cons of Capital Punishment:

> നിലവിലുള്ള ശിക്ഷയേക്കാൾ കൂടുതലായി വധശിക്ഷ ഒരു ഡിറ്ററന്റാകുമോ എന്ന കാര്യവും
> സംശയമാണ്. അഥവാ അങ്ങിനെ വധശിക്ഷ കൊടുക്കാമെന്ന് തീരുമാനിച്ചാൽ തന്നെ ഇൻഡ്യയിൽ
> ഏതാണ്ട് നാൽപ്പതിനായിരത്തിലധികം ആളുകളെ ഇപ്പോ തന്നെ വധിക്കേണ്ടി വരും എന്ന്
> പറയപ്പെടുന്നു. അത് നടക്കുന്ന കാര്യമാണോ? അപ്പോൾ പിന്നെ ഈ
> കുറ്റകൃത്യത്തിലേക്കെത്തുന്നതിനു മുന്നെ അതെങ്ങനെ ഫലപ്രദമായി തടയാമെന്ന

answers to this recurring gender violence in India.
