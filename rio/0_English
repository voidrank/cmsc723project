The constitutional document of Hong Kong, the Basic Law which took effect on
July 1 1997 upon the handover of the colony from United Kingdom to the People
Republic of China (PRC). The Basic Law is designed to ensure the city's
economic and political autonomy. However, as the interpretative power is under
the control of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the
PRC, the document has failed to serve the interest of Hong Kong people. In the
recent debate about the political reform package of the 2017 Chief Executive
election, the idea of citizen nomination has been interpreted by some pro-
Beijing politicians as against the Basic Law. Lam Shui Bun thus turns the
Basic Law into toilet paper in his political cartoon at inmediahk.net.
