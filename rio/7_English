Four years after the devastating
[earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_L%27Aquila_earthquake) that
hit L’ Aquila, in Abruzzo, Italy, little or nothing has been rebuilt and the
picturesque old town remains largely uninhabited, while many residents live in
[much debated](http://www.zazoom.it/blog/post.asp?id=7725) [it] _new towns_.
On May 5, 2013 almost a thousand art historians [rallied
together](http://www.iljournal.it/2013/laquila-non-puo-piu-aspettare/465230)
[it] in the historical center of L'Aquila to draw political attention. Despite
some intervention made by the Monti government, a much bigger effort is needed
to jump-start the reconstruction. The Italian comics activist Gianluca
Costantini summarized the issue through the series of pictures “[Yes we
camp](http://www.politicalcomics.info/yes-we-camp/)“.
