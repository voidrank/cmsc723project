[es] about the piece of legislations that seeks to extend the Law Against
Domestic Violence (Law 54) in Puerto Rico to same sex couples:

> Since our Supreme Court ruled that the Law of the Prevention and
> Intervention in Domestic Violence, known as Law 54, did not apply to same-
> sex couples, individuals and human rights groups have been waiting for the
> historic moment we are witnessing today.
>
> Finally, after ten long years, the legislator Luis Vega Ramos has filed a
> measure to clarify what for many people was clear since Law 54 was created:
> the protection of all victims of domestic violence, regardless of their
> sexual orientation, marital status and gender identity.
