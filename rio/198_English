A live broadcast by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on [July
4](https://twitter.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1148333360848220160) sparked an
online debate about child labor on the Brazilian internet. Bolsonaro does live
broadcasts through his social media channels every Thursday evening since he
took office in January 2019.

This time, the president mentioned that when he was around 9 or 10 years old,
he used to grind corn and crop bananas in his father's farm, emphasizing the
fact that it “didn’t do him any harm.” He also narrated how he learned to
drive tractors and use shotguns early in his life and wrapped up by declaring
that the only reason that he wouldn't introduce projects decriminalizing child
labor was “because he would be massacred for it.”

[Brazilian
law](https://www.chegadetrabalhoinfantil.org.br/noticias/materias/o-que-o-eca-
diz-sobre-o-trabalho-infantil/) dictates that any form of labor is forbidden
to children below the age of 13. By 14, children are allowed to work as
apprentices with restrictions to night shifts and hazardous occupations. Only
teenagers above the age of 16 are qualified to sign contracts.

Although the president affirmed he wasn't planning to propose changes to those
laws anytime soon, child labor nonetheless became a topic of discussion on
Brazilian social media over the past week following his remarks.

Federal judge Marcelo Bretas, who works on the [Car Wash
operation](https://globalvoices.org/2019/07/03/interview-with-the-intercepts-
leandro-demori-whose-team-of-reporters-challenged-brazils-anti-corruption-
probe/) in Rio de Janeiro, and is a declared Bolsonaro supporter, recounted
his own experience of working as a child on a reply to a thread started by the
president's son, federal deputy Eduardo Bolsonaro:

> Aos 12 anos de idade, em 1982, com minha CTPS assinada, comecei a trabalhar
> numa pequena loja da família.  
>  Tinha jornada e tarefas a cumprir, e aprendi desde cedo o valor de receber
> um salário (mínimo) após 1 mês de trabalho.  
>  Tenho muito orgulho disso!

Bia Kicis, a former federal prosecutor and currently a federal deputy with the
president's political party, also shared her memories:

Those experiences are considerably far from what the[ International Labour
Organization (ILO)](https://libguides.ilo.org/child-labour-en) defines as
“child labor.” According to ILO, child labor is the work that “deprives
children of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and that is
harmful to physical and mental development.” It adds that child labor refers
to work that “interferes with their schooling.”

### **Class and ignorance**

The [Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics](http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/direitos-
humanos/noticia/2019-06/mp-recebe-43-mil-denuncias-de-trabalho-infantil-por-
ano) (IBGE) says that there are currently 2,5 million children and teenagers,
between the ages of 5 and 17, working in the country. The Public Prosecutor's
Office says it receives around [43,000
complaints](http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/direitos-
humanos/noticia/2019-06/mp-recebe-43-mil-denuncias-de-trabalho-infantil-por-
ano) related to child labor every year.

Poverty is the leading cause of child labor, Brazilian [economist Monica de
Bolle](https://twitter.com/bollemdb/status/1148259626636468224) has said on a
popular Twitter thread. She says that, although working children help low-
income families to survive in the short term, in the long term it hinders the
country's productivity and economic growth, jeopardizing social development.

> Países que mais utilizam trabalho infantil tendem a ser os mais pobres do
> mundo, o que os prende em armadilha de pobreza e subdesenvolvimento.

> Countries that most use child labour tend to also be the poorest. [Child
> labour] traps them into poverty and underdevelopment.

De Bolle also maintains that, while in the short term child labor seems to
help decrease inequality, in the long run, it furthers it as it traps children
and adults in a cycle of poverty. There is also evidence, she notes, that
child and unpaid labour widen gender disparities.

The internet debate revealed that different social classes in Brazil have
different understandings of what “labor” means. The official Twitter account
of Tortura Nunca Mais (“torture never again” in Portuguese), a human rights
group formed after the end of the US-backed military dictatorship (1964-1985),
said:

> Os relatos orgulhosos de quem ‘trabalhou’ na infância tem em comum o detalhe
> de ter sido no negócio da família (a lojinha, a empresa do pai, etc.). O que

The misconception about child labor shared by a significant part of Brazilian
society stems from a lack of knowledge about its adverse effects, says
prosecutor Patrícia Sanfelici, who works with labor law, in an interview to
[news outlet UOL](https://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-
noticias/2019/07/06/fala-de-bolsonaro-sobre-trabalho-infantil-e-tudo-o-que-
combatemos-diz-mpt.htm?cmpid=copiaecola). Sanfelici coordinates the
Prosecutor's Office working group that combats child and teenage labor and
exploitation. She says:

> A alternativa adequada e justa para a criança será sempre a educação e o
> cuidado que ela merece. A gente não pode pensar de outro modo. A
> Constituição brasileira assegura proteção integral, absoluta e prioritária
