Imran Garda [identifies](http://africasacountry.com/9-signs-the-journalism-on-
africa-youve-just-encountered-is-trash/) nine signs of trash journalism on
Africa:

> You may already have accepted that those images of swollen potbellies
> underneath protruding ribs, those sticky flies sitting on the starving
> child’s eyebrows and lips, those panoramic views of refugee camps are not
> the be-all and end-all of Africa. Or those unclear references to Africa
> which suggest it’s a monolith, or even worse, a country. You may have
> accepted that all these, some of which are not inaccurate in some places,
> don’t provide the full picture. A picture which, if it were genuine, would
> reflect a continent of diverse peoples and ideas, varied standards of living
> (including horrendous poverty and unbelievable inequality) yet infinite
> potential, a picture of an eclectic mix of things good and bad.
>
> Besides flies, potbellies and continental monoliths, here are some other
> telltale signs of simplistic and often pathetic attempts to cover Africa. If
> more than one of these apply to your print, online or broadcast journalism
> source, you’re probably not getting your information from the most reliable
> place.
