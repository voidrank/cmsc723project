Yemeni blogger Noon Arabia writes an [open
letter](http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/opinion/noonarabia-open-letter-to-
president-obama_14865) to US President Barak Obama in which she says:

> All Yemenis are against terrorism and condemn Al-Qaeda, yet are also against
> the violent and unethical use of predator drones in combating them. We are
> against the death of civilians, whom you refer to as collateral damage in
> the war against terror. We are against the long-term effects on their
> communities and their lives. We are against any extrajudicial killings.
