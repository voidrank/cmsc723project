Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi [won his seat in the
parliament](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/25/pakistans-nawaz-sharif-
will-attend-narendra-modis-swearing-in/) by getting elected in the ancient
city of [Varanasi](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hindu2/2014/09/history-travel-
guide-varanasi-benares/), where he's now set to make good on a campaign
promise to transform the city into a blend of ancient culture and modern
technology.

Elected in May, Modi didn't waste any time before getting to work on
Varanasi's development. By August, he'd drawn up a
[blueprint](http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/varanasi-set-to-get-face-
lift-thanks-to-narendra-modi/article/394084) to make Varanasi into a modern-
day metropolis, complete with a transport system that includes rail and bus
services. Simultaneously, Modi has emphasized the need to preserve the city's
ancient heritage. Earlier this month, India signed an agreement with Japan to
help realize Modi's development plans.

Varanasi is several thousand years old, and is dedicated to the Hindu deity
[Lord Shiva](http://lordshiva.nishchala.org/). In ancient times, it was known
as [Kashi](http://sadhguru.org/atoz/k/kashi/). In the Hindu way of life, it is
one of the holiest cities on Earth. In fact, the word
“[Kashi](http://www.ishafoundation.org/blog/yoga-meditation/history-of-
yoga/kashi/)” means “city of light”, and several hundred temples are located
within the city's boundaries. The river Ganga, also considered holy by Hindus,
flows through Kashi, too. Many ascetics make the city their home, taking a dip
in the river every morning, before spending the day engaged in various
practices and rituals.

Author Rajiv Malhotra shared his thoughts about Modi’s plans with his Twitter
followers, who number more than 105,000:

> Reviving our sacred geographies starting with Kashi is great. Must also do

Malhotra wasn't the only Twitter user who felt this way. Someone else tweeted
almost two weeks earlier:

Not everyone supports Modi's plans in Varanasi, however. Ajay Rai (a member of
India's Congress Party, which opposes Modi in the parliament) posted a photo
of a protest against Varanasi’s chronic electricity shortages.

Opponents of Modi's plans for Varanasi won't have much time to stop him.
Earlier this month, the prime minister signed the [Kashi-Kyoto
protocol](http://www.allaboutbharat.org/post/news/kashi-kyoto-140831) on a
visit to Kyoto, a place renown for blending modern and ancient aesthetics to
create a beautiful cityscape.

On the second day of his trip to Japan, Modi stopped at the [Toji
temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8D-ji) (a UNESCO world heritage
site) and remarked at how well the temple is maintained. “Kyoto has been able
to preserve its thousand year legacy and cultural heritage while also staying
abreast of all technological advances that is necessary in today's life. We
are planning to do something similar in India as well, where we can achieve a
similar union between preservation of culture and technological progress,” he
[told](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/modi-lauds-kyoto-as-heritage-city-says-
india-plans-to-unite-culture-and-technology-too/495330-37-64.html) reporters.

The agreement with Tokyo will bring Japanese assistance with transforming
Varanasi into a “smart city,” complete with a world-class transport system,
botanical gardens, hi-tech cinemas, a classical music center, a waste
treatment plant, and other facilities.

Before the pact was even signed, Journalist Minhaz Merchant tweeted that
working with Japan will have dual significance for India:

> Varanasi-Kyoto cooperation agreement will get 2 projects up & running:
> modernising Kashi & kickstarting smart cities
>

Perhaps the time has come for India, with its millennia-old culture, to move
fully into the twenty-first century and embrace its rich past and promising
future simultaneously.
