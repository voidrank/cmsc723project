In 2011, Singapore placed a moratorium on mandatory death penalties for heroin
traffickers, but it [resumed](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-hangs-two-
convicted-drug-dealers-113705281.html) executions last year. Human rights
groups have [urged](http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=3158)
Singapore to reconsider its decision and join the majority of the world in
abolishing capital punishment.

Second Chances cites a 2009
[study](http://www.scribd.com/doc/29174962/Executions-Deterrence-and-Homicide-
A-Tale-of-Two-Cities) comparing homicide rates in Singapore and Hong Kong that
suggests the death penalty “is no more effective than alternative forms of
punishments.” The paper also notes “socioeconomic factors and the likelihood
of getting caught have more influence over crime than the severity of
punishment.” The group disputes the authorities’ claim that the death penalty
is an effective deterrent against crime, pointing out how capital punishment
makes even small offenses a matter of life and death, motivating criminals to
be more violent.

Priscilla Chia, the director of Second Chances,
[argued](http://secondchances.asia/reconsider-the-death-penalty-in-singapore/)
that alternative sentences can be used to punish criminals:

> While law is an expression of societal values, state-sanction murder is not
> the only way to express moral outrage at the conduct of murderers and drug
> traffickers. It can be expressed equally through alternative sentences such
> as life imprisonment.

The Singapore Working Group on the Death Penalty, a coalition that opposes the
death penalty law, [described](http://secondchances.asia/death-penalty-as-
life-saving-deterrent-fact-or-rhetoric/) its position on the issue:

> Singapore should not resort to the death penalty without concrete proof of
> its necessity, especially if alternative forms of punishment can have the
> same effect. The inevitability of human error within the system also makes
> the chances of wrongful executions far too high a cost for us to use capital
> punishment as an instrument of justice.

For its part, the government says the death penalty is working to discourage
crime.
