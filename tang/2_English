One of the “biggest Snowden stories yet” has arrived today, [according
to](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/568492138952056832) journalist Glenn
Greenwald.

Spies from the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) and the United
Kingdom's Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) “hacked into the
internal computer network of the largest manufacturer of SIM cards in the
world,[ stealing encryption keys used to protect the privacy of
cellphone](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/)
communications across the globe.” The information was obtained from top-secret
documents leaked by Edward Snowden.

So what, exactly, did the spy agencies do? According to [journalist Jeremy
Scahill](https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/568493259347111936) (who
also works for The Intercept with Greenwald):

> The NSA & GCHQ covertly stole millions of encryption keys used to protect

Encryption keys are what keep [encrypted
communications](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/what-encryption) private to
third parties, such as governments. In the case of mobile technology, the key
is [stored in the SIM card](http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~mricardo/08_09/cmov-
mieec/slides/security-3gpp.pdf) [pdf], and the mobile carrier also holds a
copy.

Communications are encrypted between the carrier and the phone only, meaning
that the mobile carrier can use their key to access your data. Typically, a
mobile carrier would only hand over the key if compelled to do so by law
enforcement. Therefore, by hacking into the network of Gemalto, the world's
largest SIM card manufacturer, the spy agencies are able to bypass the rule of
law and gain access to the SIM encryption keys of potentially billions of
mobile phone users, allowing them to decrypt phone calls, text messages, and
other traffic.*

On Twitter, many readers seemed unsurprised by the latest news, considering
all of the leaks that came before it.

@AnonyOps [questioned](https://twitter.com/AnonyOps/status/568562587371212800)
the efficacy of the hack, asking:

> It must be asked again, now that we know GCHQ/NSA have basically pwned
> everything: Why do we still have crime? How is ISIS even a thing?

Privacy International's Eric King joked:

> Who thinks it's a good idea to give Cameron a “golden key”, now we've
> learned spies have been able to steal millions of them in the past.

Another important question raised by the story is _who_ is affected by the
breach. As The Intercept points out, Gemalto's clients include US mobile
carriers AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint, as well as 450 wireless network
providers around the world.

“The company operates in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing
facilities,” they
[report](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/). The
piece also mentions Vodafone (Europe), Orange (France), EE (Europe), Royal KPN
(the Netherlands), China Unicom, NTT (Japan), and Chungwa Telecom (Taiwan), as
well as “scores of wireless network providers throughout Africa and the Middle
East.” A look at Gemalto's
[website](http://www.gemalto.com/companyinfo/partners) also unearths China
Mobile and [South Africa's
MTN](http://www.gemalto.com/press/Pages/news_708.aspx) as partners; the
company's [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemalto) shows telecom
clients in Turkey and Italy, as well.

Some readers expressed anger at the two countries for their seemingly endless
spying.

Gemalto, the company at the center of the story, has not yet responded
publicly, but a video from the manufacturer shows its good intentions:

*It's worth noting that this does _not_ allow NSA and GHCQ to access calls, messages, and other communications that are encrypted by other, additional means, such as tools like [RedPhone](https://whispersystems.org/) or [ChatSecure](https://guardianproject.info/).
