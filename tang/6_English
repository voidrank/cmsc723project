The creation of a new Ministry of Information Policy within the Ukrainian
government has caused widespread consternation among Ukrainians, leading some
to dub it the “Ministry of Truth.” Critics say the Orwellian department, aimed
at protecting Ukraine in the information war with Russia, will only hinder
freedom of speech and set a dangerous precedent, allowing the new government a
greater measure of control over Ukrainian media.

The new ministry is headed by Yuriy Stets, former head of the Information
Security Department of the National Guard of Ukraine. Previously, Stets was
chief producer of Channel 5, the TV channel still owned by President Petro
Poroshenko.

Media advocates and journalists are particularly worried that the new Ministry
is likely to inhibit the work of journalists, especially in war-torn eastern
Ukraine, where media access is already an issue, and many have been [speaking

censorship-deprecates-establishing-of-state-run-censorship-in-ukraine.html) on
social media and protesting in parliament against the new initiative.

Stets, the head of the new department, himself defended the need for the
ministry in a [Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/yura.stets.9/posts/906974439314177?pnref=story),
saying that information security was “one of the kay parameters of national
security,” and that many countries have been known to create similar offices
in times of crisis. His reasoning, however, did little to assuage the fears of
the ministry's critics.

Ukrainians have long wielded online ridicule as the most powerful weapon
against government oppression and injustice, and the situation around the
“Ministry of Truth” seems to be no different.

Suggesting the new ministry's creation is nothing but a misguided attempt to
address the outspoken criticism of the new government and its actions, users
have been creating fake “ministerial” accounts on social media. The Ministry
of Information Policy has already been creatively renamed as the “[Ministry of
Laziness and Spitting at the Ceiling](https://www.facebook.com/MinLinPluv)”
and the “[Ministry of Sexual
Politics](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Міністерство-сексуальної-політики-
України/960707660623619),” hinting at the uselessness of the new office and
the too-close connections between various government officials.

A Twitter account for the Ukrainian “[Ministry of
Magic](https://twitter.com/MagicUkraine)” exposed the new information security
initiative as a “magical solution” to the country's woes.

Another Twitter account, “[Ministry of Truth](https://twitter.com/minpravd),”
draws on the eponymous ministry in George Orwell's novel 1984, and comes with
a slogan “War is ATO [Anti-terrorist operation]. Svoboda [Freedom] is a party.
Nepotism is an HR policy,” echoing Orwell's “War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery.
Ignorance is Strength.”

The immediate and scathing reaction of the Ukrainian online public sphere to
the new government's “well-meaning” information protectionism seems to signal
that Ukrainians have become more vigilant when it comes to state initiatives
and will probably keep the authorities on their toes. If anything, Ukrainian
citizens have had ample opportunity to perfect the art of protest, as well as
the art of information warfare.
