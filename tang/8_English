South Korea is notorious for its highly competitive and grueling education
system, which [forces](http://www.bbc.com/news/education-25187993) young
children to study from early in the morning until late at night. The official
school day runs from just 8am until 4pm, but students typically leave campus
for “[hagwons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagwon),” private tutoring
institutes, where they continue studying until late at night (and sometimes
even into the morning hours).

In mid-August, South Korea's [Gyeonggi
Province](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province) decided to delay the
start of the school day by one hour, hoping to allow children [more
sleep](http://www.businesspost.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=3735). This
new “9am late-start system” has provoked a nationwide
[debate](http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/View/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002025724),
and several other provinces are now [considering
](http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/society/2014/09/15/0701000000AKR20140915148000055.HTML)similar
policies.

The response online has been divided. Some Koreans say the “reform” merely
restores school hours that used to be in place. Others have expressed concerns
that over-zealous parents will still find ways to abuse the news system,
presumably by finding new tutoring in the early morning hours.

The controversy about the later start time isn't entirely about students’
wellbeing, of course. Many of the worries have more to do with parents’ work
schedules than children's studying. Indeed, [according to one
survey](http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/2014/08/29/story_n_5734742.html?&ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067),
over 73 percent of students like the new change, while only 56 percent parents
are in favor.
