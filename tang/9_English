Myanmar authorities are
[reportedly](http://www.mizzimaburmese.com/2013-10-20-16-16-07/2013-11-01-01-48-27/item/28827-2014-09-26-13-24-51)
discussing the introduction of zones in Yangon and Mandalay — the country's
largest cities — in which women would be banned from buying alcohol. Although
2009 [World Health Organisation
statistics](http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11652-government-
parliament-abstain-from-proposed-alcohol-plan.html) suggest that Myanmar's
alcohol consumption is the lowest in South-East Asia, with only 1.5 percent of
women and 31 percent of men drinking, many
[claim](http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/special-features/168-food-and-
beverage/7436-are-young-men-drinking-too-much-beer.html) that this is now
changing.

Blogger Aung Htin Kyaw has
[written](http://viss.wordpress.com/2014/07/12/a-preface-of-sorts-examining-
alcohol-consumption-in-burma-and-beyond/) about the trend:

> As Burma opens its doors to the outside world, there seems to be a loosening
> of social mores. For instance, on social media, I’ve noticed a surge of
> Burmese youths (often around my age or younger), both friends and relatives
> alike, casually drinking alcohol in social settings.

Wagaung, commenting on Aung Htin Kyaw's
[post](http://viss.wordpress.com/2014/07/12/a-preface-of-sorts-examining-
alcohol-consumption-in-burma-and-beyond/), agreed:

> The consumer society — especially the conspicuous consumption seen on
> Facebook — inevitably encourages it so that you begin to see Burmese women,
> young and not so young, with a glass of wine in their hand almost like a
> status symbol or a fashion statement.

To date, only one Burmese-language newspaper has reported the proposals to ban
women from drinking in certain areas. Blogger MadyJune
[argues](http://madyjune.wordpress.com/2014/09/27/gender-discrimination-in-
myanmar/#more-1399) that the issue has not been presented fairly:

> Even before this news came out, local media has been targeting female
> drinkers by using the picture of women sitting at beer stations on news
> articles about the rise of alcohol consumption in the country.
>
> I’m not advocating for alcohol. In fact, I hate alcohol and I can’t stand
> the stench of it, but it’s not fair to limit women from drinking alcohol
> just because we are women. I believe we have the choice to choose whether we
> drink or not and nobody has the right to dictate [to] us.

According to the Women's League of Burma, men continue to dominate many
aspects of Burmese society. The OECD's 2012 Social Institutions and Gender
Index ranks gender equality in Myanmar as
[44th](http://genderindex.org/ranking) out of 102 non-OECD countries — around
the same level as Guinea-Bissau and Vietnam.

Despite disagreeing with the potential ban, MadyJune believes that few women
are likely to share her view:

> I doubt the entire female population in Myanmar will be outraged with this
> unfair prohibition. In fact, some of them (or the majority of them) might
> even support it.

In another post, Aung Htin Kyaw
[explains](http://viss.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/alcohol-in-the-theravada-
buddhist-context/) that abstaining from alcohol is a fundamental part of
Theravada Buddhists’ ethics, which holds that alcohol makes people more likely
to behave in a way that endangers other living beings.

The motivations for imposing restrictions specifically on women are unclear,
with most studies agreeing that men in Myanmar drink [significantly
more](http://aliran.com/thinking-allowed-online/2014-ta-online/myanmar-
paradox-alcohol-restriction-lack-awareness/) than women. Meanwhile, the fate
of the proposed zones remains uncertain: although the Minister of Health
[stated](http://http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6710:minister-
discusses-plans-to-control-alcohol-consumption&catid=44:national&Itemid=384)
that he was considering restrictions on alcohol consumption in July 2014,
[more recent reports]( http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-
news/11652-government-parliament-abstain-from-proposed-alcohol-plan.html)
suggest that many MPs do not see reforming alcohol laws as a priority.

Discussions about drinking habits highlight concerns about the growing
influence of Western culture in Myanmar's major cities. Even if the zones are
not introduced in Yangon and Mandalay, the mere suggestion that there should
be one rule for men and another for women shows that gender is becoming an
increasingly contentious issue in Myanmar's changing society.
