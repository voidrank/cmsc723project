After weeks of speculation, Saudi Arabia today [January 23, 2015] announced
the death of King Abdulla bin Abdulaziz, 90, the Custodian of the Two Holy
Mosques. Abdulla came to power in August 2005, after the death of his half-
brother Fahad bin Abdulaziz, and is now succeeded by his other brother Salman
bin Abdulaziz, who is 79. And their other brother Muqrin has been named Crown
Prince. They are all the sons of King Abdulaziz, who founded Saudi Arabia in
1932, and have been ascending the throne in succession over the years.
Abdulaziz had 45 sons of whom 36 survived to adulthood and had children of
their own. Egyptian Amro Ali shares this infographic which shows the “ever
shrinking old generations of Saudi kings in waiting.”

Online, citizens of the world were quick to share their two cents. Saudi
blogger Ahmed Al Omran notes how the now King Salman's bio on Twitter has
changed to reflect his new position:

There was also a confusion about the deceased King and his new successor's
ages. From the UAE, Abdulkhaleq Abdulla tweeted:

> Just in. 93 years old King Abdulla bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia has died.
> 82 years old Salman bin Abdulaziz is the new king. — Abdulkhaleq Abdulla

And many were not kind to news of Abdulla's dead. This Twitter user shared
this meme:

But there were also Saudis sad over their King's demise. This Twitter user
writes:

From Egypt, The Rock was quick to jump on the mouners bandwagon, thanking the
Saudi monarch for his services to Egypt:
