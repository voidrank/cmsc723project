On a Tuesday night, March 31, 2015, ten scholars came down from their ivory
towers to give lectures in ten pubs across central Hong Kong to audiences of
tipsy “students”.

The event is part of a worldwide initiative called “[Raising the
Bar](http://www.rtbevent.com/about/)“, which aims at making education a part
of popular urban culture. The goal, as stated on the campaign's website, is to
raise the bar on the quality of the content people consume in their daily
lives.

The event was started in New York City in 2014. Fifty academics gave lectures
in in fifty venues, ranging from coffee shops to pubs. One of the scholars was
Nobel laureate [Joseph
Stiglitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz), who talked about the
price of inequality. The initiative spread across the world and Hong Kong is
the first Asian city to host this event with [ten academics in ten venues on
one night](https://www.facebook.com/rtbeventhk/info?tab=page_info):

> We want to revolutionise how the city operates and interacts after sundown
> by embedding education as part of the city’s popular culture and changing
> the reputation and misconceptions of Hong Kong’s nightlife by raising the
> quality of content consumed daily.

With the slogan “Revolutionise the City,” it's no surprise that one of topics
of [the event's inaugural
program](https://www.facebook.com/rtbeventhk/photos/a.1587053491540849.1073741828.1553563331556532/1599275423651989/?type=1)
was “Long Live Revolution! As Seen in [Let the Bullets
Fly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Bullets_Fly)“. Dr. Kristof v.d.
Troost from the Chinese University of Hong Kong shared his thoughts on
revolution as depicted in the Chinese movie.

With one discussion devoted to revolution, other pub talks carried titles like
“Is the Free and Open Internet Dying?” (by Prof Lokman Tsui from the Chinese
University of Hong Kong), “Honour, Shame,and Empowerment: The Journey to
Equality for Victims of Domestic Violence” (by Prof. Puja Kapai from the
University of Hong Kong), “Translating Music: How Computational Learning
Explains the Way We Appreciate Music and Language” (by Prof. De Kai from the
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), and “Hong Kong Food Culture
in the Shadow of Gentrification” (by Jason Ng from the University of Hong
Kong).

Global Voices interviewed Elson Tong, one of the event's organizers, who
explained why the initiative is important to Hong Kong:

> Raising the Bar thrives in the context of a large number of grassroots
> public education initiatives recently launched in Hong Kong. Naturally,
> political events have been the main catalyst. Each initiative has its own
> focus, but they all respond to a growing awareness that the city has the
> potential to become a hub for culture, education and innovative ideas.
>
> Another important aspect is that we’ve brought the event from the grassroots
> level up, without a blueprint and without any funding. A lot of generous
> people have helped us out at different stages. In the end we’ve built
> ‘Raising the Bar’ around a ‘sustainable consumption’ model, where part of
> our revenue goes back to the local community, in particular local artists
> and designers.

Indeed, the organizers of Raising the Bar Hong Kong [have partnered
with](https://www.facebook.com/rtbeventhk) a number of NGOs and start-ups to
promote the event and build its community. Among the partner-organizations are
[EnrichHK](http://www.enrichhk.org/about-us/history-mission/), which aims to
enrich and empower migrant women in Hong Kong and improve their lives, and
[Project Little Dream](http://www.littledream.org/about-organization.php),
which is a charity that designs, builds, and runs rural village schools in
Takeo, Cambodia.

Professor Lokman Tsui, one of the speakers for Raising the Bar Hong Kong, told
Global Voices that he decided to participate because he believes education is
a public good and should not be confined to university classrooms.

> I believe that a healthy society is one where ideas can freely flow, where
> people can debate, discuss and learn from each other. I also believe
> education doesn't have to be formal or stiff, but can be engaging,
> empowering and enjoyable — so it wasn't a hard decision for me to accept
> when ‘Raising the Bar’ asked me.
>
> In the long run we need to start thinking of education as a conversation,
> rather than just a lecture. This is a cultural transformation, and something
> Raising the Bar is helping us realize and move forward on.

Louie, a participant at one of the talks, said he is ready to embrace this new
use of a familiar space:

> When I used to think about a pub, I think about drinking, picking up girls,
> and getting into a fight after getting drunk. I never imagined that a pub
> could be a place to have intellectual conversations.

It is events like this that make a truly dynamic and creative city stand out.
Hong Kong, despite the troubling news that recently filled the airwaves, is a
city that still shines at night with exciting ideas and inspiration,
especially from young people.
