[Rainforest Airforce: Indigenous Peoples Fly Drones to Protect their
Land](http://vimeo.com/106931036) from [GEORGI
TUSHEV](http://vimeo.com/user433827) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

Following a training conducted by the group [Tushevs
Aerials](http://www.tushevs.com/) in August 2014, indigenous leaders from the
Loreto and Madre de Dios regions in Peru are discovering how drones can play a
prominent role in monitoring environmental threats to the rainforest.

The workshops were held in the community of Saramuro located on the [Marañón
River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n_River) and brought
together 15 participants from various Amazonian communities, including members
of the [Embera-Wounaan ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embera-Wounaan)community
in Panama. The participants took part in sessions using flight simulators and
learned how to use software to plan flights using the autopilot feature. There
were also sessions on how to evaluate the data and create maps from the
photographs collected by the drone.

In this video created by the [Inter-Ethnic Association for the Development of
the Peruvian Jungle](http://www.aidesep.org.pe/) (AIDESEP for its initials in
Spanish), which was also the host of the workshop, community members say that
the drones will allow for more efficient and faster monitoring of potential
threats such as illegal logging and mining, as well as land invasions through
documentation.

Once the initial workshop ended, plans are being made for follow-up sessions
to take place in Panama in early 2015. These sessions will devote more time to
fine-tune their flying skills and how to better evaluate the data collected.
