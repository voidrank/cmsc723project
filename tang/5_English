The governments of Cuba and the United States want to rebuild diplomatic ties,
reestablish trade relations, and reopen lines of communication that have been
frozen for over fifty of years. The news is almost unreal, like a dream. But
we heard it today, from the leaders of both nations.

In a [live speech](http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/foreign-policy/cuba)
televised from the White House, Barack Obama described how the two governments
worked together over the last 18 months to negotiate the changes announced
today. On Cuban state television, in an address that was transcribed and
[published by Cubadebate](http://en.cubadebate.cu/news/2014/12/17/statement-
by-cuban-president/), Raul Castro thanked the Vatican and the government of
Canada for supporting the delicate process.

In the months ahead, the governments will establish embassies in each other's
countries. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who has [long
advocated](http://fpif.org/kerrys_cuba_sanity/) for normalizing US-Cuba
relations, will review Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror. Obama
indicated that this label, [disputed by many
experts](http://www.cfr.org/cuba/state-sponsors-cuba/p9359), is outdated in
the current global context.

Of course, Obama cannot unilaterally dismantle all US government policies
limiting contact and commerce with Cuba. As both leaders noted, the embargo is
codified in legislation that only the US Congress can change. With a
Republican majority in both houses of Congress, and a still-powerful
constituency of pro-embargo hardliners supporting key Cuban-American
legislators like [Marco Rubio](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/17/marco-
rubio-cuba-obama_n_6342348.html) and [Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileana_Ros-Lehtinen), this will be no
small feat.

### Political prisoners fly home

The two governments have already taken bold steps in this new direction. Both
presidents confirmed that US officials today released [three Cuban government
agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Five) who had been imprisoned in
the US since 2001, and that Cuba had released two US government employees, one
of whom had been in prison on the island for over two decades. The other
prisoner, US government contractor [Alan
Gross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Gross), was jailed in 2009 for
bringing large amounts of tech equipment into the country without a license.
Multiple mainstream media sources are also reporting that the Cuban government
plans to [release 53 prisoners of conscience](http://www.ibtimes.com/cuban-
policy-havana-release-53-political-prisoners-result-historic-us-cuba-
talks-1761549) in the coming weeks.

In contrast to Obama's relatively tempered announcement of the release of
Gross and the yet-unnamed intelligence agent, Castro's announcement was
impassioned.

> As Fidel promised on June 2001, when he said: “They shall return!” Gerardo,
> Ramon, and Antonio have arrived today to our homeland.
>
> The enormous joy of their families and of all our people, who have
> relentlessly fought for this goal, is shared by hundreds of solidarity
> committees and groups, governments, parliaments, organizations,
> institutions, and personalities, who for the last sixteen years have made
> tireless efforts demanding their release. We convey our deepest gratitude
> and commitment to all of them. President Obama’s decision deserves the
> respect and acknowledgement of our people.

Although their story has received scant coverage in US media, one can barely
walk the streets of Havana without seeing signs of the campaign to free “Los
Cinco Heroes”, as they are commonly known in Cuban parlance. The five men, all
working as counter terrorism agents for the Cuban government, sought to
infiltrate anti-Castro militant groups in the US and were [arrested in Miami
in 1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Five). They were later convicted
of conspiracy to commit espionage and acting as an agents of a foreign
government, among other charges. Although they originally faced sentences
ranging from life to 15 years behind bars, an in-depth appeals process has
since led to reduced sentences for three of the men, and the release of two,
one in 2011 and the other in February 2014. Today, they are all free.

Although little is known about the US intelligence agent who was released
today, [the story of US government contractor Alan
Gross](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/04/cuba-us-contractor-sentenced-
to-15-years-in-prison/) has been widely reported since he was arrested in 2009
for bringing technological equipment into the country. Gross made five trips
to Cuba on behalf of Development Alternatives International, a subcontractor
of USAID, on which he was assigned to set up small WiFi networks in the
country. Gross was convicted of traveling to the country without proper
permission and of acts that violated the “integrity of the Cuban state”. He
was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. He has since been viewed as a
bargaining chip in the notoriously tense dynamics between the two governments.

At the time of Gross's conviction, Cuban blogger [Iván García
quipped](http://translatingcuba.com/?p=8228),

> [t]he real enemy of the Castros is not Gross. The American is nothing more
> than a good currency of exchange. It’s not bad for negotiating with the
> Yankees. Or as a political show. Little more.

### Thawing isn't easy

Despite the explosion of media response and online commentary about this
historical shift, it will take many months for those closest to the situation
to interpret and put into political context what has happened today. What will
this mean for Cuba's future? How will it affect the Cuban Revolution, which
according to government workers and the majority of the Cuban population, is
still ongoing?

Castro's speech anticipated these questions and suggested that the transition
could in fact help support the system his party has worked so hard to preserve
since they came to power in 1959.

> The heroic Cuban people, in the wake of serious dangers, aggressions,
> adversities and sacrifices has proven to be faithful and will continue to be
> faithful to our ideals of independence and social justice. Strongly united
> throughout these 56 years of Revolution, we have kept our unswerving loyalty
> to those who died in defense of our principles since the beginning of our
> independence wars in 1868.
>
> Today, despite the difficulties, we have embarked on the task of updating
> our economic model in order to build a prosperous and sustainable Socialism.

Although Obama advocated for leaders on both sides to “leave behind the legacy
of both colonialism and communism,” it is not clear how this will play out in
practice, given that the Cuban government has shown no intention of letting go
of the latter. Obama also made clear that human rights concerns remain a high
priority for US policy towards Cuba. “The United States believes that no
Cubans should face harassment or arrest or beatings simply because they’re
exercising a universal right to have their voices heard,” he said.

Obama also noted US government intentions to continue “supporting civil
society” in Cuba, perhaps a tacit reference to US government “democracy
promotion” programs such as the one under which [Alan Gross was
hired](http://ellerybiddle.com/2011/03/08/development-alternatives-alan-
gross/).

It may be weeks or even months before Cubans themselves are able to see
clearly how these changes will affect their daily lives and the broader
trajectory of their country and society. Although I attempted to get quotes
and reactions on the news from our Cuban colleagues at Global Voices, most
said only that they were speechless, overwhelmed with emotion and surprise. We
look forward to highlighting more perspectives from Cubans on both sides of
the Florida Straits in the days and weeks to come.
