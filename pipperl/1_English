March 22 is Taiwan's presidential election held once every four years. The
victory finally is belonging to KMT's Ma Ying-jeou, who got 60 percent of
votes and 2 million votes than the other candidate, Frank Hsieh from
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). KMT lost its dominant political power
since DPP became the ruling party eight years ago. Now they are back and
complete the second-round transition of political power. After the election,
in addition to the brief reports written by Taiwan and international press
about the election result, bloggers in Taiwan carry on the discussion and
debate on democracy development, the performance of the two parties, and
relationship between Taiwan and China. Now, let us have a look at some of
their opinions:

**Democracy:**

_How_ [wrote a letter to his younger
brother](http://www.howsdesign.com/blog/2008/03/23/433
"http://www.howsdesign.com/blog/2008/03/23/433") [zh]. In the letter, he
described the generation differences among family members and how their
experience affected their attitudes towards the two presidential candidates.
After explaining the social and political context, he wish his brother can
understand the coming of a new democratic era marked by the transition of
political power form DDP to KMT. _Jill0718_ [also felt that this election
indicated Taiwan has reached a most civilized and democratic
environment](http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/jill0718-jill0718/article?mid=3671
"http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/jill0718-jill0718/article?mid=3671")[zh] among
Chinese communities. Even though the supporters’ candidate has lost, they were
frustrated, they shed tears and complained in the phone on TV call-in
programmes, on the second day, people were back to work and shopping as
normal. _MingWangX_ [shed tears listening to Frank Hsie's
remarks](http://blog.mingwangx.org/?p=565
"http://blog.mingwangx.org/?p=565")[zh] on his election failure:

> 選舉是我個人的失敗，不是台灣的失敗，今天不要為我哭泣，聚集我們的力量，繼續熱愛台灣。

This election is my personal failure, not Taiwan's failure. Don't cry for me.
Let's gather our strength and continue to love Taiwan.

_Annpo_ [is very proud of Taiwan's
success](http://blog.pixnet.net/annpo/post/15714354
"http://blog.pixnet.net/annpo/post/15714354")[zh] in democracy:

> 我 超級驕傲的啊，其實。老人家們可以毫無恐懼地談著他們的想法，可以輕鬆地面對選舉的結果，便可以感受到這個民主環境的正
> 向發展：包含一位非台灣出生的「外省人」在日漸本土化的現在還是被大多數選票接受，那麼，我們也可以期待未來台灣會出現「新台灣人」、「原住民」成為我們
> 的領導者，同時我們也可以開始省思：族群意識真的存在嗎？有必要嗎？我們也可以開始拒絕政客的分化、恐嚇與煽動。

Actually, I feel so proud. The elder generation can talk about their feelings
without fear and they can face the result of the election with such a ease. I
can feel that the democratic environment has been developing. This time a
mainlander born outside Taiwan can be accepted by the majority who are
identified with the local. In this vein, we can expect in the future, a “new
Taiwanese” or “aborigine” becoming our leader. We can also start to reflect
upon the existence of “ethnic consciousness”, whether such awareness is
necessary. We can say no to the divide, threat and agitation created by
politicians.

_Subing_ saw [the coming of media politics
era](http://blog.roodo.com/subing/archives/5749523.html
"http://blog.roodo.com/subing/archives/5749523.html")[zh] in Taiwan. A
touching speech or spectacular event can win more votes than substantial
performance. An inappropriate speech could bring about a disastrous result.
_VincentChang_ [pointed out
that](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/vincentchang&article_id=6037659
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/vincentchang&article_id=6037659")[zh] even though
people have changed the political environment by their votes, making society
from recession to improvement in the still heavily relies on people's watch,
not just media.

**Political Parties:**

The pictures are always different for the winners and losers after the
election. Although the KMT is very happy for their victory, bloggers have more
expectation on them. _Chet Baker_ [asked KMT a series of
questions](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/chetbaker&article_id=16850535
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/chetbaker&article_id=16850535")[zh], to know how
KMT will deal with these problems that DPP had faced in the past few years as
ruling party:

> 國民黨人終於將政權取回來，完全執政的美夢也終於在馬英九先生的身上落實。我們總算可以檢驗，國民黨能不能：
>
> 「在全球化的惡夢下，遏止貧富差距日漸擴張的悲劇」  
>  「在中國崛起的事實下，停止原物料價格飆漲的亂象」  
>  「在中國強大的陰影下，一方面抵禦中國的利誘與威脅，一方面維持台灣的主體性及參與國際政治事務的空間」
> 「如何在採認中國學歷的情況下，維持台灣諸多大學的競爭力」  
>  「如何抗拒三通的誘惑與壓力，同時又維持台灣的經濟實力」  
>  「如何有共同市場之實，但又無矮化台灣主權之疑慮」  
>  「如何讓中華民國與中華人民共和國平起平坐？甚至以中華民國之名義重返聯合國。」  
>  「如何在檢察官獨立追訴的體系下，建立一個完全廉能的政府」
>
> 過去八年，國民黨反覆攻擊民進黨這些問題。所以我在等著看，相信許多人也等著看。

Finally KMT takes the political power back. Mr. Ma has accomplished the dream
of being a complete politician with ruling power. Now we can examine if KMT
can:  
“Eliminating the tragedy of polarization between rich and poor under the
nightmare of globalization.”  
“Stopping the chaos in skyrocketing prices of raw materials under the rise of
China.”  
“In the shadow of a strong China, resisting temptations and threats from China
on the one hand, and maintaining the mainstay of Taiwan and the space for
participating international political affairs on the other.”  
“Maintaining the competitiveness of universities in Taiwan after admitting the
academic qualification from China.”  
“Resisting temptations and pressure on cross-strait direct transport, and keep
Taiwan's economic strength at the same time.”  
“Letting Taiwan join the common market with China without dwarfing Taiwan's
sovereignty”  
“Making the Republic of China (ROC) on an equal footing with the People's
Republic of China (PRC), and even return to the United Nations in name of
ROC.”  
“Establishing a completely clean government by the Prosecutor-independent
prosecution system.”

Over the past eight years, KMT repeatedly attacked DPP with the above set of
problems. Now I wait and see, and believe that many people wait and see, too.

_Subing_ wrote a long “[open letter for President-elect
Ma](http://blog.roodo.com/subing/archives/5742459.html
"http://blog.roodo.com/subing/archives/5742459.html")[zh]”, hoping he can
treat Taiwan and all people living on this land well, firmly sustain Taiwan's
sovereignty, don't be seduced by the immediate short-term economic interests
and sacrifice the long-term interests, implement transitional justice and
realize social justice. _Portnoy_ [hoped
that](http://www.bigsound.org/portnoy/weblog/004266.html
"http://www.bigsound.org/portnoy/weblog/004266.html")[zh] the new president
has the courage to reflect, the strength to resist the coercion of authority,
and the heart to be more tolerant on people and things.  
In _[the next four years, you must be
happy](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/ginciao&article_id=7113149
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/ginciao&article_id=7113149") [zh]_, _Ginciao_
doubted if Taiwan's economic problems would, as Mr. Ma said, be resolved soon
after he become the president. _Munch_
[worries](http://blog.yam.com/munch/article/14370643
"http://blog.yam.com/munch/article/14370643")[zh] the victory of KMT will make
those old-era-powers come back again after eight-years of hibernation.

In respond to the defeat of DDP, bloggers call for reflection and evaluation:

_[Tyc](http://blog.udn.com/tyc54/1721369
"http://blog.udn.com/tyc54/1721369")[zh]_ and
_[SpinalCord](http://blog.pixnet.net/SpinalCord/post/15688683
"http://blog.pixnet.net/SpinalCord/post/15688683")[zh]_ criticized DDP for
blaming others for its defeat rather than reflecting on its past.
[gaidhlig](http://blog.pixnet.net/gaidhlig/post/15670695) [zh] also agreed
that DDP should have self-reflection and give up the strategy of
“differentiation”, let everyone love Taiwan in their own voices.

> 「分別心」，只有拿掉分別心，才能真正看見彼此。不是挺民進黨才是挺台灣，不是投民進黨才是愛台灣。台灣是大家的，可以用各自的價值來愛台灣。

“Differentiation”, only by giving up differentiation we can then see each
other. Not only those vote for DDP love Taiwan, those who don't vote for DDP
also love Taiwan. Taiwan belongs to everyone, we can love Taiwan with our own
value.

_noorman_ [urged DDP to say goodbye to old
politics](http://nooorman.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post.html
"http://nooorman.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post.html")[zh] and not to use deep
green as its fundamental principle. _Naoshi_ , in _[DDP disappointed
Taiwanese](http://shangchihchen.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_22.html
"http://shangchihchen.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_22.html")[zh]_, also
urged DDP to reflect upon its past 8 years performance as a ruling party. He
suggested that the party should have a new generation of leaders. _Timo_
[criticized](http://blog.roodo.com/timojazz/archives/5750035.html
"http://blog.roodo.com/timojazz/archives/5750035.html")[zh] that DDP has
turned Taiwan into a pure symbol for getting votes, now Taiwan is getting back
its blood and flesh.

DDP's supporter _phopicking_ [evaluated the party's
defeat](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/phopicking&article_id=13375439
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/phopicking&article_id=13375439")[zh] and urged for
internal reform rather than waiting for the future possible failure of KMT:

> 民進黨要認清楚，現在就是要一切歸零開始去想。要回到沒有資源只能全省走透透辦演講的民進黨，要想辦法靠論述，靠你的想法與行動去感動台灣人的心。
> 最重要的是，就不要想說要是國民黨做的爛個四年，他一定會做的很爛…這種心態去思考。 要是要用台灣人民生活的苦痛去換民進黨的成長，這一世人撿角啦。
> 我們可以好好監督馬英九所開出來的支票有沒有兌現，可是民進黨在思考策略時，必需放棄馬英九執政失敗所以會讓你們重起的這個想法。
> 我也希望跟我一樣支持綠軍的朋友，在發言時可以思考這一點的不同。

DDP has to recognized that everything has to be back into zero. We have to
return to the old days when the party didn't have any resource. Our success
demands on our talks all over the province. We have to think deep about our
discourse, we have to touch people's heart by our action and thought. More
importantly, we shouldn't wait and see the poor performance of KMT in the
coming 4 years…. If the only way to make DPP improve is by making people in
Taiwan suffer (from the poor performance of KMT), then we shall fail… We can
monitor Ma Ying-jeou and check if he has failed his promise. However, DDP has
to give up the thought that the failure of Ma Ying-jeou would be the revival
of DDP. I hope that friends who support green army like me can consider such
difference in strategy.

**Relation with China:**

During the election campaign, the greatest difference between two candidates
was their attitude towards China and the future relation with China. _Wandeln_
[agreed](http://weimar1919.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_24.html
"http://weimar1919.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_24.html")[zh] that Ma
Yingjeou would bring changes to the across-strait relation, however, whether
such change would increase Taiwan's position in the international society is
still unclear.

> 國際社會是現實的，也是短視的。馬英九接 受一中各表，在台灣喊中華民國不等於中華人民共和國，但是在國際上，就是只有一個 China一個已經由將近全世界
> 包括聯合國承認的China。沒有人有興趣瞭解ROC和PRC有什麼不一樣，除了台灣和「在與台灣談判時的中國」。關起門來和強盜進行談判，會有什麼後果？未來在國際上，恐怕也只有中國的「賞賜」之下，才有可能增加生存的空間。

The international society is very realistic and short sighted. Ma Yingjeou
accepted the difference expressions of one China. “The Republic of China” is
not equal to “The People's Republic of China” in Taiwan. However, in the
international society , there is only one China being recognized by the whole
world, including the United Nation. Nobody is interested to know what is the
difference between ROC and PRC, except when Taiwan is negotiating with China.
What will happen if we negotiate with the robber with a close door? In the
future, I am afraid that only if China is kind enough to “give”, Taiwan can
have more space in the international world.

**Others:**

In addition to the comments on election result, Taiwan bloggers also have
other perspectives:

The election reminded _Sun Qiong-Li_ of [ election songs in the
past](http://www.blackdog.idv.tw/wordpress/index.php/2008/03/23/tomorrowillbebetterbutwho/
"http://www.blackdog.idv.tw/wordpress/index.php/2008/03/23/tomorrowillbebetterbutwho/")[zh],
the bloggers then analyzed the background and elements of those songs.
_Phopicking_ and _BillyPan_ [want to hold a “warm” party for the
netizens](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/phopicking&article_id=13377199
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/phopicking&article_id=13377199")[zh] for the
friends who support DPP so that they can comfort and cheer up each other.

_BillyPan_ discovered that the rate of votes is very closed to the ratio
google search results with the names of two candidates. He therefore
[concluded that google is an accurate predictor of voting
result](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/billypan101&article_id=11728661
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/billypan101&article_id=11728661")[zh].  
_PipperL_ [recorded the progress of vote numbers reported by different
press](http://blog.serv.idv.tw/2008/03/23/787/
"http://blog.serv.idv.tw/2008/03/23/787/")[zh], and discovered some
interesting phenomena at different points of time. _Yorkxin_ also [performed a
similar observation](http://chitsaou.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/2008-tw-
president-election/ "http://chitsaou.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/2008-tw-
president-election/")[zh]。

_Yeanhan_ [launched a ” nude-photos linking programme for the celebration of
victory”](http://www.wretch.cc/blog/yeanhan&article_id=8587986
"http://www.wretch.cc/blog/yeanhan&article_id=8587986")[zh], and let netizens
share their own nude photos for the celebration of victory. _Katejane_ , who
support DPP, also [launched a similar
programme](http://katejane12.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_26.html
"http://katejane12.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post_26.html")[zh] in order to
condole the defeat of DPP with nudity.
