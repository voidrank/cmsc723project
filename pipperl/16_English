Alejandro is a California-based Peruvian ~~Chef~~ who describes his [various
blogs](http://www2.blogger.com/profile/14811485462759971627) as “a bridge
between California, Peru, the world, myself, they are my prism.” He recently
returned to Peru, where he was able to visit the northeastern Amazon region
for the first time and captures some [pictures of local street
food](http://perufood.blogspot.com/2007/01/photos-amazonian-street-food.html)
for his mouth-watering _Peru Food_ weblog.

> delicious and refreshing. The yellow drink is made from the fruit of the
> aguaje palm, known in English as the [Moriche
