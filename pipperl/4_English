Kenyan citizen journalists and activists are increasingly turning to popular
Web 2.0 tools and applications such as wikis, blogs, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter
and mashups to organize and share news and information about the post election
crisis, chronicle violence, share crisis photos and raise funds to help the
needy.

**Mashups**

Kenyan Pundit wrote a post [asking for volunteers to create a
mashup](http://www.kenyanpundit.com/?p=406) to document violence and
destruction using [Google Maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps ):

> “Google Earth supposedly shows in great detail where the damage is being
> done on the ground. It occurs to me that it will be useful to keep a record
> of this, if one is thinking long-term. For the reconciliation process to
> occur at the local level the truth of what happened will first have to come
> out. Guys looking to do something – any techies out there willing to do a
> mashup of where the violence and destruction is occurring using Google
> Maps?”

White African [wrote about the same subject](http://whiteafrican.com/?p=842):

> Basically, you have an incident – that hopefully someone gets a picture or
> video of. A report on what happened and who was involved, and a location.
> That information is submitted and then populated into a map-based view that
> is easy to search by location and/or category.

[Ethan Zuckerman](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/01/09/digital-
activists-find-ways-to-help-kenya):

> One major concern in the aftermath of Kenya’s disputed elections has been
> the possibility that the media is undercounting the dead and injured in
> incidents of election violence. In a blog post last week, Ory Okolloh
> suggested a project to document incidents of violence and place them on a
> web-based map.  
>  The idea was quickly picked up by Kenyans in the country and in the
> diaspora, and over the weekend, Kenyan developer David Kobia put together

> Erik “Hash” Hersman and input from a wide range of Kenyan bloggers and
> activists.

Kenyan Pundit's call for a tool to chronicle acts of violence and destruction
resulted into [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com). [White
African](http://whiteafrican.com/?p=845) introduces
[Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/). Ushahidi means testimony in Swahili:

> Ushahidi.com is a tool for people who witness acts of violence in Kenya in
> these post-election times. You can report the incident that you have seen,
> and it will appear on a map-based view for others to see.  
>  At the beginning of a project like this the technology portion can seem to
> be the hardest to get off the ground. In the end, it’s just the tool, and
> the hard work will come from people in the field who are working with NGO’s
> to keep this information accurate and to chronicle as much of it as they
> can.

Alfajiri [commenting on
Ushahidi:](http://alfajiri.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/ushahidicom/)

> documenting and verifying the post-election violence from the ground up.

The tool [is evolving rapidly](http://whiteafrican.com/?p=857):

> There is continued refinement and improved functionality being added all the
> time. Here’s a quick rundown of what we’ve done and are doing.  
>  • You can now SMS your report to +447624802635 with your mobile phone.  
>  • You can email your reports and images to tips@ushahidi.com  
>  • We have added a “Peace Efforts” button to highlight the good things that
> are happening.  
>  • The “How you can help” page has started. The first is a way to send money
> via MamaMikes.com that will be distributed by the Kenyan Red Cross.  
>  • There are new buttons (with copy/paste code) for you to add to your
> websites on the about page.

In “Digital activists find ways to help Kenya,” [Ethan
writes](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/01/09/digital-activists-find-
ways-to-help-kenya):

> The rapid development of this application demonstrates a number of important
> points about the situation in Kenya, and about emergency situations in
> general:  
>  – Kenyan bloggers are watching the situation in their country closely, and
> their combination of passion and technical skill means that we’re likely to
> see innovative uses of technology to document the unfolding situation and
> provide assistance to those in need.  
>  – It’s still lots easier to create a web application quickly than an SMS
> application, even if the SMS application might be more appropriate. This is
> important for anyone concerned about applications for the developing world.
> While we all know that mobiles are the best platform (alongside radio) for
> reaching broad audiences, we need much better tools to build applications.  
>  – When a crisis is unfolding, people want to find ways to help, and will
> build tools online to help. We saw this in the wake of the Boxing Day
> tsunami, where activists in South Asia and around the world started a series
> of relief efforts around the SEA-EAT blog. We saw it again during Katrina,
> where teams around the world worked to create Peoplefinder, a database
> designed to help family members and friends find each other. And we’re
> seeing it in Kenya.

**Mobile Phones**  
[AfricaNews.com has been
experimenting](http://voicesofafrica.africanews.com/site/page/510:kenya) with
mobile phones [in reporting the Kenyan
crisis](http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/111/78/20824.html):

> With a media blackout in Kenya mobile phones played a vital role in covering
> the Kenya elections and now they are playing an even more important role in
> covering those elections bloody aftermath.
>
> AfricaNews.com makes use of internet-enabled mobile phones to report on the
> election crisis in Kenya. Local African journalist, with advanced mobile
> phone and a portable keyboard, collect text, photo and short video on the
> events in Kenya as they unfold. The reporters use their mobile phone to
> publish their reports to http://www.africanews.com. This is the first time
> the concept of a mobile journalist has been introduced in Africa.

In her post, [Technology for Advocacy in Kenyan
Crisis](http://www.blacklooks.org/2008/01/technology_for_advocay_in_kenyan_crisis.html),
Sokari writes about an activist using phone credits to distribute money:

> In an environment of fear and violence with many businesses closed and
> little or very expensive transport how do you communicate with friends and
> family? How do you send and receive money when banks and other financial
> businesses such as Western Union offices are closed? The simple answer is
> the ubiquitous mobile phone. One activist (for purposes of his personal
> safety we cannot mention his name) wrote how he was able to distribute a
> donation of money by purchasing phone credits and dispersing them to
> colleagues in need. One person in Eldoret needed money for transport, others
> could not get to a Western Union paypoint to receive funds and so on. He was
> then able to phone all of his colleagues and ensure they had cashed in their
> credits and were safe.

[Mashada,](http://www.mashada.com/) a Kenyan online forum, created an SMS
Hotline to allow Kenyans with no Internet access [to send news using their
mobile phones](http://inanafricanminute.blogspot.com/2008/01/blogs-sms-and-
kenyan-election.html):

> Soon after violence erupted, Mashada, a prominent online forum launched an
> SMS hotline to help share information. Further, several prominent Kenyan
> blogs are accepting comments via SMS.

At the same time, the Kenyan government was warning mobile phone users of
possible prosecution if [they use SMS to cause public
unrest:](http://www.afromusing.com/blog/2008/01/01/quick-update-from-eldoret-
rift-valley/)

> “The Ministry of Internal Security urges you to please desist from sending
> or forwarding any SMS that may cause public unrest. This may lead to your
> prosecution.”

Joshua reminds us of [the power and danger of
SMS:](http://inanafricanminute.blogspot.com/2008/01/blogs-sms-and-kenyan-
election.html)

> In Uganda last year, a protest against developing Mabira Forest was
> organized via mass SMS in Kampala and quickly turned violent and resulted in
> at least one death.

Crisis](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8563806021) is created to raise
awareness the situation in Kenya.
