Sun bin blogs the google map on the North Korea Nuclear test and summarizes
the [test information](http://sun-bin.blogspot.com/2006/10/north-korea-
nuclear-test-information.html).

In South Korea, there were much discussions in the blogsphere (although I can
only get access to English sources).

[Jodi](http://asiapages.wordpress.com/2006/10/10/observing-south-korean-
reactions-to-yesterdays-tests) observes her South Korean friends’ reactions
the test:

> Not surprisingly, however, was the idea that the real danger was not so much
> North Korea, but the United States who might react dangerously in reponse to
> the North. More than one person yesterday used the word “victim” to describe
> South Korea’s situation.

[Oranckay ](http://oranckay.net/blog/?p=1307)actually said that he was glad
that it happened:

> First of all, it either proves that both Roh and Bush have failed, and/or,
> the shenanigans are over and there is no more wondering. I was getting tired
> of the endless limbo, the endless effort spent by Roh’s government on trying
> to get the six party talks started again, as if the six party talks were
> getting anywhere. Perhaps I’m getting old, but I’m glad to see something
> happening.

[Timothy Savage has an anlysis in Ohmynews

in response to the right wing sentiment:

> The first victim, much to the delight of critics of engagement, is likely to
> be what remains of South Korea's Sunshine Policy. While often attacked as
> “appeasement,” the Sunshine Policy was in fact a well-intentioned but
> sometimes badly executed attempt to achieve slow-motion reunification by
> increasing Pyongyang's dependence on the South.

In Japan, [Alexpappas from Japundit
](http://japundit.com/archives/2006/10/10/3774)predicts that the test will
change Japan's foreign and military policy:

> North Korean boasts the fifth largest army in the world with an estimated
> 1.8 million standing armed personnel. If ever there was a threat to modern
> post-war Japan, this would be it…
>
> Today, all has once again changed and a new page of history is to be
> written. As Japan decides how to proceed with its now nuclear neighbour, it
> is certain that there will be difficult decisions made that will no doubt
> affect the world entire.

Japan citizen reporter, Lily Yulianti [reports people reactions in
Ohmynews](http://www.ohmynews.com/function/rss_ArticleView.asp?lng=eng&at_code=365351):

> On the trains, people carefully read Abe's explanations and looked at the
> graphics of the underground channel under a mountain in North Korea, where
> the test was reportedly conducted. People rushed to pick up the papers and
> ended up with similar comments: condemning North Korea's latest move. It was
> not only a headline in the media, but also the topic of the day on the
> streets.
>
> For many ordinary Japanese people, North Korean issues such as abductions
> and missile and nuclear programs are familiar enough. Despite a
> stereotypical judgment that says most Japanese people do not really care
> about politics and security issues, when it comes to North Korean issues, it
> is not difficult to find people on the streets who want to talk in detail.

In Mainland China, most of the discussion of the test happens in the forum,  
China citizen reporter, Wyan Hsu summarizes the discussion in ohmynews:
[N.Korean Civilians are the real
victims](http://www.ohmynews.com/function/rss_ArticleView.asp?lng=eng&at_code=365365):

> The test triggered criticism in China's cyberspace and I read several posts
> on a forum. Most say that North Korea's move doesn't conform to China's
> interests at all, and that it could even put China in a dilemma.
>
> They say that on the one hand China should work on non-proliferation over
> the peninsular and to be a more responsible partner of the international
> community, and on other hand it should cherish its traditional alliance with
> Kim's North Korea.

[Taison from kdnet (BBS forum) jokingly
says](http://club.cat898.com/newbbs/list.asp?boardid=1&page=1) that the China
government is really pissed off this time:

> 简直不给我面子，更何况，一直以来，全世界都知道金小弟的背后有我们罩着，这下可好，连大哥的话他都根本不听了，今后，人家其它国家又会怎么看我？

They don't give me face. Especially the fact that the whole world know that
little brother Kim has been back up by us. Now that he doesn't listen to big
brother, how will other countries look at me in the future?

In Taiwan, [Think alould in Talk Away's reacts more as a
onlooker](http://technorati.com/blogs/http%3A%2F%2Fjohannchiang.spaces.live.com):

> 北韓核示雖然讓人憂心，但東亞的執政者傳統上大都愛權愛命，核試只是種談判籌碼，就像我們阿扁台獨是喊爽的，不會真為像回教聖戰（伊朗倒是讓人比較擔心)…

Although the nuclear test is worrisome, in East Asia, most of the rulers love
power, nuclear test is just for political negotiation, which is similar to ah
Bian (Taiwan president)'s slogan of Taiwan independence. Of course it is
different from the Holy War of the Muslim (Iran is more worrisome in this
sense)…

[Raymondwoon, a Hong Kong
doctor,](http://raymondwoo.blogspot.com/2006/10/blog-post_09.html) feels
helpless:

> 我已經不慬得去分析各種政治勢力的對錯，當我聽到戰爭所帶來的哭聲以及地球因這核試所承受的震動，我內心和核爆的地土一樣痛楚…

I don't know how to analyze international politics any more. When I heard the
crying sounds from wars and shocking noises from this nuclear test, my heart
reacts in pain as the earth in the testing spot…
