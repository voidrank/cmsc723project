When Ghana's President John Kuffour handed the peace batton to former UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan, few people in Kenya had hope that there would be
breakthrough in the negotiations. That was a month ago, when the political
temparatures were so high and threatening to boil over to a full blown civil
war. Kenyans were scared and at the same time continued with the violence. It
was a contradiction.

But with a month of continued engagement, there is renewed confidence that
there will be a lasting peace deal. This confidence in the streets of Nairobi
is also reflected in the blogosphere.

Where Madness Resides [sums up what many people are
feeling](http://wherehermadnessresides.blogspot.com/2008/02/annan-ship.html)
about the soft spoken Annan:

> Right now, I'm loving Annan so much that it's threatening to become a cult.
> I love his grit and determination, his “I'm not ready to contemplate
> failure. I'm not ready to give up now.”
>
> Of all the people involved in this process, he's the only one I've been able
> to trust as not having come laden with a basketful of hidden agendas or
> worse still, having been lowered as a puppet into our circumstances by
> “vested interests.”
>
> I'm _the people_ , and I feel as though Annan is looking beyond the
> shenanigans of both sides of the political divide, that he sees me, and that
> he is using me as a true north, to navigate his way to the _Kenya That Ought
> To Be_ from this desolate place called _Kenya Today_.

[Kumekucha talks about the new
foundation](http://kumekucha.blogspot.com/2008/02/breakthrough-before-
deadlock.html) that the negotiations are laying:

> Kenyans are far ahead of their leaders and we must seize this opportunity to
> shape our country into what we want. That is no premature celebration for
> the far sighted by any means. It is time to lay the foundation for corporate
> leadership and banish deceptive and selfish rulership – the NARC dream
> reincarnated.
