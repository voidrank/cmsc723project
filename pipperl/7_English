[Sidr](http://rezwanul.blogspot.com/2007/11/cyclone-sidr-heading-towards-
bangladesh.html) is a category 4 Hurricane (deadlier than
[Katrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina)) raged its severest
onslaughts packing winds of 240 kph (150mph) on the southern coast of
Bangladesh from about 5:30pm Thursday to early Friday. Now it has weakened
into a tropical storm and is moving across the country to the northeastern
part into India.

Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated thanks to localized early
warning systems in place (using microphone canvassing, radio bulletins etc),
airports suspended flight operations and sea ports ceased operations. When the
Hurricane struck communications and electricity supplies were snapped across
the country. Most parts of the coastal region were virtually blacked out
during the night. The capital Dhaka had power and communications link cut off
as driving rains flooded some streets and strong winds sent billboards flying
through the air. Buildings and roofs were shaken by fierce winds during the
night, and that by morning power and water supplies had been cut. And these
were being updated by the countries 24 hour online news site

The Bangladeshi Blogosphere was keeping their eyes on the hurricane using the
many open source [satellite

emerged.

37 years ago the “[Bhola
Cyclone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone)” hit Bangladesh
(then East Pakistan), which was the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded,
and one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern times. Death toll
estimates range from 300,000 to as high as 500,000 because of a storm surge in
the low-lying delta and almost zero early warning system.

After the 1991 cyclone which left more than 140,000 dead TIME magazine's James
Walsh
[wrote](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972926,00.html?promoid=googlep):

“A world used to human-scale catastrophes — plane crashes, say, that kill a
few hundred at most — cannot absorb the biblical dooms that visit Bangladesh.
Of the 20th century’s 10 deadliest storms, seven have devoured their victims
at the head of the Bay of Bengal.”

But the aftermath of Sidr show signs of devastation but not much loss of
lives. _The 3rd world view_ has
[updates](http://rezwanul.blogspot.com/2007/11/aftermath-of-hurricane-sidr-
signs-of.html):

\- At least 250 people killed.

\- Hundreds of fishing boats caught in the cyclone failed to return to shore.
Red Crescent officials have said at least three villages were flattened by the
storm. Search and rescue efforts had been initiated by civilians, army and
police, and the casualty figures will rise.

Razib at the _Gene Expressions_
[asks](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/11/is_sidr_a_sign_of_progress.php) is
the low casualty a sign of progress?

> I repeat this litany to offer optimistic note: things are getting better!
> Bangladesh is a depressing kleptocracy, but it muddles along, and the arrow
> of progress is in a positive direction.

concluding this report with a [quote
from](http://rezwanul.blogspot.com/2007/11/aftermath-of-hurricane-sidr-signs-
of.html) _The 3rd world view_ :

> Facing the challenge of this mega cyclone Sidr and keeping the figures under
