As the Sudanese blogosphere [continues to
grow](http://www.sudanesethinker.com/2007/08/09/an-open-letter-to-the-
sudanese-blogosphere/), we're increasingly witnessing more activity and
hearing more diverse voices coming from it. Allow me to take you into its
recent conversations.

_Ayman Elkhidir_ , a Sudanese blogger residing in Dubai is on a holiday in
Sudan at the moment. He [blogs a
post](http://www.aymanelkhidir.com/blog/?p=118) expressing his disdain towards
the people's driving habits there:

> People in Sudan drive like they were riding their camels and donkeys a
> hundred years ago. There are absolutely no traffic rules. Priority at
> intersections is decided by who has a stronger guts. Even traffic lights,
> when found, are badly designed that if you follow them, you’ll definitely
> crash. To make that clear, imagine that both opposite lights for those going
> forwards and those turning left are green at the same time. So if you’re
> turning left or making a U turn, you should be prepared for the cars coming
> from the opposite side coz their way is clear as well.

A new Sudanese blogger named _SudanEase_ , [talks about the recent floods in
Sudan](http://sudanease.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/a-nation-under-fire-and-
water/):

> this August’s rain season in Sudan this year has turned out to be
> disasterous to the people of Sudan and the goverment who have droughted
> their own resources on several insignifcant issues such as the installment
> of a new currency. With limited resources and standing mostly alone to face
> this predicament the nation is failing to resist nature at its worst. The
> goverment helpless and under heavy criticism were forced to turn a blind
> eye. Up till now 67,731 houses were wrecked by the rains, of which 31,540
> were damaged beyond repair.

_Kizzie_ [came up with a random thought](http://wholeheartedly-
sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/08/random-thought.html) about the possible
separation of South Sudan:

> In about 4 years, the Sudan will no longer be Africa's largest country.

_[Daana](http://daana-lost-in-translation.blogspot.com/2007/08/kizzies-scary-
random-thought.html)_ found it saddening:

> I just read Kizzie's Random Thought, and it saddened me. Is that really
> where we are heading? Isn't there any hope at all?? Not even a glimpse? I
> don't think that we ever gave this country a chance to survive. From the
> time of British colonialism policies of separating the two parts of the
> country were strongly implemented, and ever since that time we have been
> distracted from working together to working against each other. Why didn't
> anybody try to give this country a chance to be?

After celebrating his [one year blogging
anniversary](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/08/black-kush-one-year-of-
blogging.html), _Black Kush_ [tells
us](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/08/new-hope-for-sami-el-haj.html) of
the [news](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article23295) of [Sami El-
Hajj's](http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510132006) possible release
from the Guantanamo prison:

> August 15, 2007 (KHARTOUM) — Washington has asked Khartoum for guarantees
> that detained Al Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Haj will not leave Sudan before
> it releases him from the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, his brother Asim al-Haj
> said on Wednesday.

[_Little.Miss.Dalu_](http://msdalu.blogspot.com/2007/08/damming-sudan.html)
puts the spotlight on the construction of a large dam in Sudan known as [the
Meroe Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merowe_Dam) and [the loss it will
cause to archaeological
treasures](http://www.archaeology.org/0611/abstracts/sudan.html) from the days
of the [ancient Nubian
Civilization](http://www.homestead.com/wysinger/nubian105.html):

> The Meroe Dam already poses a humanitarian crisis. It will displace more
> than 50,000 people who live along this isolated region of the Nile, growing
> dates and herding sheep and goats. But the project is also creating a
> cultural heritage disaster largely ignored by the international media,
> UNESCO, and private preservation groups. Thousands–perhaps tens of
> thousands–of ancient sites are likely to vanish underwater as early as next
> year without even cursory examination.

She's not happy about it:

> I pretty much am too frustrated/sad/helpless to make any intelligent
> commentary on this. :( As someone who is known to swear like a drunken
> sailor, I can't help but read the title of this article as “Damning the
> Sudan.”
