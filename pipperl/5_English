Not surprisingly, about a month ago the Sudanese blogosphere's main topic and
attraction was [the teddy bear
circus](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7112929.stm) which received a huge
amount of media attention.

_Drima, The Sudanese Thinker_ [found it
unbelievable](http://www.sudanesethinker.com/2007/11/27/mo-teddy-bear/):

> The whole thing is just so unbelievably pathetic. Clearly it’s an honest and
> innocent mistake. Oh no, how stupid can I be, she’s a white British infidel
> so it _must_ be a freaking Zionist Cr **USA** de and Jewish conspiracy.
> Right? _Raaaight!_
>
> … This isn’t the first time the school finds itself in the midst of a
> controversy, albeit one surely not as big as this. Back in the 90’s when
> beloved al-Turabi was still in power and his version of Sharia was being
> shoved down our throats, the school came under pressure to change the girl’s
> uniform. Many Islamists hated the fact that girls wore skirts and mixed with
> boys. Now we have this.

_Amjad_ was equally [critical and
shocked](http://amjad248.blogspot.com/2007/11/briton-faces-lashes-in-sudan-
over-teddy.html) at what he called “stupid”:

> Three words: This is ridiculous.
>
> How on earth would a British teacher know that naming the teddy bear
> Mohammed would insult our prophet, especially that 20 out of the 23 children
> CHOSE to name the teddy bear Mohammed and she wasn't the one naming it?
>
> Why are they assuming that the teddy bear was named after our prophet
> (PBUH)?
>
> This is really stupid! And they closed down the school till January just
> because of this! oh my god.. I really can't believe this.

_Kizzie, Wholeheartedly-Sudaniya_ clearly [wasn't
happy](http://wholeheartedly-sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/11/because-sudan-
doesnt-have-bigger.html):

> WHAT?!
>
> A British schoolteacher has been arrested in Sudan accused of insulting
> Islam's Prophet, after she allowed her pupils to name a teddy bear Muhammad.
>
> The police force doesn't have anything to go except arresting 54 year-old
> kind Gibbons!

_Black Kush_ wasn't pleased either and [wished the British teacher
well](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/12/teddy-bear-teacher-to-be-
freed.html):

> Go well, Mrs Gibbons. I hope you dont bear grudges against the Sudanese
> people. The ragtag group into whose hands you fell are a minority and does
> not represent us at all. I wish you well.

_Rara Avis_ [offered her
thoughts](http://raraavisrealm.blogspot.com/2007/11/conspiracy-theory-in-
unity-high-school.html) too and on a none related note, Sudanese blogger
_Path2Hope_ is now [studying in the United
Kingdom](http://path2hope.blogspot.com/2007/11/thoughts-of-insomniac.html):

> I must admit that no matter how much I abhor words like “deadline” and
> “assignments” there is something really refreshing about going back to
> student life. The solidarity that you feel with your classmates/colleagues
> transcends age and race and that’s truly something.
