There is quite a lot to cover in this week's round up of the Sudanese
blogosphere so let's get it started. We'll first start with some Sudanese
bloggers’ thoughts on recently released movies.

_[Ayman](http://www.aymanelkhidir.com/blog/?p=98)_ , a Sudanese blogger
residing in [Dubai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai) enjoyed the movie,
[Transformers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/), immensely:

> Wow wow wow wow…
>
> What a movie!
>
> Transformers is totally the movie of this summer. It’s two and a half hours
> of extreme visual graphics, amazing muscle cars (I loved the new Chevy
> Camaro), and marvelous action scenes.
>
> Totally recommended!

On the other hand,[ _Amjad_](http://amjad248.blogspot.com/2007/07/harry-
potter-fans-get-ready.html), who lives in
[Oman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman) [can't even be
bothered](http://amjad248.blogspot.com/2007/07/harry-potter-fans-get-
ready.html) about the latest Harry Potter movie:

> I'm not a fan of Harry Potter and never was. And I'm not looking forward to
> watching this movie.

Meanwhile, _[Daana](http://daana-lost-in-
translation.blogspot.com/2007/07/singled-out.html)_ feels like she's being
singled out and treated unfairly simply because she is a single girl:

> I just realized that there is a new kind of discrimination that has been
> practiced against me. In fact it is done in such an obscure manner that I
> did not recognize it until recently. I am talking about discrimination
> against SINGLE PEOPLE.  
>  Recently I discovered that if you are single, people around you will try
> and take advantage of that fact for the best of their ability to get
> whatever they want out of you.

_Kizzie_ , who [was previously very frustrated with her
Visa](http://wholeheartedly-sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/06/travelling-in-
post-911-world.html) application to travel to America, is now
[enjoying](http://wholeheartedly-sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/06/pictures.html)
her [trip](http://wholeheartedly-
sudaniya.blogspot.com/2007/06/california-9-hours-to-go.html) there.

[_Zoulcolm X_](http://zoulcolmx.blogspot.com/2007/07/latino-love.html) is also
happy but for a totally different reason:

> Finally, someone from South America viewed my blog (cheak my map below).
> lol, I know it's nothing, but to me it means a lot… and of course, I can't
> forget that it's the continent that gave birth to [Ernesto
> Guevara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Guevara). and [Gabriel Garcia
> Marquez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez) and [Isbel
> Allende](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Allende)

_Rara Avis_ , a Sudanese blogger living in New York, [informs us about the
coming Sudanese concert](http://raraavisrealm.blogspot.com/2007/07/sudanese-
concert-in-central-park-new.html) to be held in the city in Central Park on
July the 21st. It will have a number of very [prominent Sudanese
singers](http://www.summerstage.org/index1.aspx?BD=19721):

> If you're in New York, or the surrounding areas and are Sudanese, interested
> in the Sudan, or simply wanting to hear a different sort of music, here is
> an event, actually a concert by prominent Sudanese singers

She also wrote [a post about Sudanese
laws](http://raraavisrealm.blogspot.com/2007/07/sudanese-laws-and-rape-
victims.html) and rape victims:

> a recent report by Refugees International, a well known NGO based in
> Washington DC, has exposed the loopholes existent within the Sudanese laws
> that expose rape victims to more abuse and trauma.
>
> The report is titled Laws Without Justice: An Assessment of Sudanese Laws
> Affecting Survivors of Rape; which can be downloaded and read in full at
> [their
> website](http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/publication/detail/10070).
>
> … An introductory to the report could also be read in [this
> article](http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/10071/)
> at Refugees International newsletter.

[_Aperadosini_ is back](http://aperadosoni.blogspot.com/2007/07/blog-
post.html) from her blogging break with a new philosophical entry in which she
contemplates the meaning of life:

> Maybe that's the only truth in life; everything leads to nothing. Unless of
> course, you believe you're gonna die and go to some eternal heaven or
> eternal hell.. but even then.. then what?? you just live forever and ever,
> and whether it's an eternity of punishment or relaxation, you'll end up
> living the ultimate form of vacuousness (is that a word?). I love life,
> despite not understanding the point of it, and part of that love is probably
> due to the knowledge that I have a limited amount of time to live it… but
> living it forever is too long, why are people so attracted to forever
> anyway??

_Black Kush_ is also back from his blogging break with [a great
post](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/07/stoves-that-save-lives.html)
about life saving stoves for Darfur:

> How can stoves that use fire wood safe lives in Darfur? Strange, but it is
> something that is happening. A group of
> [scientists](http://www.darfurstoves.org/) have built a special stove that
> uses less firewood for effective cooking. Result: it reduces the number of
> trips to gather firewood, thus less chances of attacks and rapes.

Finally, he writes about the
[reshuffling](http://bloggingjuba.blogspot.com/2007/07/goss-reshuffle-timely-
or-too-late.html) of the Government of South Sudan (GoSS):

> The reshuffle is long overdue, as far as I can see. GOSS turn out to be
> corrupt and the only thing they were good at was squandering government
> money.
>
> … And the electricity in Juba? And the finance Minister scandal? How about
> the Ministry of Health? The woes are too many. I leave them for next time.
>
> The reshuffle? better late than never, at least.

That's all for this week!
