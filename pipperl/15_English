The Save Lo Sheng Sanatorium campaign has developed into 200 bloggers joint
action. In less than 18 hours, the bloggers got 150,000(TWD) for posting an ad
in apple daily news to express their anger towards the state violence and the
mainstream media's lack of coverage on the issue.

The action is initiated by [HeMiDEMi](http://www.hemidemi.com/), and supported
by many bloggers who wanted to save the neglected news back to the frontpage
in the newspapers. [Coolloud has a detailed report
