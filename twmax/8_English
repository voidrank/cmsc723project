Ecuadorean](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/03/08/ecuador-delfins-
humble-beginnings/) “techno-folklorist” [become an international
celebrity](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/03/07/ecuador-chile-kitsch-
goes-for-cash-on-youtube/) by using YouTube and a weblog. Now a small German
band is reaching out to bloggers around the world in their efforts to gain
fame and make friends.]

[Röntgenschall](http://www.rontgenschall.com/index.html) is on a virtual tour
in Lima, Perú. With it´s motto, “your blog is my stage”, this small band from
a small German city seeks to accomplish their great dream: Play gigs
throughout the world. With this in mind and defying the paradigm that some
people have that – the internet and the online diffusion of music goes against
their interests – they designed a system that ranked their fans. The five
blogs with most votes would host a virtual concert especially dedicated and
edited for them, their country, and community of users. So that´s how the
peruvian blog [Txitua.org](http://www.txitua.org/) was chosen as their next
“concert stop.”

This band has used different social networking mechanisms to spread their
music: Del.icio.us, biTTorrent, Jamendo, Myspace, Youtube, Hi5. They have even
freed up their music under a Creative Commons atribution, noncommercial,
share-alike license. These are Web 2.0 tools every Peruvian artist should
know.

I like Röntgenschall, what can I do to help them?

\- Download, copy, spread and remix their music.  
– Blog, make a Podcast or VideoCast  
– Join their [fan club](http://fanclub.rontgenschall.com/), maybe your blog
will be their next stop  
– Visit [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/4119/), write, rank it, make
it your favorite  
– [Add them](http://www.myspace.com/rontgenschall) to your MySpace  
– [Add](http://rontgenschall.hi5.com/) them to your hi5
