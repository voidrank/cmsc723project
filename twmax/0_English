Feb. 23, 2005 – from [this

Shortly after the Duma elections last December, I saw [this
article](http://fildz.livejournal.com/69733.html) and wanted to translate it.
I didn't have time then, and in truth it's a fairly challenging text to
translate, since it is all about mood and atmosphere. The furor around Putin's
[Luzhniki](http://edinros.ru/news.html?id=125609)
[speech](http://seansrussiablog.org/2007/11/23/putin-now-putin-forever/) has
faded, but Nizhny Novgorod, where part of the article is set, is still in the
news as [the location of
Medvedev's](http://gazeta.ru/politics/elections2008/2008/02/27_a_2650708.shtml)
[one official day](http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=166037&cid=5) [speaking as
a candidate](http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=166073&cid=5) and (perhaps less
significantly) as the region singled out [by the New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/europe/24putin.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print)
in a
[controversial](http://community.livejournal.com/nytimesinmoscow/3593.html)
[article](http://community.livejournal.com/nytimesinmoscow/2245.html) about
the Kremlin's (ab)use of “administrative resources,” so this seems like a
suitable item to post as we await the inevitable result on [March
2](http://news.google.ru/news?q=russian+election&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wn).

By way of background, this piece was supposed to appear in the Moscow weekly
[Bolshoi Gorod](http://www.bg.ru/), but the head of the publishing house that
prints BG decided not to print it as written, and BG's editor chose to publish
it on his ZheZhe rather than edit it. The comments on the blog where it was
posted suggest a range of assessments of that decision – mostly praise for the
article, but also some averring that it was proper not to publish it, because
[it's not
“journalism”](http://fildz.livejournal.com/69733.html?thread=619109#t619109)
and is [more suitable for a
ZheZhe](http://fildz.livejournal.com/69733.html?thread=620901#t620901)
[post](http://fildz.livejournal.com/69733.html?thread=630117#t630117), or that
[it's an “empty” tale describing a political reality that has existed for
years but is just now being noticed by the creative
intelligentsia](http://fildz.livejournal.com/69733.html?thread=627301#t627301)
(it is indeed something one could see hints of [a few years
ago](http://scrapsofmoscow.blogspot.com/2004/12/re-sovietization.html)).

[Comments](http://favorov.livejournal.com/301539.html) elsewhere (and [there
were
many](http://blogs.yandex.ru/search.xml?link=http://fildz.livejournal.com/69733.html),
at the time) speculated about [censorship or self-
censorship](http://anykeen.livejournal.com/82117.html) and led in some cases
to [soul-searching online
discussions](http://favorov.livejournal.com/301539.html?thread=1342179#t1342179)
among old friends [divided by their opinions of Russia's
path](http://favorov.livejournal.com/301539.html?thread=1346275#t1346275)… but
I should let the piece speak for itself.

> Then the driver drew his hand out of his tattered cuff and sharply turned

That was the winter; let's hope the spring will be different. Some observers
[seem
hopeful](http://gazeta.ru/politics/elections2008/2008/02/26_i_2649367.shtml).

By the way, the imprecation that is repeated in the middle and at the end of
the article is “суки” in the original (literally, “bitches”), so I took a bit
of license with it – though not much license, actually. According to my trusty
Русско-английский словарь ненормативной лексики (М: Астрель, 2002):

> Сука ж. […] 3. груб.-прост. Употр. как бранное слово Cf. bastard, shit,
> asshole (used as a term of abuse).
