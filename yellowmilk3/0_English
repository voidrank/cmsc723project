A rap music video criticizing the military-led government of Thailand has gone
[viral](http://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2018/10/24/with-my-countrys-
got-thai-rap-voices-rare-dissent-against-junta/) despite threats by
authorities to investigate the artists behind the popular song which was
denounced by the prime minister as “inappropriate”.

Released on October 22, the five-minute music video [“Prathet Ku
Mi”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZvzvLiGUtw) (What's My Country Got) by
the group “Rap Against Dictatorship” garnered 600,000 YouTube views in just
two days. As of this writing, it has over 40 million views.

The group of 10 rappers, with some of whom preferring to remain anonymous,
collectively wrote the song which criticizes state violence, government
corruption, and ongoing military rule.

Led by General Prayuth Chan-ocha, the army staged a
[coup](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2017-special-
coverage/thailands-three-turbulent-years-under-junta-rule/) in Thailand in
2014. A new constitution was drafted ensuring that the military continues to
dominate the state's bureaucracy even if civilian rule is restored. Prayuth
announced that elections will be held next year, but the government has
imposed several restrictions on political campaigning.

The rap group was praised for their bravery and creativity in depicting the
country’s situation. Below are screenshots of some parts of the music video:

This refers to the 2016 constitution which supposedly would facilitate the
country's transition to democracy but it only reinforced the dominance of the
military. Screenshot of YouTube video.

The background features a group of people who appear to be cheering for
something. Near the end of the video, it's revealed that it actually refers to
the mob and paramilitary forces that
[attacked](https://globalvoices.org/2016/10/10/activists-students-and-
survivors-commemorate-thailands-forgotten-massacre/) and killed dozens of
Thammasat University students who were protesting against military rule in
1976.

Asked about the decision to include the brutal [tree-
hanging](https://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/art/1098817/in-the-eye-of-the-
storm) massacre at Thammasat University in the video, and whether this
glorifies violence, director Teerawat Rujintham
[explained](https://prachatai.com/english/node/7834) in an interview with
Prachatai website that:

> Sometimes we also have to present violence using a straightforward method,
> so that people will feel and see certain truths.
>
> Society that lives under fear and self-censorship doesn’t work. If we
> believe in something, we must be brave enough to fight and take a stand for
> it.

Thai authorities led by Prayut
[criticized](https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1567342/cops-pm-renew-
tizzy-over-rap-song) the song for “disrespecting” the country and police
chiefs threatened to investigate the rap group and charge whoever promotes the
song in social media. So far, no arrests have been ordered.

Instead, the government [launched](https://theaseanpost.com/article/thai-
juntas-response-viral-rap-flops) its own rap song
[celebrating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=TUopomNl6rY)
innovation and progress, but it failed to generate buzz on social media.

It is possible that the Prayut government, sensing the popularity of the song
among young people, is being careful not to further inflame public sentiment
at a time when it is trying to get the support of voters.

Indeed, many Thai netizens and leaders of various political groups have
expressed support to the rappers:

> I always say soft power like music and literature is a critical force to
> push the society towards progressive future. Rap Against Dictatorship has
> done a great job with

In an interview with Coconuts news website, “Rap Against Dictatorship”
[responded](https://coconuts.co/bangkok/features/rapping-name-rap-
dictatorship-co-founder-talks-influences-freedom-speech-getting-pms-
attention/) to critics who accused them of tainting the global image of
Thailand:

> To the people who say we’re ‘ruining Thailand’s reputation’, I ask what
