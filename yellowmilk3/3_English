A meta-meme circulating on Russian social media. COP looking at MEME: “Is this
a criminal case?”

Imagine you’re online and you see an amusing Game of Thrones meme likening the
resurrection of one of the main characters, John Snow, to the resurrection of
Christ. Chuckling to yourself, you re-post it on your social media page and
promptly forget about it.

A few days later, the police raid your apartment and charge you with
extremism. In addition to facing years in prison, you’re frozen out of your
bank accounts.

Welcome to the reality that unsuspecting social media users across Russia are
now facing as authorities ramp up their campaign against online extremism.

Though prosecutions for online posts are[ nothing
new](https://globalvoices.org/2018/05/25/russian-anti-corruption-activists-
are-jailed-for-inciting-riots-based-on-their-tweets-and-retweets/) in Russia,
this latest round has attracted special attention because many of them are
based exclusively on memes. Daniil Markin, a 19-year-old resident of the town
of Barnaul, [was recently charged](https://meduza.io/feature/2018/07/30/dvuh-
zhiteley-barnaula-obvinyayut-v-ekstremizme-iz-za-memov-vo-vkontakte-
zayavleniya-na-nih-podali-odni-i-te-zhe-studentki-yurfaka) under Article 148
of the Russian Criminal Code, for “insulting the feelings of religious
believers” for posting several memes on religious themes, including the
aforementioned Jon Snow meme.

As a result of the charges, he has been added to a national register of
extremists and had his bank accounts frozen. In an interview with Meduza,
Markin said:

> Я считаю, что для определенного процента людей это могло показаться
> оскорбительным, но не настолько, чтобы заводить уголовное дело.

> I can see how for some people this could be offensive, but not so much that
> they could press charges.

Markin’s situation isn’t unique, not even in his city of Barnaul. In a [June
23 Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/La72La/status/1021361090897301509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw),
fellow Barnaul resident Maria Motuznaya described how a group of policemen
came to her apartment with a search warrant, interrogated her about memes she
had posted (some of which were racist, others offensive to religious
sentiment) and confiscated her phone.

While Motuznaya initially laughed it off, the police taunted her, telling her
that another woman had also thought it was a game until she was put behind
bars for three years. Motuznaya was later charged with extremism under Article
282 of the Russian Criminal Code.

While the memes Markin and Motuznaya posted could easily offend religious
sentiments, they did not represent a direct threat, incitement to violence, or
promotion of an extremist or violent ideology. And the Russian internet is
full of memes like this. So what tipped off authorities? And how did they so
swiftly identify Markin and Motuznaya?

Both cases began with tips from a pair of students at a local higher-ed
institute. Neither defendant knew these individuals personally. Because of
this, Markin feels there’s something more to his prosecution.

> Оперативники обнаруживают меня каким-либо образом, предлагают студенткам
> написать заявления за определенные „плюшки“ на учебе или даже финансовую
> помощь.

> The officers find out about me somehow and suggest that these students file
> a complaint for extra study “perks” or even financial support.

The situation may be less of a coincidence than it seems. Pressure on police
in Russia to weed out extremism has created many situations in which
authorities choose a target and then seek out justification for prosecution.

Motuznaya [also
suggested](https://twitter.com/La72La/status/1021365356601004037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
an ulterior motive during her interrogation. She had previously made several
posts about Alexey Navalny, a Russian opposition figure known for his anti-
corruption campaigns. It is unclear whether this had any bearing on her
arrest.

The theory of memes-as-pretext, however, seems more and more plausible. Just
recently, a journalist from the city of Tuva [was
arrested](https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2018/08/07/143958-v-tuve-
zaderzhali-zhurnalistku-za-publikatsiyu-istoricheskih-fotografiy-so-svastikoy-
vo-vkontakte) for posting two articles in 2014 that were accompanied by photos
of Adolf Hitler and Nazi youth groups. This journalist had an activist past,
as she wrote on issues affecting quality of life in the city and was campaign
manager for Ksenia Sobchak, a liberal candidate in the 2018 Russian
presidential elections.

###

### How are social media companies responding?

Social media companies also play a pivotal role in identifying these memes and
the people who post them. Vkontakte, one of the two most popular social
networks in Russia, has been under fire for “ratting out” their users to the
authorities and readily giving away their personal details for prosecution.
Under Russian law, administrators of social networks are obligated to gather
and store users’ personal information for six months, and provide access to
these materials when requested by the authorities. For years, Vkontakte has
been only too eager to [comply with such
requests](https://meduza.io/feature/2016/07/05/vkontakte-so-sledovatelyami).

An avalanche of recent negative coverage of criminal cases against social
media users prompted the tech giant Mail.Ru, which owns Vkontakte, to release
a statement condemning the practice of jailing people for memes. Observers
were quick to point out Mail.ru's hypocrisy.

As Mediazona, an independent online outlet focused on police brutality and
political show trials in Russia, put it:

> ВК (главный помощник в уголовных делах за репосты) выступил против дел за
> репосты<https://t.co/GEqpHzNNWN>
> [pic.twitter.com/qMhVWPM4td](https://t.co/qMhVWPM4td)

> Vkontakte (which provides most of the assistance in criminal cases for
> sharing [of memes]) condemns criminal cases for sharing.

###

### Authorities see arrests as a sign of progress — the more, the better

Why has Barnaul become such a flashpoint for these types of cases? The
regional office of the Investigative Committee, Russia’s main federal
investigative agency, has since 2016 been leading[ a
campaign](https://zona.media/article/2018/08/03/barnaul) to tackle online
extremism among young people. Nationwide, [human rights experts
estimate](http://codaru.com/war-on-reason/nakazanie-nishhetoj/) that roughly
5000 people have been arrested for sharing some type of “extremist” content
online.

In July 2018, a public-service announcement video was released explaining
efforts at clamping down on extremist behavior online. The announcement
defined this behavior as, among other things, anything promoting separatism,
religious discord, or hatred towards others on ethnic or religious grounds.

The video ends with the following appeal:

> Ведь человечество — это содружество разных культур, каждая из которых
> интересна и духовно богата. Нет плохих или хороших, мы — единое целое.

> After all, humanity is a community of different cultures, each of which is
> fascinating and spiritually rich. There aren’t bad or good ones, we are all
> one united whole.

At face value, this might be a laudable sentiment. But why the sudden interest
in meme-based posts? Ilya Shepelin, a correspondent for the independent
Russian news outlet Dozhd, explained [it this
way](https://www.facebook.com/ishepelin/posts/1909498672445071):

> Бюрократия.  
>  
>  Два года назад в Алтайском крае зарегистрировали экстремистских
> преступлений на 10% меньше, чем следовало. 26 вместо 29. В результате «край
> оказался в немногочисленной группе регионов, показавших отрицательную
> статистику по выявлению преступлений».  
>  
>  Просрали цифры, получили нагоняй от федерального министерства — и ух, как
> взялись за работенку. Ни одной картинки с патриархом и Игрой престолов не
> пропускают, на всё заводят дела.  
>  
>  И в 2017 году край показал резкий рост «выявленных экстремистских
> преступлений» почти вдвое больше — на 73%. Теперь седьмое место среди
> регионов России. Есть чем гордиться.

### Stuck on Russia's federal register of terrorists and extremists

The ramifications of these “extremism” charges, which fall under criminal code
articles 282 and 148, continue long after one’s sentence has ended. When
charged under these articles, an individual is permanently placed on the
[federal register of terrorists and extremists](http://codaru.com/war-on-
reason/nakazanie-nishhetoj/). Once on the list, one cannot withdraw more than
10,000 rubles (around 150 US dollars) at a time and cannot use their credit or
debit cards.

These two consequences combine to create an unsavory third problem: being
officially labeled a terrorist makes potential employers extremely hesitant to
hire you. And if they do, they are obligated to jump through extra regulatory
hoops just to pay taxes related to your employment.

Because of this, those on the list often find themselves punished with poverty
and diminishing prospects both in terms of career and even housing. Who would
rent to, much less give a mortgage to, an official terrorist or extremist?

As one human rights lawyer[ put it](http://codaru.com/war-on-reason/nakazanie-
nishhetoj/),

> About a quarter of the cases of persecution “for words” under extremist and
> terrorist articles are criticism of the authorities, separatist propaganda,
> criticism of the annexation of Crimea and so on. 75% of the rest of the
> cases are likes and reposts on social media.

### A meme of one's own

With the increase in prosecutions over meme-sharing the issue itself has of
course become a meme of its own.

Below, one user employed the [“Is this a pigeon?”
meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/is-this-a-pigeon) to demonstrate how
memes have become the basis for criminal cases:

> Теперь как-то так [pic.twitter.com/al0ZEUPegA](https://t.co/al0ZEUPegA)

> Now it’s something like this.  
>  _Meme captions: “Me” on the man, “meme” on the butterfly._  
>  _Bottom text:_ Is this a criminal charge?

Another used characters from the sci-fi movie Interstellar, toying with the
film’s idea about space travel and time-dilation to reference the surreal
situation in Barnaul:

> Via Лепра [pic.twitter.com/bC8ZtS5Vrz](https://t.co/bC8ZtS5Vrz)

> _Background sign:_ Barnaul.  
>  _Bottom text:_ One meme here is equal to seven years.

Others went for an even more meta approach. Well-known Russian blogger and
Twitter user [Anatolii Kapustin](https://twitter.com/A_Kapustin) wanted to
draw attention to the fact that memes can lead to jail time now, and created
the Twitter account “[Text memes you can be jailed
for”](https://twitter.com/text_ments), which draws on actual memes that have
triggered extremism charges and are now being assessed in court.

Kapustin describes image memes in text format, using direct quotes from court
documents, as a way to [post memes while avoiding criminal
charges](https://daily.afisha.ru/infoporn/9632-kak-publikovat-memy-chtoby-

The range of themes reflected in these memes, from despicably racist to
lightheartedly irreverent, demonstrates that the authorities’ anti-meme-
extremism campaign is too broadly defined to be effective at actually removing
threats and incitement to violence from online platforms.

Even if the anti-extremism campaign’s goals are taken at face value, the
fundamental question (here and in many other countries) remains: What role
should law enforcement play in ensuring hateful and objectionable content is
deleted from social networks?

In the Russian case, with authorities’ reliance on disproportionately harsh
jail sentences and seemingly indefinite financial repercussions, it is clear
that Vkontakte’s abdication of its role in self-moderation is hurting its
users. Rather than handing over users’ data so that authorities can prosecute
them for racist and “edgy” memes, the company should be more proactive in
monitoring posts and taking down content that can easily be described as
offensive, in a consistent, transparent and accountable way.

It wouldn’t be easy, but as the global debate over moderating social networks
continues, the alternatives currently available, arrests or rampant toxicity,
show that they’ve got to try.
