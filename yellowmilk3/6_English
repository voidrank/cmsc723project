As Brazil's presidential elections draw near, two important issues are top and
centre: first, the hope of placating the chaos of that has engulfed the
country's politics for the past four years. Second, the country's favorite
sport, second only to football: memes.

The first presidential debate broadcasted on live television, on August 9,
provided a true field day for its enthusiasts when Cabo Daciolo, an
evangelical firefighter running for the small far-right party Patriota
(Patriot), [asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ANqSdWvTlo) another
candidate to share his thoughts on “the Ursal project”.

Daciolo (left): “Ursal is the New World Order that seeks to unify all America
into a single communist homeland! And Ciro is part of it! We will stop it with
the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ! Amen!”. Ciro Gomes (right): “Democracy is
great, a beautiful thing … but it has certain costs” Cartoon by Carlos Ruas ,
used with permission.

As Daciolo explained, Ursal is the Portuguese acronym for Union of Socialist
Republics of Latin America, a purpoted plan of communist triumph in the
fashion of the defunct Soviet Union.

Upon his interlocutor's denial of any knowledge about the project, Daciolo
continued:

> Sabe sim, estamos falando aqui de um plano que se chama nova ordem mundial,
> união de toda a América do Sul, conexão de toda América do Sul, tirando
> todas as fronteiras e fazendo apenas uma nação, pátria grande. Poucos
> ouviram falar disso e vai ser pouco divulgado isso. Eles sabem do que
> estamos falando. Quero deixar bem claro que, no nosso governo, o comunismo
> não vai ter vez.

> Yes, you know, we are talking about a plan that is called New World Order,
> the union of all of South America, connection of all of South America,
> taking away all the borders, making one single nation, the great motherland.
> Few people have heard about this, this isn't going to be very much
> publicized. They know what we are talking about. I want to make it very
> clear that, in our government, communism will not have any space.

It turns out that the “project Ursal” is a rather obscure, crazy conspiracy
theory that has run wild on Brazil's far-right forums and blogs for a good
number of years. A [website](http://www.dossieursal.com) created in 2015
called Ursal Dossier compiles all the “evidence” proving the existence of such
a plan.

However, now that it was out in the open, progressive sectors of the Brazil
internet really liked the idea. In a matter of days, Ursal had a map, logo,
slogans, passport, football team, and a national anthem.

In Portuguese, the word “urso” means bear, prompting memes with… bears.

By integrating some of the best national football teams in the world, Ursal
would have the greatest number of FIFA World Cup championships:

It is possible to buy a Ursal t-shirt:

And Ursal's national anthem was fully crowdsourced on Twitter:

### Lifecycle of a conspiracy

The term Ursal was created, as a joke, by conservative Brazilian professor
Maria Lúcia Victor Barbosa, in 2001. In an article published by right-wing
blogs at that time, she used the term to poke fun at that year's edition of
the São Paulo Forum summit, a gathering of Latin American and Caribbean left-
wing political parties and organizations.

At the 2001 summit, Worker's Party founder and former Brazil's president Luiz
Inácio Lula da Silva made a vehement speech against the Free Trade Area of the
Americas, a proposal made by the Bill Clinton administration in the United
States to reduce trade barriers between all American countries.

In her article, professor Barbosa said:

> Do alto do seu triunfo ele soltou o verbo para gáudio de esquerdas e, para
> ser imparcial, direitas latino-americanas: “É um projeto de anexação que os
> Estados Unidos querem impor. Será o fim da integração latino-americana”. Mas
> qual seria, me pergunto, essa tal integração no modelo Castro-Chávez-Lula?
> Quem sabe, a criação da União das Republiquetas Socialistas da América
> Latina (URSAL)?

> From its moral high ground, [Lula] declared, to the joy of the leftists and
> rightists of Latin America: ‘It's a project of annexation by the United
> States. It will be the end of the Latin American integration”. But what
> would be, I ask, this integration in the model Castro-Chávez-Lula? Perhaps,
> the creation of the Union of the Socialist Republics of Latin America?

Within a couple of years, Ursal was spoken of in right-wing blogs and forums
as a fact, the supposed ultimate goal of the São Paulo Forum.

In an [interview](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/08/critica-do-pt-
sociologa-diz-que-inventou-ursal-em-2001-como-
ironia.shtml?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=twfolha) with
Brazil newspaper Folha de S.Paulo on August 13, 2018, professor Barbosa
confirmed that she had come up with the term as an irony.
