[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8XlFBSR1iE&feature=youtu.be) ‘Kyz’.

Teenage artist Zere Asylbek has burst into public life in Kyrgyzstan with a
song defending women's rights to do as they please with their bodies.

In doing so, she has also made her mark on a highly-charged debate with both
national and global dimensions.

The song _Kyz_ , which translates as ‘girl’ in Kyrgyz is Zere's first recorded
song. Interviewed by the Kyrgyz service of RFE/RL on September 16, Zere
[said](https://rus.azattyk.org/a/29494745.html) she did not consider herself a
musician per se, but rather a “creative person in the freest sense.”

The point of _Kyz_ , she said, was to highlight that while every person has
their own mission, “the missions of others should be accepted, or at least
acknowledged.”

## What is this song all about?

In Kyrgyzstan, women's clothing has been a hot-button topic for some time,
pitting conservatives against secularists wary of Islam's growing as social
battles simmer over the ex-Soviet country's future.

Former President Almazbek Atambayev poured lighter fuel on the bonfire in 2016
when he endorsed a series of banners that asked “where (the Kyrgyz people)
were headed?”

The banners printed by a patriotic group compared a relatively recent penchant
for the niqab in some parts of the country unfavourably with traditional
Kyrgyz dress.

Those banners were later met with an ironic response in the form of banners
carrying the same alarmist question but instead showing Kyrgyz women wearing
short skirts and shorts in place of the women wearing niqabs.

Atambayev called the authors of the second banner “smarty-pants.”

“Our women have been wearing miniskirts since 1950s, and they never thought
about wearing an explosive belt,” [said](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-
trending-36846249) Atambayev.

His throwaway comments on Islamic dress have been

secretary Boris Johnson earlier this year.

was put up in Bishkek by a group of patriots and later across the country
after it won approval from ex-leader Almazbek Atambayev. Some of the banners

## United we stand

Poignantly, the video for Zere's debut song features women whose dress speaks
to Kyrgyzstan's diversity. Unsurprisingly, that message has failed to please
everyone.

Currently the video has gathered around 120,000 views in four days, a
phenomenal number considering Kyrgyzstan is a country of just 6 million and
the song is in the Kyrgyz language, rather than in the republic's second
language, Russian.

As of this writing the clip has been liked 2,000 times and disliked 5,500
times. Many of the comments on Facebook posts featuring the video express
disgust and even hatred towards the 19-year-old singer.

[Writing on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/asylbek.zhoodonbekov/posts/2645027415523088)
shortly after the clip's release, Zere Asylbek's father Asylbek Zhodonbekov
said that he had received a mixture of congratulations and complaints from
friends and acquaintances.

Zhodonbekov noted that Zere had become inclined towards political activism
after a [bride kidnapping victim was murdered by her captor inside a police
station](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1760086/3-burulai-one-many-victims-
tradition-bride-kidnapping-kyrgyzstan/) as she was waiting to write a witness
statement against him in May.

The shocking crime sparked protests against law enforcement's negligence in a
country where thousands of girls are kidnapped every year and “had a strong
impact on her”, he said.

Some of the messages Zhodonbekov received were particularly harsh. One
acquaintance even compared Zere to Baba Yaga, a scary witch-like character
from Russian folklore. “Is this really your daughter?” the person asked.

“Yes, Zere is my daughter,” Zhodonbekov wrote in his post. “A free-thinking
daughter of a free Kyrgyzstan.”
