Detail from an infographic describing the Mexican team's possible consequences
for violating FIFA's rules regarding the homophobic language used by their
fans during the World Cup. Used with permission by Pictoline.

As Russia hosts the final days of the FIFA [World Cup
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup)2018, Mexico's team has
drawn the attention of the Federation of International Football Association
(FIFA) organizers and the press, but it's not for their stellar skills, but
rather their fans’ foul calls. Did Mexican fans violate FIFA rules, or were
they just celebrating their favorite team?

After the [Mexico national
team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team) (known as
“El Tri” because of their tricolor uniform that mirrors the colors of the
national flag) played their first game against Germany, FIFA announced the
opening of a disciplinary case against chants used by their fans during the
game.

_El Tri_ fans customarily scream the word ‘puto’ (Mexican Spanish for
‘faggot’) in unison every time the rival goalkeeper restarts a play by putting
the ball in motion (especially through a [goal
kick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_kick)).

_Deutsche Welle,_ the German media outlet with a global presence,
[reported](http://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-2018-fifa-to-investigate-homophobic-
chants-in-germany-mexico-game/a-44281558) the offenses by Mexican fans in this
way:

> Miles de hinchas mexicanos insultaron a
> [Neuer](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer) [portero del equipo
> Alemán] el domingo durante la victoria de México por 1-0 sobre Alemania.

> Thousands of Mexican fans insulted
> [Neuer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer) [goal keeper of the
> German team] last Sunday during Mexico's 1-0 victory over Germany.

### Offensive or just an expression?

The term ‘puto’ is essentially pejorative, vulgar and degrading. In daily
language (in every social class in Mexico) it is also used as an insult to
describe a gay male or a female perceived as promiscuous or engaged in sex
work. This is consistent with definitions provided by
[Fundéu](https://www.fundeu.es/noticia/el-idioma-del-sexo-6978/), the
regulatory authority on Spanish language in mainstream media, and the [Royal
Spanish Academy of Language](http://dle.rae.es/?id=UjqH8h6). The Mexican
Federation of Football, however, maintains the [opposite
position](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/deportes/2016/10/04/fmf-afirma-que-puto-
no-es-un-grito-homofobico), denying that the expression is insulting.

It is not the first time that the Mexico national team finds itself embroiled
in this controversy. Four years ago in Brazil, Mexican fans also[ shouted this
chant](https://juantadeo.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/puto-el-que-lo-lea-fifa/) on
several occasions. The same [happened in
2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/06/21/mexican-
soccer-federation-begs-fans-to-stop-homophobic-chant-at-
games/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2fa5a22bb487), also in Russia, during the
[Confederations Cup
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Confederations_Cup)organized by FIFA.

The website _Reporte Índigo_ has gathered opinions from different Mexican
personalities (all male) about the controversial chant. Global Voices selected
two as an example:

**Daniel Giménez Cacho**
([actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gim%C3%A9nez_Cacho)):

> No, ‘puto’ no es discriminatorio, ‘puto’ es una palabra de un prefijo
> náhuatl, que es putotzin y que significa ‘el que lo lea’… es un chiste
> (risas). Por supuesto que es discriminatorio, yo tenía problemas con eso
> desde la canción tan popular del grupo Molotov (la canción ‘Puto’), a mí esa
> canción no me gustaba, no me gusta; creo que hay que cuidar el lenguaje, los
> discursos de odio. La violencia contra la mujer, por ejemplo, eso no lo va
> acabar ningún tipo de ley si no modificamos la cultura nuestra, y la cultura
> empieza por cómo nos relacionamos, cómo hablamos, qué palabras usamos, y hay
> que ser conscientes de ellas. Yo creo.

> No, ‘puto’ is not discriminatory, ‘puto’ is a word from the Nahuatl
> language, which is ‘putozin’ and it means ‘the one who reads it'…it is a
> joke (laughs) [Referring to a common joke seen online saying ‘the one who

> with that word since the very popular song by the group Molotov ([the song
> ‘Puto’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzEbm7yup7g)). I didn't like that
> song, I don't like it, I think we have to take care of the language we use,

> them. I believe.

**Paco Ignacio Taibo II**
([writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_Ignacio_Taibo_II)):

> Gritarle ‘puto’ al portero del enemigo yo creo que no tiene connotaciones
> homofóbicas, es simplemente una injuria, un insulto para desestabilizar al
> enemigo. Yo espero que se practique los 16 de septiembre [día en que los

> que está siendo demasiada bronca de muy poca cosa, lo políticamente correcto
> rara vez corresponde con lo políticamente justo y real.

> I don't think screaming ‘puto’ to the enemy's goal keeper has homophobic
> connotations, it is simply a slur, an insult to destabilize the enemy. I
> hope that it is also chanted on September 16 [the day that Mexicans
> celebrate independence] in front of the governmental palace, no? It seems to

> rarely corresponds to the politically fair and real.

According to [Andoni Bello](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/gay/2014/06/20/puto-
si-nos-ofende-tri-gay), head of the Gay Football Selection (Or [Tri Gay, an
organization](http://trigaymexico.blogspot.com/) defending LGBTIQ rights), the
screaming ‘puto’ _is_ offensive, and suggested that fans should find other
ways of giving a hard time to rival teams.

According to FIFA rules, as shown in the
[infographic](http://pictoline.com/10255-ademas-de-ser-un-grito-homofobico-el-
eeeeeh-pu-podria-traerle-problemas-serios-a-la-seleccion-mexicana-esto-es-lo-
que-dice-el-reglamento-de-la-fifa-al-respecto-%F0%9F%91%87/) created by
Pictoline (a visual graphics company), sanctions relating to the use of
homophobic or racist expressions can affect El Tri's outcome in the World Cup,
either by accrediting defeat, subtracting points obtained, or in the worst
case, expelling them from the competition:

> In addition to being considered a homophobic scream, the “EEEEEH P…” could
> cause serious problems for the Mexican National Team. This is what the FIFA
> rules state:  
>  1\. The association or the club will be sanctioned with fine of no less
> than 26,000 euros [$30,275 United States Dollars] FINED: (this has already
> happened).  
>  2\. In the case of serious violations, supplemental sanctions could be
> levied such as:  
>  a. Bar fans from entering the stadiums.  
>  b. A defeat of three goals to zero.  
>  c. The subtraction of points.  
>  d. Or even exclusion from the competition (and we were doing so well!).

Through Twitter, fans have been asked not to repeat this insult in subsequent
El Tri games:

### Returning to the field

Of the eight groups marked by letters between A through H, Mexico classified
in Group F, competing against South Korea, Sweden, and Germany. The team that
earns first place in Group F will face off in round eight of the finals
against the team that occupies second place in Group E comprised of Brazil,
Costa Rica, Serbia and Switzerland. At the same time, the team that occupies
second place in Group F will compete against the team that won first place in
Group E.

Before the start of the worldwide joust, El Tri had achieved 15th place out of
209 positions in the FIFA global ranking. Mexico has a good chance of winning
as long as their fans can “show that [they] can behave [themselves].”
