Japanese vending machines have long been famous for selling the most curious
things, like flowers, umbrellas, and ties. But even with [one vending machine
for every 23 people](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2010.html) and [annual
sales that exceed $60 billion,](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-
vending-machines-in-japan-2017-1) one can still be surprised at what comes out
of their take-out port.

In the city of Hiroshima, residents have been abuzz over the appearance of a
pizza vending machine located near [local
hangout](http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1808/06/news105.html) TSUTAYA,
part of a national chain of bookstores in Japan. The vending machine serves up
two kinds of pizza:
[margherita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Margherita) (basil,
mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce) for about US$ 10 and four-cheese for
about US$ 13 with a cooking time of just three minutes. TSUTAYA's parent
company, which is behind the vending machines, hopes to eventually have other
such machines at bookstores across Japan.

In the meantime, locals are pleasantly surprised by just how tasty machine-
baked pizza can be.

Meanwhile, in Inashiki, a city located in the Ibaraki prefecture, about an
hour by train northeast of Tokyo, one restaurant was found to have [fully-
functioning antique vending machines from the
1960s](http://papicocafe.blog.jp/8802657.html).

For 300 yen, travelers can purchase a simple meat-and-rice bento box with
chopsticks. There are three types to choose from: fried chicken, pork cutlet,
and grilled meat, with the last being the most popular choice.

Finally, hidden in the city of Kagoshima, on the southwestern tip of the
island of Kyushu, lies a fresh crepe vending machine. It's located in
Kagoshima's [Tenmonkan](https://youtu.be/89AfXJNRNaQ) shopping district,
hidden near a bus stop and reportedly difficult to find.

Those lucky enough to find this most unusual of vending machines are treated
to tasty crepes at the cost of 200 yen (about US$ 2).

> Kagoshima's hidden gem: a crepe vending machine!

The vending machine serves a variety of flavors of crepe, including chocolate
cream, caramel, strawberry cream, and cheese. The crepes are delivered in a
glass bottle, which customers are asked to return after they are done.

With this machine being a one-of-a-kind favorite, some users are wondering if
other cities also have one of their own:
