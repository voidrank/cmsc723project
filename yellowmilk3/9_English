Women are part of the reason Armenia now has the prime minister it does. Yet
for many, the “revolution” that brought reform-minded protest leader Nikol
Pashinyan to power this May has only just begun.

The thousands of women who took to Armenia’s streets for roughly 40 days this
spring were protesting not only for a change in government, but for [their
rights](https://chai-khana.org/en/armenia-daring-to-protest-while-female) in a
traditionally patriarchal society.

For three of these protesters — Maria Karapetyan, 30, head of development for
the Imagine Center for Conflict Transformation, Avnik Melikyan, 22, a project
coordinator at the non-profit Society without Violence and 23-year-old
political activist Lilith Baghdasaryan — that requires more than just a seat
in parliament or[ in the cabinet.](https://iwpr.net/global-voices/where-are-
women-armenias-revolution)

It requires changing attitudes and giving more Armenian women the skills they
need to hold power.

In that respect, these women protesters are, indeed, “revolutionaries.”
