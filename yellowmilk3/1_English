In a big victory for grassroots activism in Macedonia, a new water supply
system was built in the southern municipality of Gevgelija, after years of
struggle by local activists who kept warning their drinking water is poisoned
with arsenic.

On November 7, 2018, the authorities opened a new water supply facility that
gathers water from three new wells and contains a purification unit and
pipelines. The system will provide drinking water for the 19,500 inhabitants
in the surrounding areas, [local news site
Gevgelijanet.com](https://gevgelijanet.com/index.php/vesti/fokus/item/3518-pusteni-
vo-upotreba-novite-bunari-kaj-vardar) reported.

The facility, which cost 1.7 million euros (1.9 million US dollars), finally
solves the problem of toxic arsenic seeping into the drinking water. The
pollution began 15 years ago after an earthquake put arsenic-rich rocks in
contact with the water table.

This development vindicated “Arsena” — a group of local activists that had
been trying to warn the public about the water's toxicity for several years.
Pegged as troublemakers by the right-wing populist regime that ruled Macedonia
from 2006 to 2017, the activists suffered persecution as a result of their
efforts.

Even though the Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia
determined in 2012 that the water was dangerously toxic, the political
authorities refused to admit that there was any problem with the water supply.
The populist party VMRO-DPMNE, that was in power at the time, prioritized
maintaining a perception that the country is prospering under their rule to
actually solving issues that affect the quality of life, like
[air](https://globalvoices.org/2016/01/22/the-air-pollution-in-macedonia-is-
bringing-people-into-the-streets-and-theres-an-app-for-that/) and water
pollution. Therefore, both the municipality and the state government
maintained that everything was okay and that those who claimed otherwise were
just pawns of the opposition.

[Arsena](https://www.facebook.com/arsenagevgelija) conducted additional
analyses of the tap water in several different labs in 2014 and attempted to
publish the results. The government reacted by treating them as pariahs and
subjected them to various forms of harassment over the years — including smear
campaigns and [malicious inspections intended to block their
work](https://globalvoices.org/2017/02/25/macedonias-ruling-party-is-draining-
civil-society-groups-time-and-money/). Moreover, most local media (self)
censored any information provided by the activists. The censorship was so
strong that even [billboard companies refused to rent them
space](https://gevgelijanet.com/index.php/vesti/fokus/item/595-%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0-%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8)
to publish the results of the analyses.

In order to break the news for their local audience, the activists had to
resort to roundabout tactics, and first spread the information at the national
level. To do that, on February 17, 2014, they devised a press conference in
the capital, which was not announced as an initiative by civil society (which
the media mostly ignored) but rather as a commercial presentation of a new
brand of mineral water — Arsena.

When the reporters of national media came to the “business” event, the
activists presented them with plastic bottles of water from Gevgelija water
supply. They explained that the brand is called Arsena due to the high level
of arsenic in the water, and invited everyone to share the water that is
consumed on daily basis by citizens of Gevgelija. They also presented the
results of the scientific measurements, as well as health data indicating high
levels of cancer and mortality in the area, which is likely related to the
toxic water.

Only one national level TV reported about this event, but that was enough for
the citizens of Gevgelija to learn about it, and make a rush on the local
shops to buy bottled water.

During the next few years, the activists pushed the issue in any way they
could by [starting petitions](http://meta.mk/en/petition-issued-by-arsena-
association-we-demand-that-due-to-high-quantities-of-arsenic-in-the-drinking-
water-the-people-from-gevgelija-should-pay-for-it-as-a-technical-water/) and
actions for [donating clean bottled water for the underprivileged
socioeconomic groups](http://mojotgrad.com/arsena-so-donacija-od-250-litrri-
zdrava-voda-za-socijalno-zagrozenite-vo-gevgelija/). They also fought for
[other health causes](https://globalvoices.org/2017/04/25/one-small-towns-
referendum-on-gold-mining-is-a-big-victory-for-citizen-participation-in-
macedonia/).

Slowly, the activists managed to overcome denial by the authorities, who never
admitted the tap water is toxic, but nevertheless announced the opening of new
water treatment plants. Several months after the PR stunt in the capital city,
Gevgelija local government performed ribbon-cutting ceremonies for a new well.
However, the construction site remained empty for the next three years.

The actual construction of the new water supply system started in February
2017, thanks to [a new project](http://meta.mk/pochna-izgrabata-na-nov-
vodovoden-sistem-vo-gevgelija-vo-ramki-na-proektot-eu-za-tebe/) co-funded by
the Macedonian government, the European Union and the World Bank. The same
year, after local elections, the municipal government changed. Solving the
water supply problem was one of the main goals for the new administration, and
the facility was finished by November 2018.

The activists of the Arsena initiative celebrated in their characteristic
modest way, by publishing the [following
statement](https://www.facebook.com/arsenagevgelija/posts/1797422110387088)
alongside the good news on their Facebook page.
