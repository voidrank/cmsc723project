All around the world, people have lauded the food landscape in Hong Kong for
its diversity and international offerings. For the first time ever, Michelin
last year even [included the city's street
food](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/05/michelin-includes-
street-food-category-for-first-time-in-hong-kong-guide) in its guide of Hong
Kong's local cuisine. The arrival of food trucks should be adding new colour
to this smorgasbord, but locals find the imported culture a misfit.

The idea of bringing in food trucks first appeared as a tourism initiative in
the [Budget Speech
2015-2016](http://www.budget.gov.hk/2015/eng/budget19.html). After a year’s
deliberations, the Food Truck Pilot Scheme was finally launched on March 30,
2016.

The government made a public call for proposals and issued 16 licenses for the
pilot scheme. The competition was vigorous: a total of 192 applicants competed
for 16 licenses. The applicants had to submit a written proposal, prepare a
HK$600,000 (approximately US$77,400) start-up cost, so as to operate a kitchen
that meets extremely strict hygiene standards. Those who were short-listed
then entered a culinary contest and presented their set menus to food experts
and representatives of the travel industry, representatives of venues for
food-truck operations, and government officials.

As expected, more than half of the licenses [ended
up](http://www.tourism.gov.hk/resources/english/paperreport_doc/press/2016-07-27/Annex_1_selected_applicants_eng.pdf)
in the hands of big corporate food subsidiaries, which leveraged their
experience in the fast-food industry.

Many, however, believe the food-truck scheme is poorly and unfairly designed.
Kenneth Ip, a local architect, for example criticizes the licensing process
for killing the grassroots spirit. In [an
article](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/04/07/hong-kong-food-trucks-why-the-
governments-scheme-completely-misses-the-point/) published on Hong Kong Free
Press, he wrote:

Indeed, even though local micro-entrepreneurs received ten bonus points in the
licensing consideration process, the start-up cost and kitchen management
costs are enormously high because of the strict hygiene standards demanded by
the government.

Kenneth Ip also argues that the design of the food truck is at odds with the
local urban landscape:

While the winning cuisine is said to demonstrate Hong Kong's East-meets-West
food culture, local residents have complained that it dilutes the truly
authentic tastes of local cuisine. Commenting on a news article about the
food-truck contest, readers

some of their anger:

And what of locals’ nostalgia for that comforting mix of food stores and
street food carts? The biggest roadblock to such a revival is the government's
approach to health and safety. Rather than institute more rigorous inspections
and a stricter legal framework for businesses’ operations, state officials
have preferred simply to issue fewer permits to vendors.

To rescue the vanishing local street food culture, a number of civic groups
have proposed a food-cart program, [urging the
government](http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1039485) to re-issue “hawker
licenses” to grassroots street venders. The grassroots scheme only requires
around US$1,000 start-up costs and it proposes a modified-bicycle-style cart
that accommodates the city's urban landscape.
