A table showing the new Kazakh alphabet, as published on the presidential
website.

A [website](http://mening-atym.kz/) in Kazakhstan is showing users how their
names will look in a new Latin alphabet expected to come into force by 2022.
Many have reacted with dismay after finding their names laced with
apostrophes.

Nine of the 32 letters in the new alphabet have apostrophes, leaving some that
initially supported [the switch to Latin from
Cyrillic](https://globalvoices.org/2017/09/17/exploring-identities-
kazakhstans-planned-shift-to-the-latin-alphabet/) for the Turkic-family Kazakh
language regretting the move.

Not that citizens of the authoritarian country were ever consulted: the move
is the brainchild of self-styled moderniser President Nursultan Nazarbayev,
77.

After Nazarbayev announced the beginning of preparations for the switch that
will see Kazakhstan eventually spelled Qazaqstan in Kazakh, the humble Kazakh
carrot became a hotly-discussed topic on social networks.

As an article in the Economist
[explained,](https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730917-its-going-take-lot-
diacritical-marks-kazakhstan-wants-kazakh-written-latin-not) there were
reasons for avoiding other, less punctuated versions of the Latin alphabet,
such as the one initially floated:

> Delighted critics pointed out that the rendering of the Kazakh word for
> carrot in that alphabet would have been saebiz, which looks a bit like a
> transliteration of the Russian for “f**k off”.

The Russian government-run outlet Sputnik noted that even in the latest
iteration, there are plenty of words that [might look rude](http://ru.sputnik-
tj.com/asia/20171031/1023755208/kak-otreagirovali-zhiteli-kazahstana-
apostrof.html) to people with a knowledge of Russian.

Such quirks are perhaps inevitable, and Cyrillic will still be the alphabet of
choice for millions of Russian-speakers across the country. But the issue of
apostrophe proliferation in Kazakh remains pertinent.

To get an idea of what is bothering Kazakhs, Global Voices ran ourselves
through the Latin-Cyrillic-Kazakh Latin alphabet treadmill to see how we
looked when we came out the other side.

The methodology is simple. First imagine how your current name would have
appeared on a birth certificate if you had been born in Kazakhstan, which was
part of the Soviet Union before 1991.

To do this, use a Latin to Cyrillic converter such as the one available on the
[Lexilogos “multilingual
keyboard”](http://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/russian_conversion.htm). Then use
the [Cyrillic to Kazakh Latin converter](http://mening-atym.kz/) in order to
find out how many apostrophes your name collects.

[Juan Tadeo](https://globalvoices.org/author/j-tadeo/), our authority on all
things Mexico would be Хуан Тадео in Cyrillic. But in Kazakh Latin his name
becomes Hy'an Tadeo, a single apostrophe effort with a somewhat Chinese
flavour.

The apostrophes begin to really take over when Global Voices Managing Director
[Georgia Popplewell](https://globalvoices.org/author/georgia-popplewell/), or
Djordji'i'a Poppely'ell gets involved. And they go through the roof for our
Uganda hand [Prudence Nyamishana](https://globalvoices.org/author/prudence-
nyamishana/) (Pry'dence Ni'ami's'ana).

Curiously, however, our Global Voices Lingua director [Mohamed
ElGohary](https://globalvoices.org/author/mohamed-elgohary/) comes through the
Alphabet Soup completely unscathed. It seems he is our translations chief for
a reason…
