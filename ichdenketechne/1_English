As [Pope Benedict XVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI)‘s
controversial visit to Cuba draws closer, online discussion is heating up,
even as the country plunges into what Havana Times describes as [“Catholic
fervor”](http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=64681), ostensibly in an effort “to
bring renewed preferential status to a once ostracized institution and gain
new devotees.”

The post explains:

> The renewed status of the Catholic Church in Cuba comes at a time when the
> government has sought allies to implement its economic reforms while
> maintaining strict Communist Party political control over the population.
>
> The resurgence of the Catholic Church of Cuba represents a big change over
> the first decades of the Cuban revolution when being an outward follower of
> the Catholic Church or any other religious institution meant being
> blacklisted at work places, educational centers and in neighborhoods.
>
> Since 1992, Cuban citizens who practice a religion have been allowed to be
> members of the Communist Party and are no longer discriminated against by
> the government because of their religious beliefs.

But it is that apparent partnership between communism and Catholicism that is
upsetting so many netizens, especially in light of [reportedly
ongoing](http://babalublog.com/2012/03/with-papal-visit-quickly-approaching-
castro-regime-cranks-up-repression-on-dissidents/) [human
rights](http://translatingcuba.com/?p=16659) abuses and other [surreptitious
methods of curtailing personal
freedoms](http://marcmasferrer.typepad.com/uncommon_sense/2012/03/castro-
regime-turns-off-cell-phone-service-for-oscarbiscet-his-wife-elsamorejon-
cuba.html). To emphasize this point, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo at Translating
Cuba, [republishes the Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Christ and
Communism](http://translatingcuba.com/?p=16643), which he calls “obligatory
reading”.

The actions of the Cuban government have not gone unnoticed by
[babalu](http://babalublog.com/2012/03/with-papal-visit-quickly-approaching-
castro-regime-cranks-up-repression-on-dissidents/), who says that over the
weekend:

> The Castro dictatorship sent throngs of violent and insulting thugs to
> attack prominent dissidents on the island. The home of one of the leaders of
> the Ladies in White Laura Pollan was surrounded by a government controlled
> mob to threaten and intimidate the Ladies in White to make sure they do not
> mess with the theatrical performance the regime, the Church in Cuba, and the
> Vatican have planned for the Pope's visit. As of yesterday, their leader,
> Berta Soler, along with several other Ladies in White, have disappeared.
>
> The closer the date of the visit by Pope Benedict XVI to Cuba comes, the
> Cuban dictatorship is becoming more nervous and aggressive.

This, on the heels of [Cardinal Jaime Ortega's stance against 13 church
protesters](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/17/cuba-bloggers-respond-
to-archbishops-action/), makes several bloggers uncomfortable. Of the
Archbishop of Havana's action, [Without
Evasion](http://sinevasionen.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/the-protest-of-thirteen-
others/) says:

> I don’t understand how you can serve Christ, defender of his people and
> indeed dissident in his time, while protecting only the powerful. Doesn’t
> the Cuban Catholic Church grant privilege to those who suffer the most?
> Aren’t dissidents precisely who are most in need of protection under
> dictatorship conditions? Why haven’t senior representatives of the clergy
> never dedicated a Mass in memory of such a worthy and admirable Cuban, Laura
> Pollán, or to Orlando Zapata or Wilman Villar, and have instead made fervent
> wishes for the health of that other bellicose and foreign leader, Hugo
> Chávez? Doesn’t that amount to taking political positions?
>
> At this point, it is too hypocritical to pretend that all is well in Cuba,

Similarly, the action makes [babalu](http://babalublog.com/2012/03/vatican-
triples-down-on-cardinal-ortega-and-castro-dictatorship/) come to the
conclusion that the Vatian is “tripl[ing] down on Cardinal Ortega and Castro
dictatorship”:

> [Double

The Vatican's [statement](http://repeatingislands.com/2012/03/18/vatican-rips-
cuba-embargo/) on the [US/Cuba
embargo](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/29/cuba-u-s-a-blogger-
perspectives-on-the-embargos-50th-anniversary-part-1/) is proving to be just
another irritant to the online community, with
[babalu](http://babalublog.com/2012/03/pope-ordained-a-cuba-expert-denounces-
sanctions-against-cuba-you-will-never-guess-how-the-pope-viewed-sanctions-
against-south-africa/) noting the marked difference in the Vatican's stance
when it came to trade embargos against South Africa:

> As a public service by Babalu blog we'll again compare Apartheid South
> Africa's ‘crimes against humanity’ to Castroite Cuba's:
>
> According to Anti-Apartheid activists a grand total of 3000 political
> prisoners passed through South Africa’s Robben Island prison in roughly 30
> years under the Apartheid regime. Usually about 1000 were held. These were
> out of a South African population of 40 million. In its day, the regime
> responsible for these incarcerations weathered a relentless campaign of
> vituperation from every political, press and academic pulpit on the face of
> the earth until economic sanctions by practically every nation on the face
> of the earth battered, crippled and finally finished it.
>
> According to the Human Rights group, Freedom House, a grand total of 500,000
> political prisoners have passed through Stalinist Cuba's various prisons and
> forced-labor camps, mostly during the 60's and 70's. At one time in 1961,
> 300,000 Cubans were jailed for political offenses. This was out of a Cuban
> population in 1960 of 6.4 million. Among these people are THE LONGEST
> SUFFERING POLITICAL PRISONERS IN MODERN HISTORY.

In the meantime, crackdowns are apparently continuing.
[Babalu](http://babalublog.com/2012/03/over-seventy-of-cubas-ladies-in-white-
arrested-by-cuban-regime-yesterday/) says that:

> Yesterday, over seventy members of Cuba's Ladies in White, a peaceful human
> rights group made up entirely of wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters of
> Cuban political prisoners, were arrested by Cuban State Security as they
> silently marched down the streets of Cuba. It was the final culmination of

Referring to the same incident, [Notes from the Cuban Exile
Quarter](http://cubanexilequarter.blogspot.com/2012/03/nine-years-later-
another-cuban-black.html) wonders whether actions like these could be
indicative of “another Cuban [Black
Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spring_\(Cuba\))“:

> Today, nine years later thanks to the sacrifice of the Ladies in White the

Blogging from Havana, [Iván's File
Cabinet](http://desdelahabanaivan.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/cuba-will-receive-
the-pope-with-a-bath-of-masses/) notes that Cuba is preparing to receive the
pope with a “bath of masses”, which he explains is “something exclusive to the
olive-green revolution”, ending by saying:

> The papal visit has aroused wide register of opinions in Cuba: indifference
> and applause, reviews and dislikes in a sector of the opposition and Afro-
> Cuban religions, because the Holy Father is scheduled to meet with them.
>
> Whether Benedict XVI’s visit will make history, as his predecessor John Paul
> II’s did, remains to be seen. But you can be assured that this Vicar of
> Christ will be treated to a bath of masses. And sound. As only a regime that
> has made the public acts a registered trademark knows how.
>
> From his Popemobile and in the two masses he will officiate in Cuba, the
> Pope will see hundreds of thousands people. While on the island only 10% of
> the population practices Catholicism. One detail that the German pope should
> not overlook.
