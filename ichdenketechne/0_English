Myanmar has been implementing a lot of reforms in the past years which
included the [release](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/01/myanmar-a-
year-after-suu-kyis-release/) from prison of democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi,
the suspension of a controversial
[dam](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/05/myanmar-president-suspends-
dam-project/) project and the unprecedented
[release](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/01/14/myanmars-beautiful-friday-
the-13th/) of hundreds of political prisoners. And now, it's time for by-
elections.

Two major parties namely National League for Democracy (NLD) which is led by
Aung San Suu Kyi and Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) dominated
by former military generals are competing for all 45 places in parliament
while some other parties such as The Democratic Party, New National Democracy
Party (NDP), National Unity Party (NUP) and so on are competing for fewer
places.

Myanmar Facebook users are overwhelmed with different news regarding the
election which is coincidentally on April Fools’ Day.

were believed to have been forced to attend a speech event comparing to NLD's
massive success in campaign activities, since the lion is the icon of USDP and
the peacock is that of NLD.

[claimed](https://www.facebook.com/demo.fatty/posts/10150652221521374) [my]
that the USDP tried to give away a shirt and a cap to a beggar in Mandalay and
he declined to accept the gifts. Some

Campaign Activity") [my] that a USDP member in Tadar Oo, Mandalay kept on
insulting NLD with loud speakers for a whole night.

Despite the best efforts made by USDP, majority of people are eagerly
supporting NLD even though not all of them are eligible to vote for this by-

Facebook") [my] made on Facebook, 974 people said they are going to vote for
NLD while only 24 people chose USDP.
