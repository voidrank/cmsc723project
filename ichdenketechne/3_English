Starting next year, Singapore employers will have to give foreign domestic
workers one day off per week, or pay them extra to work on that day.

The new regulation was
[announced](http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2012/03/06/singapore-maids-
finally-get-a-break/?mod=WSJBlog) by Minister of State for Manpower Tan Chuan-
Jin in Parliament on 8 March 2012, and instantly attracted many responses from
people on both sides of the argument.

The campaign for a weekly day off for domestic workers – many of whom come
from less developed or poorer countries such as Myanmar, the Philippines and
Indonesia – was started in 2008 by migrant worker non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) such as TWC2, HOME and Unifem Singapore.

[Andrew Loh](http://www.publichouse.sg/categories/topstory/item/524-a-4-year-
campaign-for-a-basic-right) writes in publichouse.sg that a weekly day off is
a basic right for workers in many countries around the world:

> To the ordinary person, it was puzzling and indeed embarrassing to see that
> there was even a need to champion such a cause – a day off for workers is a
> norm in countries around the world. Singapore, sadly, was among the
> exceptions.

[Joses Kuan](http://www.publichouse.sg/categories/topstory/item/522-day-off-a-
welcome-reprieve-for-fdws) also contributed an article to publichouse.sg, and
applauds Tan Chuan-Jin for his actions:

> In my time volunteering with TWC2 back in Singapore, I had not seen a member
> of the government, much less a full minister, meaningfully engage migrant
> worker NGOs and try to effect change. BG Tan has, however, made trips down
> to TWC2’s Cuff Road Project for displaced, injured and exploited workers,
> sensitized the everyday Singaporeans to the heinous existence of
> “repatriation companies” (euphemism for legal thugs), among other
> substantive actions. This move to codify in law a mandatory off-day is
> therefore not just a simple exercise in window-dressing and BG Tan should be
> applauded for his work and direction.

However, he also warns against “premature enthusiasm”:

> This new move begs more than a few questions which remain unanswered. How
> enforceable is this legally-binding piece of legislation? Who’s going to
> police and scrutinize employers and make sure they comply? What about
> reprisals for transgression? How qualitatively different is it going to be
> from the current “standard contracts” which already are instituted (that
> disproportionately favour employers who can “buy off” discretionary off
> days)? How about bargaining power or employer-employee dynamics in a new
> milieu which usually gravitate towards the employer; and are compounded by
> issues of bad debt, agent loans to service and the impounding of passports.

Complaints and criticism began to pour in from employers opposed to the weekly
day off. A number of them wrote in to the Straits Times forum, citing
different reasons from extra pressure on Singaporean employers to increased
social ills.

[Thng Tien
Guan](http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/OnlineStory/STIStory_774534.html)
also suggested that weekly day off for domestic workers might be detrimental
to Singapore's tourism industry:

> Many maids gather in big groups along Orchard Road on their days off, and
> some of these groups can be rowdy. What would be the impact on tourism?
>
> The sudden government decision on having a weekly day off for maids, an
> important issue affecting families, is disappointing.

The stream of anti-weekly day off sentiment from certain employers were
harshly criticised on Twitter:

Some have noted that the option to compensate workers with a day's pay to work
on their off day leaves room for abuse, and said that $15 – the
[suggested](http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_774757.html)
amount – was far too little.

> [@STcom](https://twitter.com/#!/STcom) The value of a day off is all the

Eddy Blaxell pointed out that it would still be possible for domestic workers
to not receive a growth in income:

> [One article claimed that maids would be paid 15%
> more](http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_774757.html),
> because most maids are paid monthly and compensation for rest days would
> have to be paid on top of their monthly salary.
>
> But these changes don't apply to existing contracts. They apply only to
> workers on work permits issued after 1 January 2013. And wages for those
> workers haven't been set yet. An employer who wants to continue hiring a
> maid on exactly the same basis as he is currently doing faces no obstacles.
> He reduces the maid's monthly salary by 15% and gives it back as
> compensation. It's as simple as that.
