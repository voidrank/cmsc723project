In Taiwan, the population of foreign workers and immigrants has been on the
rise in recent years and constitutes a significant part of Taiwanese society.
The total population in Taiwan is about [23
million;](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/taiwan-population/)
the aboriginal population makes up [about
2.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_aborigines) of the total and
there are also about [720,000 foreign
workers](http://statdb.mol.gov.tw/html/mon/212060.htm) serving in the
industrial and service sectors in Taiwan. A majority of these workers are from
Southeast Asian countries, mainly Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and
Thailand. Over the past 20 years, the number of spouses from Southeast Asia
and their children that are settling in Taiwan has grown in size to around
[200,000](https://www.ris.gov.tw/zh_TW/346).

Since 2014, the Taiwan Literature Award for Migrants has been encouraging
these foreign-born groups to express themselves in their mother tongues, an
effort that has also allowed the Taiwanese people to learn more about these
cultures and stories.

The literature award was initiated by Cheng Chang the founder and former
editor of 4-Way Voice, a printed and online magazine which publishes news
reports in Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Burmese, and Cambodian.

[Cheng Chang explained ](http://tlam.sea.taipei/about-
us-%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC%E7%A7%BB%E6%B0%91%E5%B7%A5%E6%96%87%E5%AD%B8%E7%8D%8E-2/)the
motivation behind the creation of this literature award:

>
> 自我參與《四方報》創報至今，《四方報》做為非華語系移民工資訊交流與紓解鄉愁的平台，不僅是一份服務移民工的母語刊物，更以「友人」身份，傾聽他/她們的聲音，擔起台/外文化溝通的橋樑。自出刊以來，《四方報》即收到大量來自全台各地移民工的投書，平均以每月五、六百封的數量，如雪片般累積。  
>
> 源鑒於此，我們開始考量移民工自身其實擁有創作的多樣性與豐沛能量，因此希望成立一個更具延展性的文學獎項，讓他們得以藉由書寫，替自己留下歷史，透過文字創作表達兩個故鄉（外籍配偶）、雙重血緣（新住民二代）、與異地漂流（外籍移工）的文學風貌。

> Since I founded 4-Way Voice, it has become a platform for migrant workers
> who do not speak Chinese to exchange information and express their longings
> for their home countries. It not only serves them as a news report in their
> mother tongues but it is also a friend who listens to their voices and a
> bridge that connects the Taiwanese and people from other countries. Since we
> started, 4-Way Voice has received a lot of letters from migrant workers all
> over Taiwan — on average about 5,600 letters per month. These letters
> accumulate like snowflakes.  
>  Therefore, considering the diversity and energy in their creativity, we
> planned to set up a long-standing literature award so that they can make
> their own history through writing. They can build up new literature
> traditions for stories about two home countries (for foreign spouses), about
> the offspring of two countries (for the second generation), and about
> diaspora (for migrant workers).

Currently, this literature award receives articles written in Thai,
Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. Because most of these writers are away
from their homeland, many of the stories are about the longing they feel for
their family and homeland and their sorrow when they hear of a loved one's
death.

for her parents:

> Ba ơi! Tiếng chuông đồng hồ đã điểm mười hai giờ đêm Đài Loan rồi, không

> Dad! The clock just chimed, marking midnight in Taiwan. Are you fast asleep

Some of the pieces are sad stories about their lives in Taiwan. In 2013,
several crews from Indonesia killed the Taiwanese captain of the ship. Even
though the judge in the case felt that the captain was abusive towards the
crew, the people who killed the captain were
[sentenced](https://pnn.pts.org.tw/main/2015/02/10/%E3%80%90%E7%89%B9%E5%AE%8F%E8%88%88%E6%A1%88%E3%80%91%E6%B5%B7%E4%B8%8A%E5%96%8B%E8%A1%80%E6%A1%88%E5%AE%A3%E5%88%A4-%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E6%BC%81%E5%B7%A5%E5%88%A41428%E5%B9%B4/)
to 14 to 28 years in the jail. Tania Roos from Indonesia [wrote a
story](http://tlam.sea.taipei/2017/06/27/surat-rindu-dari-balik-jeruji/)
telling us about the fictionalized crew:

> Awalnya mereka hanya ingin memberi pelajaran agar Kapten merasa kapok dan
> babak belur saja. Ketika Kapten lengah, sebuah pukulan besi tumpul dari
> tangan Sardi melayang menghantam tengkuknya. Kapten terkapar. Mengetahui
> lawannya tak berkutik, Wasto dan kawan-kawannya terduduk lemas. Mereka puas
> karena telah membuat Kapten pingsan.  
>  Sejurus kemudian, Sardi iseng mendekati Kapten yang tertelentang berlumuran
> darah. Dengan teriakan keras, Sardi mundur dua langkah. Lemas dan terduduk.
> Ia tak mampu berkata apa-apa. Hanya menunjukkan kepada kawan-kawannya jika
> Kapten tidak bernapas lagi.  
>  Mengetahui hal tersebut, para ABK mulai panik. Ada yang memeriksa nadi
> Kapten. Ada pula yang mendekatkan telinga ke dada untuk mendengar napasnya.
> Ada yang menduga Kapten sedang pingsan. Ada pula yang menangis karena
> ketakutan. Mendengar kepanikan itu, dua orang dari ruang kemudi turut ke
> luar dan terbelalak mengetahui kejadian yang sebenarnya.  
>  Kapten benar-benar meninggal. Juru mudi melaporkan kejadian ini kepada pos
> keamanan terdekat. “Kami dijemput polisi air dan akhirnya harus menjalani
> sidang-sidang yang melelahkan, hingga vonis dijatuhkan. Itu kejadian yang
> sebenarnya, Bu, kami sangat emosi. Kami sudah di ujung kesabaran.” Ungkap
> Wasto lirih. Matanya berkaca-kaca.

> At first, they just wanted to let the captain know that he was wrong and to
> teach him a lesson. However, when he wasn't looking, an iron rod, held by
> Sardi, accidentally hit the captain on the back of his head. He fell down.
> Learning that their opponent rendered immobile, Wasto and his buddies
> slumped. They were satisfied to knock him out unconscious.  
>  Soon after, Sardi approached the blood-covered body of the captain.
> Howling, Sardi took two steps back. Limped and slumped. He was rendered
> speechless. To his buddies, he pointed to the direction of the lifeless
> captain.
>
> Learning that, the crew was in panic. Someone checked the captain's pulse.
> Another was trying to hear his breathing. Another thought that he was just
> unconscious. Another was crying in fear. Hearing the frenzy, two men went
> out of the steering room. Their eyes were broadened after figuring out what
> happened. The captain was truly dead. The navigator informed the nearby
> maritime police station.  
>  The Maritime Police took us away, followed by many tiring trials, and
> finally the sentence was announced. This is what really happened, ma'am. We
> were enraged, we had reached the limit of our patience.’ Wasto said softly,
> with tears in his eyes.

Lê Hoàng Hiệp is a graduate student from Vietnam and he [wrote a
story](http://tlam.sea.taipei/2017/04/23/%E9%BE%8D%E7%9C%BC%E6%88%90%E7%86%9F%E6%99%82-mua-

> Chiều nay, sau khi tan buổi trực ở sở di dân, Dung chạy xe qua trường đón

>  – Con của mẹ thật giỏi, để mẹ sẽ dạy con nói thêm nhiều tiếng Việt nha

> This afternoon, after finishing her job in the immigration office, Dung went

Some stories are about tragic incidents that shocked the whole country. In
2014, a [mass stabbing
spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Taipei_Metro_attack) took place in
the Taipei Metro and Erin, from Indonesia, [wrote a
story](http://tlam.sea.taipei/2017/05/06/%E6%B1%9F%E5%AD%90%E7%BF%A0%E7%9A%84%E5%8B%87%E5%A3%AB-

Nanik Riyati is from Indonesia and she [wrote a story about the
hijab:](http://tlam.sea.taipei/2017/04/11/%E8%AA%A0%E5%AF%A6%E8%88%87%E9%A0%86%E5%BE%9E-kejujuran-
dan-hijabku/)

> Suatu hari Siauce mendapatiku berhijab. Mimik wajahnya menunjukkan
> ketidaksukaannya dan menyuruhku untuk melepaskannya. Dia masuk ke kamar dan
> memanggilku sambil membuka youtube dan menjelaskan tentang adat upacara
> kematian orang Cina.  
>  Dengan kesedihan dan kekecewan terpaksa ku lepas hijabku dan berpakaian
> seperti biasa, tetapi dalam hati, aku tetap berkeinginan untuk berhijab dan
> menjadi muslimah yang baik.  
>  Aku mulai istikamah berdoa dan berusaha mencari informasi bagaimana caranya
> agar bisa berhijab menjalankan perintah Allah dan tetap bekerja dengan baik.
> Rasa iri dan sedih setiap kali melihat teman-teman bisa bebas berhijab
> selalu terbesit. Dalam hati hanya bisa berucap, “Ya Allah semoga suatu saat
> aku diperbolehkan berhijab”.[…]  
>  Tiba-tiba aku teringat akan surat yang Ah-kong tulis buatku. Maka di sela-
> sela kesibukan mengerjakan tugas kuliah, kutulis sebuah surat dengan bahasa
> Inggris dengan vocabulary yang pas-pasan dan grammarnya yang tidak lengkap.
> Akan tetapi aku yakin Siauce memahami isi suratku.  
>  Ku jelaskan kewajiban wanita muslimah untuk berhijab itu diperintahkan
> langsung oleh Allah dan keutamaan wanita yang berhijab dan taat beragama
> pasti akan lebih sabar dalam mengurus orang tua, lebih ikhlas dalam bekerja
> dan jujur.  
>  Selesai kerja kuberikan surat yang sudah kupersiapkan dan aku masuk kamar
> untuk melaksanakan salat isya. Tiba-tiba pintu kamar terbuka, Siauce berlari
> memelukku dengan erat sambil menangis. Diciuminya rambutku sambil berkata:  
>  “You can wear hijab. You can wear your dress. You can pray, you can study,
> you can do anything you like, but don’t leave us and please take care of Ah-
> kong, because he loves you and likes you. If this was your reason to go home
> please stay here and do as your Allah asked you to do. I allow you and I
> will explain to Ah-kong and my brother.”  
>  “If you have something to talk, just tell me and we can communicate”.  
>  Spontan aku bersujud dan menangis. Ku peluk erat tubuh Siauce, ku anggukkan
> kepala dan aku setuju untuk menambah kontrakku, di samping aku bisa
> melanjutkan kuliahku dan melunasi hutang-hutangku. Terima kasih ya Allah,
> ternyata benar, kalau kita berdoa dengan istiqamah, berusaha tanpa henti
> Allah pasti akan mengabulkan doa kita.

> One day, the daughter of my boss saw me wear hijab. She looked unhappy and
> told me to take it off. She asked me to go to her room and let me see a

>  I started to pray and looked for any way to obey Allah and kept doing my

>  Suddenly, I remember the letter grandpa wrote to me. When I was busy doing
> homework assigned in the school, I wrote to the daughter of my boss in
> simple English. I believe she can understand what I wrote in the letters. I
> explained the duty of Muslims. Wearing hijab is an order from Allah, and it
> is the most important principle for women to obey the religion, which will
> make me more patient to take care of her grandpa, kinder, and more honest.  
>  After finishing my duty, I gave her the letter I prepared, and then I came
> back to my room and prayed. Suddenly my door was opened, she ran in and held
> me. She kissed my hairs and said, ‘You can wear hijab. You can wear your

And finally, Filipina Wala's [beautiful

> Gusto kong maging hinog sa karanasan sa buhay dito upang maibahagi ko rin

>  Ang puso ko ay pinagtibay na ng hangaring matupad ang aking mga pangarap at
