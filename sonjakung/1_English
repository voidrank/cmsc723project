On Thursday, January 11, United States President Donald Trump generated
instant [controversy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-
shithole-countries.html?_r=0&mtrref=t.co) when he
[reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-
protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-
meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html?utm_term=.788dc9635018)
referred to Haiti, El Salvador and countries in Africa as “[shithole
countries](http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/politics/trump-wsj-
interview/index.html).” While many newsrooms in the English-language world
[debated](http://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-jan-11-2018) whether or not to reprint the
US president's expletive, journalists working in other languages struggled to
properly translate the word “shithole”. Japanese media was no exception.

While many English speakers will immediately grasp the meaning of the term
used by the President, for non-English speakers the nuances of the word
“shithole” can be hard to grasp. [The Oxford Dictionary defines the word
as](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shithole) “an extremely
dirty, shabby, or otherwise unpleasant place.”

However, some major Japanese media outlets chose to use a direct translation
of the word. For example, both the [Asahi
Shimbun](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASL1D3C5YL1DUHBI00H.html), a major
Japanese daily newspaper, and
[Jiji](https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2018011200325&g=use), one of the
country's main wire services, translated “shithole” as “benjo” (便所), a crude
word for “lavatory” that could be translated as “shitter.”

But there seemed to be no consensus in the Japanese media about how to
translate the President's vulgarity.

William Mallard, Reuters's Japan bureau chief documented the various
translations for “shithole” that appeared in the Japanese media, as well as
the Japanese-language editions of overseas media, and his tweet, in turn,
sparked a Twitter discussion among other journalists and observers:

Mallard noted that the most common translation he encountered was “night-soil
pit”, or “koudame” (肥溜め), a hole [long used by Japanese
farmers](https://www.google.ca/search?q=%E8%82%A5%E3%81%A0%E3%82%81%E3%81%AE&rlz=1CALEAO_enCA762CA762&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_4tSY3dPYAhVU92MKHceoAHQQ_AUICigB&biw=1366&bih=694)
to collect human excrement as fertilizer. Mallard, writing in Japanese,
hypothesized this word was used because the word “shit hole”, directly
translated into Japanese, would seem to mean a “hole for storing shit”, as
farmers once did.

Other commenters questioned translating Trump's description of some Caribbean,
Central American and African countries as “night-soil pits” (肥溜め), while other
commentators continued to document variations on the word “shithole” in
Japanese.

A more precise definition was offered:

Damian Flanagan, a prominent translator of Japanese books also suggested that
[Botchan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botchan), one of the classics of
Japanese literature, provides a useful translation for the US President's
vulgar language:

> Japanese should eschew direct translation of “shithole” and turn to

> (不浄な地を離れた) Love graceful phrase “不浄な地” (“impure place”) to make comeback.

## Disgust with Trump's racist, vulgar language

However, others paid more attention to the intent of Trump's words, rather
than how to translate them.

Prominent Japanese documentary filmmaker Soda Kazuhiro, in a tweet that was
shared hundreds of times, said that the “shithole” in question is inside
Trump's brain.

>
> トランプが議員との懇談で、ハイチやアフリカの国を「Shithole（肥溜め）みたいな国」と発言。そして肥溜めみたいな国よりも、ノルウェーみたいな国から移民を受け入れろと言ったらしい。肥溜めみたいなのはトランプの頭の中だと思う。クソみたいな考えや発言しか出てこない。

Reaction to Trump's language was strong around the world and in the United
States.

Former Canadian governor general and current secretary general of the
Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, Michaelle Jean, who was born
in Haiti, called Trump remarks [an “insult before
humanity.”](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/trumps-remarks-on-
african-countries-haiti-insulting-michaelle-
jean/article37592870/?click=sf_globefb)

Jamie Stelter, a popular media personality in New York City and spouse of
prominent American media commentator [Brian
Stelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Stelter) tweeted:

[Author Jonathan M. Katz](https://jonathanmkatz.com/bigtruck/), who has
written a book documenting the United Nations response to the 2010 earthquake
that devastated Haiti, explained that Haiti's standard of living is lower than
that of the U.S. as a direct result of historical American policies towards
the Caribbean country:

> In order to do a victory lap around the GDP difference between, say, Norway
> and Haiti, you have to know nothing about the history of the world.

> That includes, especially, knowing nothing real about the history of the
> United States.

In a post shared thousands of times, one Twitter user summed up the discussion
of the word “shithole” by pointing what has largely been ignored — the overt
racism of Trump's remark:

> Fascinating that media outlets find it easier to print “shithole” than
> “racist” or “racism”.
