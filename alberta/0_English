Nour is a Lebanese actress who has been starring in Egyptian films for the
last 10 years. She is always considered as one of the prettiest actresses of
her age. Lately, Egyptian newspaper “ _El Youm El Sabee_ ” (The Seventh Day)
[reported
[Ar]](http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=259997&SecID=48&IssueID=0) that
Nour gave birth to a baby boy and called him “Leonardo”. The child's name
helped reveal the religion of the actress, which shocked some of those who
left comments on the article there.

An anonymous reader left the following comment under the screen name “Masdoom”
(Shocked):

هى مسيحة!

Is she Christian!?

Another reader replied to Masdoom:

شكلها مسيحيه بس انا مش عارف اتمنى انها تاسلم يوما ما

She seems to be Christian, I am not really sure. I hope she converts to Islam
someday.

And a third reader called “Asmaa” said:

انا كنت بحبها لكن بعد ما عرفت انها مسيحية كرهتها

I used to like her, but after I knew she's Christian I hated her.

Readers left more than 100 comments on the article. Some where just shocked,
and some others like the following reader tried to urge people to be more
reasonable:

وفيها ايه لما تبقى مسيحيه وفيها ايه لما اتفرج على ممثل مسيحى ده سيدنا محمد
عليه الصلاة والسلام تزوج من مسيحيه واوصى بهم خيرا

What's the problem with her being Christian, or watching a Christian
actor/actress!? Even Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) was married to a
Christian woman and ordered us to be good to Christians.

Traveller Within wrote the following tweet mocking people's reaction after
knowing Nour's religion:

@[TravellerW](http://twitter.com/TravellerW/status/20546221926): الناس
المتضايقة ان نور مسيحية كان عندهم أمل يروحوا يتجوزوها مثلا و دلوقتي الموضوع
فركش بسبب الدين؟ :)

@[TravellerW](http://twitter.com/TravellerW/status/20546221926): Why are
people sad that she is Christian. Were they planning to marry her, and now
they can't because of her religion? :)

In fact, it seems that even Nour herself – whose real name is “ _[Marianne
Phillip Abi Habib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_%28actress%29)_ ” – was
aware of this, and either she or her producers decided to give her a new
screen name that doesn't reveal her religion.

It's not only Nour, but [another Egyptian Actress – Basma – was subject to
rumours a while ago that her grandparents are
Jews](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2010/04/unfriendly-fire.html).
People then had mixed feelings towards such news.

In his blog “[ _The Egyptian Silent
Majority_](http://theegyptiansilentmajority.blogspot.com/2010/07/blog-
post_20.html)” blogger Ahmed Samir wrote about an incident that happened to
him some time ago and made him realize how much people are obsessed with
knowing other people's religion.

He wrote:

سألتني زوجتي فجأة:  
“هو المذيع………..مسلم و لا مسيحي”؟؟  
(المذيع المقصود مذيع اذاعي بصوت مميز يقدم احد البرامج العاطفية على محطة من
محطات ال FM)  
جاويتها….(لا طبعااا…مسلم…..مســــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــلم طبعا…..دايما
بيستشهد بالدين في برنامجه….لا و كمااااااااان ايه..دة دايما يهنىء المسيحيين
بأعيادهم بقوله “اخواننا المسيحيين”)  
لا…مسيحي ازاي…..؟؟ لا ممكن ابدااا  
عموما نتأكد من الإنترنت….حتما و لابد عنده معلومة في هذا الشأن  
و لســـــــــة بكتب إسم الرجل على جوجل لأفاجأ ان (جوجل) بيكمل لي السؤال  
“……………مسلم أو مسيحي؟”  
لأكتشف ان السؤال دة لا يشغلها هي وحدها انما شغل ناس كتيـــــــــــــر قبلها
على الإنترنت!!!

My wife asked me out of the blue whether that radio host is Muslim or
Christian.  
(I am referring here to that presenter with a distinctive voice who presents a
relationship advice show on one of the FM radio stations)  
I answered her: No of course, he is a Muslim. He's Muslim for sure. He usually
refers to Islamic values and laws on his show, and when he refers to
Christians he calls them “Our Christian brothers/sisters”. He can't be a
Christian, surely not. Anyway, let's see if the internet can confirm this
information.  
I went to write the guy's name in Google to find out that Google automatically
completed my questions, and added “is he a Muslim or Christian?”  
I realized then that it's not only my wife, but many others have gone to find
an answer for the same question online before us.

He then continued:

لقد اكتشفت اننا شعب مهوووس بالديانات….بتفرق معاه قوي الشخص دة مسلم و لا
مسيحي…..؟  
…  
علامات استفهام رهيبة و مثلها من علامات التعجب عن المغزى من هذه الأسئلة…و هل
تنال ديانة المشهور من شعبيته و شهرته؟؟؟  
و ما سبب هذه الطائفية الرهيبة التي تحملها هذه النوعية من الأسئلة..؟؟؟  
و هل وصلت مجتمعاتنا الى درجة رهيبة من التطرف لدرجة ان تحكم على الشخص من خلال
ديانته…لا من خلال اخلاقه او أعماله؟؟  
و إذا كانت كل هذه الأسئلة تتم بدافع (الفضول) و ليس ال(التطرف) فهل وصل (الفضول)
الى هذه الدرجـــــــة؟!!  
…  
فلقد ضبطت نفسي (متلبسا) بتهمة (التفاهة) و (السطحية) و الأمر اني قد اكتشفت اني
لست بمفردي على هذه الشاكلة بل ان أمري يهون بجانب الكثيرين قبلي قد قرروا ان
يفتشوا في ضمائر الناس و دياناتهم و ان يبنوا قناعاتهم و مدى حبهم لهذا النجم او
ذاك بديانته و يقرروا مدى تعلقهم به و حبهم له بذهابه للجامع أم للكنيسة؟؟!!

I realized that we are obsessed with religion, and it really matters to us
whether a certain person is Muslim or Christian.  
…  
Many questions and exclamation marks are wandering in my mind now. Does a
person's religion effect his fame and popularity? What is the reason behind
this sectarianism that carried us to ask such questions?  
Has our society reached such a point of extreme sectarianism that we judge
people by their religions instead of their morals and deeds? And if such
questions are due to curiosity and not sectarianism, why are we that curious
to know?  
…  
I caught myself charged with shallowness and silliness, but it's not only me,
or else it would have been easier, many others before me decided to search
into people's beliefs and base their love and hatred towards celebrities based
on their religions, and decide to love or hate them based on whether they go
to a mosque or a church on the weekend.

Charafantah [wrote a list of more than 15 questions
[ar]](http://www.charafantah.com/?p=531) each one should ask himself in order
to know whether he is racist or not. And one of those questions was whether
your opinion in someone changes after you know his/her religion.

انطباعك عن حد بيتغير لما تعرف دينه؟

Does your opinion in people change after you know their religion?

Finally, just as Ahmed Samir said in his post, it's not always racism or
sectarianism, but sometimes it's just curiosity that makes us eager to know
other people's religions, yet why are we that curious to know? Why do we even
care to know? Will such information make any difference to us?
