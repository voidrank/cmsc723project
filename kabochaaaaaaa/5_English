Conservationists are upbeat about Nepal slated to become the [first country to
double its wild tiger numbers](http://www.hakahakionline.com/en/5146/nepal-
set-to-become-first-country-to-double-wild-tiger-population/) by 2022. On
National Conservation Day, September 23, 2018, Nepal announced that it has 235
tigers living in the wild. In 2009, there were only 121 tigers in Nepal.

In 2010, at the Tiger Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, the Government of
Nepal along with the governments of India, Russia, Nepal, and Bhutan [pledged
to double the number of tigers](https://globalvoices.org/2016/05/25/a-flurry-
of-poaching-cases-casts-a-cloud-over-nepals-tiger-conservation-efforts/) by
2022.

Tigers, revered in Hindu mythology as the mount of
[Durga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga), Goddess of Power, have always
been a guarded species. As symbols of power and courage, tigers have [faced
threats ](http://www.wwfnepal.org/what_we_do/wildlife/tiger/)due to a
declining prey population, poaching, and destruction and degradation of their
habitats.

Once, [nine tiger species](http://www.wwfnepal.org/what_we_do/wildlife/tiger/)
(Bengal, Siberian, Indo-Chinese, South Chinese, Sumatran, Malayan, Caspian,
Javan, and Bali) roamed in 13 countries, ranging from Turkey to several
nations in Southeast Asia. Out of these, the Caspian, Javan and Bali tigers
are already extinct. Nepal is known for its Bengal tigers.

In the early 1900s, around [100,000 tigers
](https://www.nepalitimes.com/banner/how-many-tigers-in-nepal/)roamed in the
wild. Today, the estimated tiger population is around 3,900 globally. India
boasts [2,226 wild tigers](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-
the-greatest-number-of-wild-tigers.html) — the highest number in the world.

Tigers are found in Nepal’s Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park, Banke
National Park, Shuklaphanta National Park, and Parsa National Park. Earlier,
Nepal’s [Chitwan National Park](https://globalvoices.org/2015/02/17/nepal-is-
home-to-the-worlds-leading-tiger-conservation-park/) was declared the first
park in the world to be accredited by Conservation Assured Tiger Standards
([CA|TS](http://www.conservationassured.org/cats_wp/about-cats-tiger-
protection/)) in the year 2015.

### **Cumbersome counting**

Tigers are [difficult to
track](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/assessing-tiger-
population/) because of their elusive nature. According to noted tiger expert
Dr. K. Ullas Karanth, in the 1960s, officials in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and
Russia assumed that just as human fingerprints are unique, paws of a tiger
must differ. They thought they could count tigers by [counting their
tracks,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-trouble-with-tiger-
numbers/) but the method was flawed.

With technological advancements, tigers these days are counted by their unique
stripe pattern on their flanks, automatically captured by camera traps placed
along tiger trails. The following video reveals how tigers were counted in
Nepal, where over 300 field workers spent 16,811 days with 1,643 camera traps
and then analyzed tigers’ stripes based on the footage:

However, back in 2016, Dr. Karanth expressed skepticism about the counting
method in his article “[The Trouble with Tiger
Numbers](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-trouble-with-tiger-
numbers/)“:

> These groups (the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum) aim to increase the number
> of tigers to 6,000 by 2022. But their tally, based on official estimates,
> relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak
> extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.

### **Tiger conservation initiatives in Nepal**

Nepal has led the global tiger conservation movement with recent census
results showing increased tiger numbers.

The Government of Nepal, together with conservation partners, has initiated
several measures to save these magnificent species. According to the paper
“[Tiger Conservation Initiatives in
Nepal”](https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/INIT/article/view/5537/0), Nepal has
established the National Tiger Conservation Committee and the South Asia
Wildlife Enforcement Network.

Nepal has also signed a memorandum of understanding with China for
biodiversity conservation focused on curbing illicit wildlife trade, including
tiger parts. Nepal’s declaration of Banke National Park as a protected area
has also provided larger territory for the tigers. Estimating the abundance of
tigers and its prey base (the availability of food in any given habitat to
support a predator) will help assess the effectiveness of conservation
interventions and formulate plans for future management.

Additional measures [have been
crucial](https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/protecting-wild-tigers-in-nepal/)
for increasing tiger numbers such as training park and protection staff to use
real-time [SMART](https://www.worldwildlife.org/projects/wildlife-crime-
technology-project) (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool) technologies and
the formation of community-based anti-poaching operations to enhance
patrolling.

Grassland management has also been crucial for conservation. With the
construction of wetlands, wild tigers have access to their own water sources,
even in the dry season, instead of dipping into water supplies used by humans
in the buffer zone. With the construction of fire lines, dug trenches avoid
spreading forest fires, protecting wild animals including tigers.

For now, Nepali tiger experts are optimistic about Nepal doubling its tiger
numbers by 2022. It just needs 15 more tigers to reach its goal in the next
four years!
