The legislator, Kuo-Chang Huang, is at risk of a recall because of his support
for same-sex marriage. (Photo credit: Kuo-Chang Huang's facebook profile

Taiwan became [the first Asian country](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-
way/2017/05/24/529841027/taiwans-high-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-is-legal-
in-a-first-for-asia) to embrace same-sex marriage in May 2017 after its
Council of Grand Justices [ruled](https://globalvoices.org/2017/05/25/history-
in-the-making-taiwan-to-become-first-asian-country-to-recognise-gay-marriage/)
that regulations that prohibit marriage between same-sex partners are
unconstitutional. The court asserted that the regulations violate rights to
the freedom of marriage and equality among citizens and gave the legislature
two years create new laws.

Yet the path of legal reform is rocky. Conservative groups are seeking a
referendum campaign to recall legislators who are trying to enact the court’s
decision. These recall election campaigns are mobilized by the [Stable Force
Alliance](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%89%E5%AE%9A%E5%8A%9B%E9%87%8F),
composed of the Faith and Hope League, a right-wing Christian political party,
and some significant members in the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.

They are targeting, among others, the legislator [Kuo-Chang
Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Kuo-chang), the chairperson of New
Power Party, the legislator of New Taipei City 12th district since 2016. Huang
is a distinguished legal scholar and one of the leaders of the [Sunflower
Movement](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2014-special-
coverage/taiwans-congressoccupied-protests/), which helped end the rule of the
[Kuomingtang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang) in Taiwan. During his
[two years](http://www.ccw.org.tw/node/24736) in the Legislative Yuan, he has
investigated serious corruption cases. This work has angered other
conservative political forces and corrupt politicians, who hope to bring him
down.

If a well-recognized legislator like Huang were recalled because of his
support for same-sex marriage, the chilling effect might stop the progress of
the same-sex marriage bill.

Unfortunately for Huang and the same-sex marriage bill, current regulations
make electoral recall easy. Nathan Batto, a political researcher,
[explains](https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2017/11/18/huang-kuo-changs-
recall-vote/) that before the recall election regulations were revised in
2016, they required a turnout threshold of 50% of eligible voters, which made
a recall to be nearly impossible. Rules revisions removed the minimum
threshold for turnout.

The recall election for Huang will be held December 16. The Faith and Hope
League campaign is now backed by the a group calling themselves the ‘South and
North Presbyterian Churches’ and the Kaohsiung-Pingtung Alliance, who issued a
[public statement](http://krtnews.tw/chinese-church/local/article/17378.html)
on December 8. This statement gave a real boost to the anti-gay groups because
the Presbyterian Church is the largest Protestant Christian denomination in
Taiwan. This statement also ignited furious debate among members of the
Presbyterian Church, in part because the name ‘South and North Presbyterian
Churches’ has [not been
used](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E9%95%B7%E8%80%81%E6%95%99%E6%9C%83)
since they were integrated as the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan in 1950.

Mu-Min Shih, a member of the Presbyterian Church, explained on [his
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/leoforlion/posts/10210817741025595?hc_location=ufi)
page that the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan does not
endorse this statement.

> 台灣基督長老教會總會沒有議決支持罷免立法委員黃國昌。沒有官方的文書。在那一份支持罷免的聲明中聯名，具有台灣基督長老教會職分的人，全都是個人名義。

> The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church did not decide to support
> the recall election for Huang. There is no such official document. Those
> people who signed that statement with their titles affiliated to the
> Presbyterian Church are on behalf of themselves.

The Presbyterian Church Youth Alliance also
[criticized](https://www.facebook.com/2014tkcfront/) the flaws in the
democratic and bureaucratic systems in the Presbyterian church.

> 這凸顯出本陣線從結成以來一直強調的：代議制度出了問題。[…]為什麼有中會可以跳過中會議決、一切程序就花錢發文告？為什麼可以跳過總會對做政治表態？

> This raises the question that we keep asking since our Alliance was

> Why could these Presbyterians announce this statement without any discussion

If Huang is recalled it will have implications for same-sex marriage
regulations in Taiwan. The Stable Force League would likely seek to recall
other legislators who support same-sex marriage and seek to stop the same-sex
marriage bill. If this recall election fails, the Stable Force League might
dissolve, and the same-sex marriage bill would be carried out as mandated by
the top court.

Regardless of the results of this recall election, the Presbyterian Church
will face the pressure to reform. Although the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church has not issued a statement to support Huang's recall, some
feel its silence is a conspicuous gesture of approval. For example Josephine
Hsu, a member of the Presbyterian Church, therefore [called for reformation of
the
Church](https://www.facebook.com/nocturnes.jo/posts/10212649077796209?hc_location=ufi)
on her Facebook page:

>
> 總會這次沒有聲音，連「總會沒有立場沒有共識、期民眾以問政品質來評斷立委好壞、應秉持上帝的愛追求正確資訊」這種官話，至今都沒有說一句。[…]長老宗在台灣也超過150年，哪有不腐敗的？[…]任何改革，說穿了都是權力鬥爭，改革派鬥不贏，下場就是教會青年人口大量流失。

> The General Assembly keeps complete silence this time. It did not even say
> something like ‘we do not have consensus, and we hope citizens can evaluate
> the legislators by their performance, and we should pursue correct
> information for the love of God’.[…] The Presbyterian Church has been in
> Taiwan for 150 years, and it is not possible to be immune to corruption.[…]
> All reformation is power struggle. If the revolution does not succeed, young
> people will leave the Church.

December 17 update: Pro-same-sex marriage legislator Kuo-Chang Huang has
survived the recall vote on December 16. Although there were more ‘Yes’ votes
than ‘No’ votes, recall supporters were unable to mobilize 25 percent of
eligible voters to pass the threshold for a recall vote. Based on the recall
election regulations, recall supporters cannot apply for another recall
election for Huang in his term of office.
