It is a historic day: that is how many Mozambicans regard December 14, 2018
when, for the first time in the country's civil aviation history, an airplane
was operated solely by women.

The crew for flight TM112/3, which traveled between the capital, Maputo, and
Manica — an air distance of 442 miles — was captain Admira António, co-pilot
Elsa Balate, cabin chief Maria da Luz Aurélio, and flight attendant Débora
Madeleine.

The women are members of MEX, an entity originally created as the Special
Operations Department of
[LAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAM_Mozambique_Airlines) — Linhas Aéreas
de Moçambique. In 1995, it began operations as [an independent
airline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%C3%A7ambique_Expresso), Mozambique
Express.

A congratulatory Facebook status update posted by feminist activist [Eliana
Nzualo](https://www.facebook.com/eliana.nzualo/posts/10156689825850390), has
so far attracted nearly 450 comments, been shared more than 460 times, and
garnered close to 2,000 reactions:

added that women should be proud “when [they] are represented in various
sectors”:

> Na aviação há muito poucas mulheres, poucas mesmo, isto não é aqui apenas
> mas em todo mundo. Imagino as mulheres por aí a fora que julgavam ser esta
> profissão apenas para homens, devem sentir se orgulhosas.

> In aviation there are few women, very few, this is not only here but in the
> whole world. I imagine the women who thought this profession was for men
> only, should feel proud.

Mozambique is not alone. In August 2018, in a first for South Africa's
national carrier SAA, an intercontinental flight with [an all-female
crew](https://allafrica.com/stories/201808280105.html) took to the skies to
transport passengers [from Johannesburg to Sao
Paulo](https://www.enca.com/news/saa-all-female-crew-makes-history), Brazil.

Eight months earlier, in December 2017, [Ethiopian
Airlines](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/ethiopian-
airlines-all-female-flight-crew-pilots-addis-ababa-lagos-first-
africa-a8120816.html) operated its first ever flight staffed by an all-female
crew. From pilots to cabin crew, check-in staff to flight dispatchers, the
flight — from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia to Lagos in Nigeria — was (wo)manned
entirely by women.
