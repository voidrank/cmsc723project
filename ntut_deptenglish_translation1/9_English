added-to-the-list-of-intangible-cultural-heritage-of-humanity.html), Japan's
“visiting deity” folk rituals (来訪神, _raihoshin_ ) [were added to the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's Intangible
Cultural Heritage list](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20181129_35/)
in November 2018.

The rituals were added to the UNESCO list for a variety of reasons, primarily
because by performing the rituals “local people — notably children — have
their identities molded, develop a sense of affiliation to their community,”
according to UNESCO in its announcement.

Visiting deity rituals are performed in rural communities [all over
Japan](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%A5%E8%A8%AA%E7%A5%9E), typically
at the end of the year, or when seasons change, especially at summer's end and
the start of fall, and the traditional end of winter — [according to Japan's
old calendar ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calendar#Seasons)— and
the start of spring. The rituals and deities are based on folk traditions with
far older roots in Japan than Buddhism or even
[Shintoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto).

[According to UNESCO](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/raiho-shin-ritual-visits-
of-deities-in-masks-and-costumes-01271):

> Raihoshin rituals take place annually in various regions of Japan —
> especially in the Tohoku, Hokuriku, Kyushu and Okinawa regions — on days
> that mark the beginning of the year or when the seasons change. Such rituals
> stem from folk beliefs that deities from the outer world — the Raihoshin —
> visit communities and usher in the new year or new season with happiness and
> good luck.

While the rituals differ from region to region, the visiting deities are best
known as _[namahage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namahage)_, a kind of ogre
or demon. The rituals generally involve men or women dressed as namahage
demons or other raishoshin using crude costumes and masks — and sometimes
armed with knives.

Often the demons enter homes to scare children until placated with sake, beer
or a similar offering. In other variations of the ritual, the demons chase
children through the streets to scare them.

In this video from Kumamoto, on the southwestern island of Kyushu, a man
dressed as a namahage enters a home during
[setsubun](https://japanesemythology.wordpress.com/setsubun-the-driving-away-
of-ogres-and-evil-spirits-in-rituals-symbolism-of-beans-and-fish/),
traditionally the day before the start of spring and now observed each year on
February 3.

In some parts of Kumamoto, a namahage visits the household, terrifying the
young children. Part of the _setsubun_ tradition all over Japan involves
children throwing roasted soybeans at a family member wearing an ogre mask,
but in Kumamoto children can throw beans at someone wearing the full ogre
costume from head to toe, appearing to be the “real thing”:

There are [variations on the
tradition](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20181130/k10011729821000.html)
throughout the Japanese archipelago. The island of Miyako, in the far
southwestern reaches of Japan, performs the [_Paantu_
ritual](https://soranews24.com/2014/09/30/miyako-jimas-paantu-festival-
traumatizing-small-children-to-bring-them-good-luck/). The local men who play
the role of visiting gods wear crude masks and cover their bodies with mud and
vines, and then lurch around towns smearing mud on people for good health and
fortune for the next twelve months.

The ritual, of course, frightens the wits out of local children:

Other traditional rituals included in the UNESCO visiting deity listing
include the [Akusekijima God Boze
Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR6LM8OBxfU), [Kagoshima's _mendon_
ritual](https://youtu.be/QW8YBaOpF3U), and the _don-don_ ritual observed in
the [Koshikijima islands](https://goo.gl/maps/Xz36zgAjeEQ2) off the coast of
southwestern Japan, where a visiting demon or ogre, dressed in leaf fronds,
admonishes a child to behave in the coming year:

Akita Prefecture in northeastern Japan is perhaps most famous for visiting
deity rituals, and there is a
[museum](https://www.namahage.co.jp/namahagekan/english/namahage.php) devoted
to the namahage demons at the base of the [Oga
Peninsula](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/meet-namahage-
japans-straw-caped-demon-like-deity/).

After [failing](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/11/29/national/kid-
scaring-namahage-among-japanese-folk-rituals-approved-unesco-intangible-
cultural-heritage-list/) to get Akita's namahage ritual added to UNESCO
intangible cultural heritage list several years ago, Japan decided to submit
all visiting deity rituals as a single group in 2018 and was successful.

Japan's persistence at listing various cultural assets and practices with
UNESCO has not gone unnoticed by some observers.
