buying baby clothes.

Jana Burceska, who represented Macedonia in the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest,
has given birth to the baby whose existence was announced during the
competition in Kiev.

The theme of the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest was “Celebrate Diversity.” Even
though Burceska didn't make it to the finals, the Macedonian representative
caused a sensation — twice.

The first was her introductory video, [in which she revealed that she was
pregnant](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3540397/eurovision-2017-hopeful-
jana-burceska-announces-pregnancy-live-in-semi-final-before-taking-to-the-
stage-for-energetic-performance/) with shots showing her receiving an
ultrasound and shopping for baby clothes.

The move by then-unmarried Burceska incited controversy in her home country.
Macedonian society has backslid from a fairly liberal to quite patriarchal
place in the last decades, due to the influence of right-wing populism.

The second surprise came in the Eurovision Green Room, when performers are
offered a chance to comment while waiting for the results of their
performance. Burceska's boyfriend used the occasion to [propose marriage to

marriage-proposal-Eurovision-hopeful-Jana-Bur-eska.html)

Although Burcevska didn't receive enough votes to move on to the finals, she
seemingly garnered more attention by international media than any other
previous Macedonian contestant. At home, some accused the pregnancy reveal and
public marriage proposal of being a publicity stunt.

Unlike many of the Macedonian representatives in the past, her song “Dance
Alone” received positive reviews from most domestic music critics, who praised
its composition, her performance and the music video. It now plays on regular
rotation in local radio stations.

Following the song contest, Burceska married in August, and took part in a
UNICEF campaign, “Childhood Without Obstacles,” in September.

Her baby girl, named Dona, was born on October 11. The news spread via social
media after Burceska's father announced on his Facebook profile that he had
become a grandfather. Congratulations poured in:

And some used the occasion to comment on larger issues, such as [media
campaigns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqq8xjDVR9Q) by the populist
government that ruled Macedonia from August 2006 to May 2017, which were
supposed to incite “patriotic feelings” among the populace.
