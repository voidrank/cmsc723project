Politicians watching porn, sleeping, or playing games on mobile devices—in
parliament, when the parliament is in session—is a thing in Southeast Asia. In
recent years, several lawmakers across the region have been caught in the act.

Last month, for instance, members of Vietnam's National Assembly were filmed
sleeping while the legislature was in session. Millions of TV viewers tuned in
to watch their now-infamous “sleeping performance.”

Eager to remain awake and avoid the shame of Vietnam's sleepers, lawmakers in
Thailand have turned to looking at pornography during parliamentary debate. A
senator and two members of parliament have been
[spotted](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Democrat-MP-admits-
accidentally-watching-porno-pho-30180248.html) browsing certain X-rated images
on three separate occasions already.

Several of Thailand's major newspapers have taken turns
[castigating](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Bad-behaviour-in-
Parliament-seems-rife-30214685.html) and
[psychoanalyzing](http://asiancorrespondent.com/80830/on-porn-jokes-and-thai-
lawmakers/) the men caught surfing porn on their iPhones.

One of the most common criticisms is that it is enormously hypocritical for
these politicians—men who often pose as moral barometers in public—to look at
pornography at work. In 2011 in Indonesia, for instance, an anti-pornography
crusader from the Islamic Prosperous Justice Party was filmed watching
pornography on a tablet device, forcing him to
[resign](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13032128). (Afterwards,
he vowed to change his ways and study the Koran.)

Less scandalous but possibly just as unprofessional, Southeast Asian lawmakers
have also been caught at work playing games on mobile devices.

90-year-old Philippine Senator Juan Ponce Enrile claims playing Bejeweled
[helps](http://technology.inquirer.net/28003/enrile-admits-playing-bejeweled-

2013, Enrile was famously caught playing the video game, while another senator
denounced him in a fiery speech.

Some members of the Philippine Congress were also caught
[using](http://www.philstar.com/nation/2014/07/30/1351786/sona-2014-whos-
sleeping-whos-texting) their phones during another important speech, when the
country's president delivered the State of the Nation address, earlier this
year.

In today's era of easy surveillance and social media, where anyone has a
camera and a mass media outlet in their pocket, lawmakers will have to learn
some self-restraint, if they want to put an end to these scandals.
