Taiwan’s top court ruled on May 24, 2017 that current regulations prohibiting
marriage between partners of the same sex are unconstitutional.

The constitutional court’s ruling means that the island is set to become the
first Asian country to recognise same-sex marriage.

Announcing the result of a two-month-long constitutional review on Wednesday
afternoon, the panel of 14 judges ordered the legislature to either amend the
Civil Code or introduce new provisions to recognise same-sex marriage within
two years.

The court said that the current regulations are in violation of constitutional
rights to the freedom of marriage and equality among citizens.

Two of the 14 judges dissented, while one refrained from filing an opinion.

Hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters celebrated in Taipei outside the
legislature, in a demonstration held by gay rights group Marriage Equality
Coalition.

“We can finally get married!” shouted demonstrators outside the Legislative
Yuan.

Opponents, however, remain camped outside the judiciary building following
their protest on Tuesday. Anti-gay rights activist Abdulluh Musad has staged
an ongoing hunger strike for four days at Taipei’s Liberty Square.

### **‘I witnessed a history in the making’**

Wednesday’s review was brought to court by two parties, one of which is Chi
Chia-wei, a 59-year-old gay rights activist who first attempted to register a
marriage with his male partner in 1986.

With Taiwan under martial law at the time, he was imprisoned for five months.
The legislature responded to his petition calling homosexuality “a perversion
of a minority.”

Chi was joined in his current petition by the Department of Civil Affairs of
the Taipei government, which earlier said it would respect the court’s ruling
no matter what.

Existing regulations stipulating marriage as a union between a man and a woman
have also been challenged in a bill proposed by legislator Yu Mei-nu of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party. The Legislative Yuan passed the first of
three readings of the bill in December 2016, but a final review is not
expected until later this year.
