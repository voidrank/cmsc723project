Liberian students at the University of Liberia have
[protested](https://frontpageafricaonline.com/front-slider/liberia-pres-weah-
issues-stern-warning-to-ul-prexy-over-hike-in-tuition-source/) a tuition
increase they say they simply can't afford, leading to [low student
enrollment](https://face2faceafrica.com/article/george-weah-declares-public-
universities-in-liberia-tuition-free-after-fee-hike-protest) this semester
with only about 11,000 registered students out of approximately 20,000.

Students were paying $4 United States Dollars per credit hour in 2017 but the
amount increased to $6 USD per credit hour for 2018/2019 school year.

Faced with mounting pressure, newly elected President George Weah surprisingly
declared tuition-free university during a visit to the main campus in late
October 2018. Prince Kurupati

for-liberian-undergraduate-students/)

> Speaking at the University of Liberia, Liberian president George Weah said

[continues](https://www.africanexponent.com/post/9313-weah-announces-
university-of-liberia-and-all-liberian-public-universities-tuition-free):

> During the last campaign before his election, George Weah said to a large

> This is indeed good news and one which will go down well with youth, not

Many students on the main campus celebrated and
[praised](https://frontpageafricaonline.com/uncategorized/liberia-president-
weah-declares-tuition-free-at-all-public-universities/) President Weah's
declaration with singing and dancing, telling reporters that the news came as
an enormous relief.

Abdur Rahman Alfa Shaban
[explains](http://www.africanews.com/2018/10/25/liberia-president-declares-
free-tuition-in-all-public-universities/) that students across all of
Liberia's four public universities had protested against fee hikes in the past
because of incremental increases in the costs of registration and tuition,
causing many to drop out.

> President Weah made University of Liberia tuition free. I‚Äôm going back home

This time, students mainly from the Fendall Student Association (FENSA) staged
a protest before the Offices of the President, led by student Heylove Mark,
who told school officials that the tuition hikes would prevent many students
from matriculation.

President Weah heard the students‚Äô concerns and returned with his surprising
declaration of tuition-free university education.

### **Can Liberia afford** a free-for-all **college education?**

Former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf called Liberia‚Äôs education system [‚Äúa
mess‚Äù](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-liberia-education/liberias-
education-system-a-mess-president-sirleaf-idUSBRE97S0TO20130829) after 25,000
high school students failed state university entrance exams five years ago.
This has led Liberia to enter a nationwide
[experiment](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42413639) with private-public
partnerships to help alleviate strains in the education system caused by civil
war and the Ebola crisis.

Given the burdensome cost of running a state university as a line item on the
national budget, Front Page Africa (FPA) wrote [a
post](https://frontpageafricaonline.com/editorial/good-populist-move-mr-
president-but-did-you-consider-the-ramifications/) wondering if Weah's
populist move is sustainable. According to FPA, Liberia allocates $16,299,877
USD to the University of Liberia per fiscal year, which already presents
enormous challenges. FPA continues:

> A recent World Bank report puts Liberia‚Äôs fiscal deficit at 5.2 percent of
> the GDP in FY 2018. This is a result of a significant shortfall in revenues
> and higher than anticipated non-discretionary expenditures ‚Ä¶ [T]he
> government is facing a hard time with generating finance and the situation
> might just worsen. Therefore, it is important that we face the reality: this
> government cannot afford to underwrite the hefty cost of running a free
> public universities or colleges. Has this government backtracked to assess
> the impact of the free primary and secondary education? Or is it only
> desperate to thrive on the popularity of abysmal policies?

Liberians took to Twitter to express their doubt:

> Not surprised George Weah has fully morphed into the typical African leader;
> no vision, grand gestures of populism, appropriation of state assets &
> platforms for self aggrandizement. Man just declared free tuition for public
> universities in Liberia, a very very poor country. SMH.

The Association of Liberian Journalists in the Americas looked suspiciously at
Weah's decision, [considering](http://www.bushchicken.com/president-weah-
announces-tuition-waiver-at-public-colleges/) it too spontaneous and meant to
garner political support:

> Mr. Weah‚Äôs tuition free announcement sounds plausible, but neither he nor
> the Liberian government has the monetary and logistical supports for the
> realization of the policy. ALJA wondered how the President and the CDC
> administration will fund such an undertaking after January 22, 2018, while
> delivering his first legislative agenda to the 54th National Legislature of
> Liberia, he declared publicly that the Liberian economy is broken and by
> extension the government.

Since Weah was elected, Liberia has seen a rapid depreciation of currency
against the US dollar. The UN officially closed its peace-keeping mission in
war-torn Liberia in March 2018, and began withdrawing [nearly
15,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-liberia-peacekeepers/u-n-closes-up-
liberia-peacekeeping-mission-after-15-years-idUSKBN1GY2FX) troops in mid-2016,
creating a huge blow to the Liberian economy.

The ‚ÄúLiberian dollar had declined 25 percent over 2017 and a further 25
percent since January‚Äù, [lamented](https://netbuzzafrica.com/president-george-
weah-takes-on-inflation-and-foreign-currency-shortages/) Weah who [was
elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Weah) on December 26, 2017.

George Weah is the only African player to win the competitive football award
[Ballon d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d%27Or "Ballon d'Or") and
picked up the nickname King George after ending his football career [at
40.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inspirational-george-weah-high-school-
diploma-age-40-today-durosawo) Realizing the value of higher education, he
pursued a degree at Devry University in Miami, Florida, to study business
administration and criminal justice which he completed in 2013 at the age of
47.

Weah would hope this move could be enough to angry appease students, but they
responded to Weah's announcement with [further
demands](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20181110071736610).
Other students worry the move will silence political voices on campus,
reducing the power student organizations once earned through the securement of
student scholarships.
