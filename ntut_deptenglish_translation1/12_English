In early September, when a Cairo Criminal Court
[handed](https://globalvoices.org/2018/09/09/egyptian-photojournalist-mahmoud-
shawkan-to-be-released-soon-after-five-years-in-prison/) a five-year jail
sentence to photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, his supporters were relieved.

Mahmoud Abu Zeid, known online as Shawkan, was unlawfully detained and tried
for photographing the 2013 bloody dispersal of the Rabaa El Adaweya sit-in,
during which Egyptian security forces [killed at least 817
people](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/08/12/all-according-plan/raba-
massacre-and-mass-killings-protesters-egypt) and injured many more. Shawkan
was working for Demotix at the time.

As the 31-year-old freelancer had already spent five years in jail awaiting
trial, there was hope that he would not be made to serve additional time. Yet
today, more than one month after the Cairo court verdict, Shawkan remains in
jail.

Shawkan was tried along with 739 other defendants in what is known as the
“Rabaa Dispersal Case”. He was arrested on August 14, 2013 as he was covering
the sit-in, in which supporters of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi
gathered to protest a military coup that ended his presidency on July 3 that
same year. Shawkan
[spent](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/06/egypt-verdicts-
expected-for-739-defendants-in-grotesque-mass-death-penalty-trial/) almost
four years in pre-trial detention, in violation of Egyptian law which sets the
maximum limit to two years.

On September 8, 2018, he was [convicted](https://cpj.org/2018/09/egypt-
sentences-photojournalist-shawkan-to-five-ye.php) on spurious charges of
murder and affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, now designated as a
terrorist group by the Egyptian government.

During the same trial, 75 prominent members and affiliates of the Muslim
Brotherhood were
[sentenced](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/egypt-
sentences-75-to-death-in-rabaa-massacre-mass-trial) to death, and 47 other
defendants were [sentenced](https://ciluna27.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/freedom-
for-shawkan-at-last/) to life in prison.

Despite hopes that he was going to be freed soon, Shawkan's ordeal is yet to
come to an end, and there has been no public explanation as to why Shawkan
remains in jail to this date. His supporters continue to demand his release.

In a [statement](https://www.anhri.info/?p=1532&lang=en) released on October
11, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), called on
Egyptian authorities to free Shawkan and denounced the trial's irregularities:

> The first blow came when officials, officers, and soldiers had been excluded
> in the indictment or the formal statement of accusations, despite the
> hundreds of victims who fell on 14 August 2013, the day the sit-in was
> dispersed. The second blow is that hundreds of defendants had already
> exceeded the maximum period of pretrial detention by law. And finally, those
> who already served their full sentences are being deprived of the right to
> be released, in a blatant disregard of the judiciary decisions.

Shawkan's ordeal is similar to many others languishing in Egyptian prisoners.
Those arrested on politically-motivated charges in Egypt are
[subjected](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/egypt) to numerous
violations including arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture,
prolonged pre-trial detention and [solitary
confinement](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/egypt-the-use-of-
indefinite-solitary-confinement-against-prisoners-amounts-to-torture/).

On October 10, for the sixth year in a row, Shawkan
[celebrated](https://katib.net/2018/10/10/شوكان-يطفئ-شمعة-عيد-ميلاده-السادسة-
في-ا/?fbclid=IwAR0gNdE5y7STra0iOI7pP9uPCuTHwVkIVrIibvQmGM_LXOVS4yeRw-Lv2Sw)
his birthday in prison, when he turned 31. How many more birthdays will he
have to celebrate behind bars?
