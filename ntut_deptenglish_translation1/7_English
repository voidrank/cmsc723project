[Papuan Voices](https://papuanvoices.net/2018/08/09/ffpii.html), a video
advocacy organization, has organized two independent film festivals since 2017
to celebrate the lives and struggles of indigenous Papuans in the southeastern
province of Indonesia.

In 2015, _Global Voices_ first
[featured](https://globalvoices.org/2015/02/20/video-project-documents-the-
life-and-struggles-of-west-papuans/) Papuan Voices as a project with
EngageMedia, and during the same year, Papuan Voices established itself as an
independent organization with a presence now in six Papuan regions.

As the country’s most resource-rich but cash-poor area, a recent influx of
Indonesians from other regions has
[displaced](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/02/03/west-papuans-clamor-for-
justice-after-indonesian-police-kill-young-protesters/) many indigenous
Papuans. Some Papuans decry it as an illegal occupation and demand their
[independence](http://freewestpapua.org/info/history-of-west-papua/) from
Indonesia.

Within this context, as the first film festival held in Papua, it[
aimed:](https://papuanvoices.net/2017/06/05/festival-film-papua.html)

> to [highlight](https://papuanvoices.net/2018/07/24/19-films-submitted-for-
> the-papuan-film-festival-2018.html) the issues of the indigenous people of

> important issues impacting them.

Nearly 30 films were submitted, 50 people participated in the pre-festival
production workshops, and 10 films were produced through youth-focused
workshops.

Inspired by its inaugural success, the organization
[held](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=RciQkTSBUw8) a second
film festival last August 2018 with over 1,000 audience members. A total of 19
films from different areas in Papua were

Mecky Yeimo, a film festival participant,
[said](https://papuanvoices.net/2018/08/17/ffpiireport.html) that the films
provided a lot of information about the land disputes between indigenous
Papuan landowners and investors acquiring local lands for mining and palm
plantations.

Franky Samperante, the director of Pusaka, an indigenous Indonesian non-
governmental organization,
[noted](http://tabloidjubi.com/artikel-18375-festival-film-papua-salurkan-
suara-kaum-tak-
bersuara.html?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=socialnetwork)
the importance of the film festival:

> In Papua, there are very limited options to obtain information by ordinary
> people because information is controlled by certain dominant groups. The
> information in these films will be very useful for many people at the local,
> national and international levels.

Many of the films featured during both festivals depict the everyday struggles
of Papuans.

For example, the 2017 Best Film award winner [‘Monce
Truck’](https://papuanvoices.net/2018/04/10/truk-monce.html) is a documentary
directed by Imanuel Hindom about a former truck driver for a [palm
oil](https://globalvoices.org/2015/02/26/how-did-palm-oil-become-such-a-
problem-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/) plantation in Keerom Regency who found a
way to help Papuan women sellers (“Mama-mama” in Papuan) find a new source of
income by transporting their vegetables to new markets in the capital city of
Jayapura:

[‘The Caretaker of Isio Hill Forest’](https://papuanvoices.net/2018/04/06/the-
caretaker-of-isio-hill-forest.html) is another inspiring short documentary
which narrates the story of Alex Waisimon who turned a lush forest in Papua
into a famous bird-watching spot for tourists. The film was directed by Asrida
Elisabeth, Harun Rumbarar, Bernad Koten, Yosef Levi.

Since 2011, both Papuan Voices and EngageMedia have trained more than 50
filmmakers and produced approximately 100 films which were screened in more
than 50 locations in and out of Indonesia.
