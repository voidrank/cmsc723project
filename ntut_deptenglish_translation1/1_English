As Japan predicts a rise in the number of immigrants and foreign tourists in
the coming years, a new television show has turned migrant deportations into
entertainment. The program provoked some [outraged viewer
reactions](https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%81%AE%E7%9E%AC%E9%96%93&src=tyah)
and insights about the plight faced by visa overstayers and undocumented
migrants in Japan.

_Taikyo no Shunkan_ (タイキョの瞬間) (English translation: “At the Very Moment They
Were Deported”) premiered on [Fuji
Television](https://www.fujitv.co.jp/fujitv/news/pub_2018/181005-i380.html) in
a Saturday evening prime time slot on October 6, 2018.

Using a typical reality show format, the two-hour program follows a group of
so-called “G-Men”, or immigration officers, employed by the Tokyo regional
office of the National Immigration Bureau as they hunt down visa overstayers
and so-called “illegal aliens” ( _fuhotaizaisha_ , 不法滞在者) and squatters (
_fuhosenshu_ , 不法占有) on camera.

In one segment, the immigration officers stake out the apartment of a
Vietnamese man suspected of violating the conditions of his [trainee
visa](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/11/01/national/new-rules-japan-
looks-wipe-abuse-trainee-system-critics-say-must-done/). He and two others are
arrested and interrogated on camera before being deported 24 hours later.

In another segment, the immigration officers storm a factory and detain a
group of Indians suspected of being undocumented workers — the owners of the
factory never appear on camera.

A final segment investigates the problem of Chinese “squatters” who have set
up a vegetable patch on public land on an isolated stretch of riverbank in
Kyoto.

For now, a fan upload of the
[video](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6uy57a) of the entire program can
be viewed on DailyMotion.

The content and tone of _Taikyo no Shunkan_ was [widely
criticized](https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%81%AE%E7%9E%AC%E9%96%93&src=typd),
with Japanese anti-racism group Counter-Racist Action Collective (C.R.A.C.)
noting that Japan's Immigration Bureau, which employs the featured “G-Men”,
actively promoted the program:

The television program appears as [Japan plans to beef
up](http://www.debito.org/?p=15129) its immigration services — the government
seeks to recruit at least [500,000 foreign
workers](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/05/2f6e0d37f0be-japan-to-
welcome-500000-foreign-workers-to-help-plug-labor-shortage.html) to help deal
with a perceived labor shortage (Japanese women still participate
[less](http://www.geopolitika.hu/en/2018/02/13/womenomics-women-at-the-
japanese-labour-market/) in the labor market, leading to worker shortages).

Many of the potential 500,000 foreign workers are expected to work as
[temporary labor](http://www.debito.org/?p=15107) with low wages and
precarious employment, providing plenty of incentives for workers to seek
better-paying but undocumented work once they arrive.

A Buzzfeed Japan [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/kotahatachi/immi-moj3)
by Kota Hatachi about _Taikyo No Shunkan_ collected online comments about the
program and insights about the life of foreign workers in Japan. One noted
that while the undocumented workers were presented as a threat to Japan, in
reality, it's the workers themselves who are stalked, interrogated and
subsequently deported, clearly facing the most risk.

Hatachi points out that at least 13 people have
[died](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/kotahatachi/immi-moj3) in immigration
detention in Japan since 2009, a statistic that was never acknowledged by the
_Taikyo No Shunkan_ program.

Mogi Kenichiro, a media personality and neuroscientist, also criticized the
vapidity of a television program that treated immigration raids as
entertainment:

>
> フジテレビ「タイキョの瞬間」は、今の日本の地上波テレビの、何事も深く考えず、批判的思考のかけらもなく、表面的なちゃらちゃらしたエンタメにしてしまうという愚劣さが、最悪のかたちで表れた番組だと思います。国際的な恥です。

> こんな地上波テレビなんて、一秒たりとも見なくていい。

> With no deep insights, without even a shred of critical analysis and the
> stupidity of superficial entertainment, Fuji TV's _Taikyo no Shunkan_ is the
> worst television program on Japanese television today. It's an international

Following the program's broadcast, Japanese activists mobilized to let
apprehended undocumented workers incarcerated in a regional detention center
and others know that they are not alone:

Television programs that exploit immigration enforcement as entertainment with
the support and help of government border security agencies are not limited to
Japan.

Media in the [United
Kingdom](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1020845/Home-Office-
funds-Sky-propaganda-400-000-taxpayers-money.html) and
[Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security:_Australia%27s_Front_Line)
have long broadcast programs in which travelers and undocumented migrants are
ambushed, interrogated, detained and sometimes deported on camera.

A similar [Canadian
program](https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2016/06/12/border-
security-tv-show-cancelled-after-watchdog-finds-privacy-violation.html),
produced with the direct cooperation of the Canada Border Services Agency
(CBSA), was canceled in 2016 due to personal privacy violations. The program
is still broadcast in [reruns](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/border-
security-tv-cbsa-1.4805680).
