A new [state-run
platform](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/29/c_137428781.htm) is now
centralizing efforts to stop online “rumors” in China.

This is a significant step for China, where [any piece of
information](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2013/09/05/hundreds-arrested-for-
spreading-rumors-on-chinas-ideological-battlefield/) that does not come from
official government channels can be considered a rumor.

Since 2012, Chinese authorities have undertaken a series of measures and
campaigns to control online speech. Major social media platforms have been
forced to implement community rules and reporting systems intended to curb the
spread of rumors and false information.

In September 2013, an official “[rumor
rule](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/china-social-media-jail-
rumours)” was issued, under which high-profile internet users could face up to
seven years in prison for posting unverified information, if it were viewed
5,000 times or shared more than 500 times.

According to a [2017 rumor governance
report](http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2017-12-20/doc-ifypwzxq4631964.shtml)
from WeChat, China's popular social media and chat site, the platform blocked
more than 500 million messages deemed to be rumors in 2017, and penalized more
than 180,000 WeChat public accounts for spreading rumors.

In July 2018, state internet regulators received [6.7 million
reports](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/poliitics/article/2162036/china-
launches-piyao-platform-crack-down-online-rumours) of illegal and false
information.

But it seems authorities felt these efforts were still inadequate. So on
August 29, 2018, they launched [Piyao](http://www.piyao.org.cn/), an official
platform that integrates existing initiatives for cracking down on “rumors”
and upholding “truth” on the internet.

Piyao, meaning “rumor-squashing”, is hosted by the Central Cyberspace Affairs
Commission and operated by the official Xinhua news. The platform, which
includes a website and mobile app, has integrated data from 40 other rumor
report platforms and generated a rumor database with 30,000 incidents. It
encourages the public to file reports, but also uses artificial intelligence
to identify rumors spreading online.

Upon collecting and analyzing the “rumor” data, reports are disseminated
through the platform’s website and mobile apps, as well as its WeChat and
Weibo account. Censorship authorities also issue instructions to social media
sites to block the relevant information.

The platform has various sections, including official releases from government
bureaus, instant response from local governments, media fact checking, expert
analysis and resources for stopping rumors.

According to [Xinhua’s
report](https://www.weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404278488021520826&sudaref=s.weibo.com),
the platform is a joint effort of 27 government departments, including the
Central Party School, and is working with more than one hundred media experts.

On Weibo, which is heavily censored, the majority of the comments about Piyao
echoed the messages of authorities. Below is a typical message of
[praise](http://weibo.com/3288875501/Gx4k45Jig):

>
> 俗话说，“三人成虎”。我们的生活经常遭遇各种谣言，诸如“紫菜是塑料袋做的”、这些谣言侵犯个人隐私，制造社会恐慌，有的谣言借助网络实现病毒式传播，向网络谣言亮剑已经刻不容缓！

> There is a saying that when three people said that there was a tiger in the
> market, everyone took them seriously. We always encounter rumors in our
> daily life, such as the seaweed was made of plastic, etc. Rumors have
> infringed on individual privacy and created social panic. Some rumors have
> become viral online and we have to point our sword to crackdown online
> rumors.

But Radio Free Asia pointed out that the very definition of “rumor” in China
quite often refers to politically sensitive information that is proven to be
true. A Mr. Yuan [points
out](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/meiti/hj-08302018105411.html):

>
> 从中国的现实情况来看，政府严加打击的一部分谣言通常是“遥遥领先”的“预言”…像薄熙来事件、周永康事件。当时传言北京政变。还有令计划儿子（令谷）车祸死亡的事情。

> In China, some of the so-called “rumors” are “predictions” of the reality
> [that has not been reported by official media outlets]… Like the [Bo
> Xilai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Xilai) incident, the [Zhou

> the official reports] there are rumors about a coup. Also the car accident
> of the son of [Ling Jihua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ling_Jihua) [the
> news was spread on the internet].

Yuan believes that the new platform is to strengthen stability control:

>
> 一个是中共高层斗争比较激烈，政治八卦特别多。政府可能想从这方面引导一下。再一个社会矛盾激化，各种事情层出不穷。好像最近昆山砍人、老兵群体维权、还有P2P暴雷。这些维权事件特别多。（当局）有点控制不住，就想引导舆论。

Since there are already a few dozen rumor-squashing platforms in operation and
most Chinese netizens already avoid making critical comments and sharing
politically sensitive information online, many have cast doubt on the
effectiveness of the integrated platform.

Some are taking the news as a joke, like @guobaoj from Twitter:

>
> 中共集团真是奇葩集团，他们又鼓捣出一个互联网联合辟谣平台，真让人类笑掉大牙。中共几十年天天一本正经的造谣传谣，什么亩产万斤超英赶美伟光正，把所有中国人蒙的一愣一愣的都深信不疑，怎么又出来个联合辟谣的东西？互联网你们控制了，民众被你们割喉了，老百姓早说不出话来了，你们辟的哪家子谣？
