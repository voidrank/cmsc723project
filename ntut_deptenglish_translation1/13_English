The Singapore government [ordered](http://singapore.coconuts.co/2016/06/13/no-
more-same-sex-kiss-singapore-staging-les-miserables-after-public-complaints)
the removal of a brief kissing scene between two men in a production of “Les
Misérables” after it says it received some complaints from the public.

[Les Misérables](https://www.facebook.com/LesMisSg) is a musical based on the
French historical novel written by Victor Hugo in 1862. It is one of the
longest-running musicals in the world.

During a wedding scene near the end of the show, a villain mocks the guests
and kisses a male character who introduces himself as a “queer.” The kiss was
supposed to be performed while the song “Beggars at the Feast” played.

Apparently, the kiss offended some viewers, who reported it to the
authorities, arguing that the kiss was not part of the script in the original
production.

Responding to the complaint, the government’s Media Development Authority
(MDA) ordered the organizer to cut the kissing scene. Below is an
[excerpt](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/same-sex-kiss-cut-from-
singapore-staging-of-les-miserables) of the agency’s statement:

> Under our classification code, such a scene would fall under an “Advisory”
> rating. The applicant decided to remove the scene so as to keep the
> “General” rating for the rest of its run. MDA will take action against this
> breach of licensing conditions.

The musical's organizers complied, replacing the kiss with a long hug, though
they [insist](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/les-miserables-in-singapore-mda-to-
take-action-122206932.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw)—in an apparent effort
to downplay the scene's homoeroticism—that the kissing was meant to be comic.

The show opened on May 31, and the kissing scene was removed on June 3.

The MDA's action [infuriated](http://lohandbehold.com/2016/06/15/that-
miserable-kiss/) many Singaporeans, especially the LGBT community, who felt
that it was unnecessary.

The issue highlighted the dominance of conservative values in Singapore's
bureaucracy. Despite the existence of a vibrant LGBT community in the country,
discrimination continues to be a serious problem. In fact, Singapore
[outlaws](https://globalvoices.org/2015/03/08/singapore-blogger-who-

The complaint against the same-sex kiss scene was posted on the Facebook page
[“We Are Against Pinkdot in
Singapore,”](https://www.facebook.com/groups/waapd/permalink/1035479086488888/?__mref=message_bubble)
which refers to the country's annual [“Pink Dot” LGBT
celebration](https://globalvoices.org/2015/06/16/pink-dot-rally-for-lgbt-
rights-gathers-28000-people-in-singapore/).

teo/that-same-sex-kiss-in-les-mis%C3%A9rables-did-audience-goers-really-just-
watch-the-pl/10154477666326992) the people who complained about the kissing
scene to focus on the musical's other themes:

> …for the complainants to zoom in on this kiss, which was a truly minor
> illustrative point inconsequential to the broader themes of the play, is
> really missing the forest for the trees. They could stand to learn a lesson

Playwright Alfian Sa'at, meanwhile, said he is
[saddened](https://www.facebook.com/alfiansaat/posts/10153563036962371) by the
MDA's decision:

> You might think that canceling the kiss represents some kind of victory over
> LGBT’s and liberals, but honestly, it is nothing more than a triumph of
> ignorance and hysteria over common sense and sober reflection.
