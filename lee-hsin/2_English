What happens to your Facebook data — your identity information, photos, links
and “likes” — when you share it outside of the US? Plenty. Your data will flow
from your computer, to the nearest servers of the company, and eventually land
at Facebook's home servers in California, where it will likely be mined by
Facebook for commercial gain and subject to snooping by the NSA.

What laws protect your information along the way? Not many. But a recent court
ruling should change this for European Internet users.

Until this month, a “Safe Harbor” [regulatory
policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles)
agreement between the US and EU allowed companies like Facebook and Google to
self-regulate the transfer of data between Europe and the US. It is now
formally [dead](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-
down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/). Unilaterally approved by
the European Commission in 2000, the policy allowed companies to promise that
they would abide by EU privacy laws when handling the data of EU persons,
without needing to provide explicit proof of their compliance. Among other
things, it required companies to notify users of the collection and use of
their data, allow them to opt out of its collection or transfer, and keep it
secure.

Since the Snowden revelations, it has become increasingly difficult to believe
that US companies uphold EU privacy standards when processing EU user data.

The policy was unexpectedly killed on October 6 by the [European Court of
Justice](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/) which ruled that the
United States’ mass surveillance regime makes it impossible for companies to
abide by the policy in full. The Snowden leaks revealed the degree to which US
technology companies bend to the demands of government, and indicated to the
EU court that US companies therefore could not guarantee the same privacy
protections as their European competitors.

The case began in 2013, when Austrian privacy activist Maxmilian Schrems
[filed a lawsuit in Ireland](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-
court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/) (home of
Facebook's EU headquarters), in the wake of the [Snowden
revelations.](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2013-special-
coverage/snowden-the-us-is-watching-you/) Schrems challenged Ireland's Data
Protection Commissioner to investigate Facebook's compliance with European
data privacy laws, as it had pledged to do under the Safe Harbor agreement.
When the Commissioner refused, Schrems took them to court.

The Court of Justice’s top legal adviser, Yves Bot, [wrote
that](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-09/cp150106en.pdf)
“Interference with fundamental rights is contrary to the principle of
proportionality, in particular because the surveillance carried out by the
United States intelligence services is mass, indiscriminate surveillance.” In
an initial response, [Schrems wrote](http://www.europe-v-
facebook.org/CJEU_IR.pdf):

> This decision is a major blow for US global surveillance that heavily relies
> on private partners. The judgement makes it clear that US businesses cannot
> simply aid US espionage efforts in violation of European fundamental rights.

### **Big or small step for Europeans’ right to privacy?**

[Experts](https://www.lawfareblog.com/surveillance-reform-only-hope-reviving-
safe-harbor) as well as tech
[observers](http://lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/10/09/donnees-personnelles-
la-seule-solution-est-que-les-etats-unis-acceptent-de-modifier-leur-
legislation-nationale_4786529_4408996.html?) in the media were quick to offer
analysis and recommendations with many arguing that the decision should serve
as a wakeup call to the United States to reform its surveillance law.

While French data privacy government watchdog [National Commission on
Informatics and Liberty](http://National Commission on Informatics and
Liberty) (CNIL) [welcomed](http://www.liberation.fr/direct/element/safe-
harbor-la-cnil-salue-une-decision-cle-pour-la-protection-des-donnees_19814/)
it as a “key decision for data protection,” many privacy rights defenders
celebrated the decision. French digital rights group [La Quadrature du
Net](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/safe-harbor-repealed-cjue) wrote:

Human rights lawyer Renata Avila, who serves as campaign lead for the Web We
Want initiative, [joined LQDN](http://webfoundation.org/2015/10/privacy-
before-profit-european-court-of-justice-rules-safe-harbor-is-invalid/) in
celebrating the victory: “That Max Schrems, a 28 year old law student, could
successfully challenge a long-standing international agreement underlines why
we must preserve the Web as a space for debate, dissent and progress,” she
said in a press statement.

Experts say US surveillance agencies should be
[unfazed](http://www.frenchweb.fr/4-reactions-suite-a-la-suspension-du-safe-
harbor/208938) by the ruling, but that it will have significant implications
for companies whose business model depends on mass data transfers:

Some users saw the Court's decision as a long-deserved blow to the infamous
“GAFA”, the US giants of the Internet Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple:

US-based tech blog [TechCrunch
speculated](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-
safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/) that the shift may prompt more
companies to begin using strong encryption technology that would allow them to
comply with (and exceed) European requirements. While it may seem most painful
for the GAFAs of the world, these companies have substantial resources that
they can put toward implementing such changes. In contrast, many critics
pointed out that small companies may stand to lose the most from the ruling,
as they have fewer resources to address the types of operational changes that
a new policy will likely require.

European data protection authorities have given national governments and the
European Commission [three
months](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2994815/privacy-watchdogs-give-eu-us-
three-months-to-negotiate-new-safe-harbor-deal.html) to determine what
mechanisms will replace the Safe Harbor system. And open Internet advocates in
the EU are ready for the next round. La Quadrature du Net
[states](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/safe-harbor-repealed-cjue):

> We ask all French and European representatives to draw the necessary
> conclusions and work towards protection of citizens within the EU,
> especially by invalidating monitoring laws currently under consideration in
