Videos coming out of Lebanon show protesters being attacked viciously by
security forces using teargas and water cannons, shot directly at the crowds.

The Tol3et Re7atkom (You Stink) movement gathered thousands of people last
weekend in Beirut to demonstrate for a sustainable solution to the country's
piling rubbish. But protesters were met with police violence in some cases,
despite the movement's declarations that it is
[adhering](http://hummusforthought.com/2015/08/21/the-what-why-and-how-of-
saturday-the-22nds-protest/) to Non-Violent Direct Action (NVDA).

Here are some videos which show examples of police violence against civilians.

After chanting “This is a peaceful protests” civilians were beaten up by
police forces:

Lebanese blogger Joey Ayoub, who is also a Global Voices Online Lebanon
author, provides a first-hand account of what happened on August 22 and how
the situation escalated on his blog Hummus for Thought. Ayoub
[explains](http://hummusforthought.com/2015/08/23/what-happened-on-saturday-
the-22nd-of-august/):

> I was there alongside thousands of Lebanese citizens demanding for our
> rights when we were met with police brutality, teargas canisters, water-
> canons and armed thugs following peaceful protestors and beating them.
>
> […]
>
> As one of those who helped organize this protest, I can safely tell you that
> the government’s reaction was beyond anything we were expecting. We were
> expecting water-cannons like last time, and many of us came prepared for
> those (putting our phones in plastic bags etc.). But we were not prepared
> for the teargas and we were certainly not expecting to see riot police and
> army men playing the role of government thugs.
>
> […]
>
> The sheer savagery of riot police and army men shooting teargas canisters
> haphazardly at any concentration of people they saw in front of us was a
> shock to us all. We saw old women and children between carried by men to
> save them from getting crushed by everyone else. We were yelling ‘we have
> kids! We have kids!’ while riot police increased the velocity of the water
> cannons until none of us could stand on our feet. The water-cannons pushed
> nearly 10,000 people into one another on a narrow street. Kids who came with
> their parents were being trampled on, old ladies screaming ‘shame! shame!’
> while they tried to run away, young men and women building a solidarity wall
> to prevent the brutality of water cannons from hitting the weaker ones among
> us.

Ayoub wonders:

> It was extremely dangerous. We genuinely feared for our lives. And for what?
> Demanding sustainable solutions to Lebanon’s trash crisis as opposed to its
> current catastrophic mismanagement? Wanting to live normal lives free of
> such suffocating corruption and sectarian nepotism?

You Stink has broadened its focus beyond officials’ mishandling of the refuse
problem following the closure of the country's largest landfill in July.
Members are now calling for the government's resignation, an end to corruption
and fresh parliamentary elections, among other demands. Lebanon, already
suffering from a poor infrastructure and daily electricity cuts, has had no
president for over a year. In 2009, its parliament extended its term until
2017, with no elections, citing instability as a reason.
