As a platform, Uber has provided an alternative to the car-riding public in
many countries, but it has also earned the ire of taxi drivers and other
public transport operators who feel threatened by it. Some of those who
believe that Uber is hurting the local economy have even organized protests
across the world. Recently, protests against Uber were launched in both
Portugal and Indonesia.

## **Protests in 3 cities of Portugal**

Taxi drivers from the three main Portuguese cities—Faro, Lisbon, and
Porto—gathered together for a massive rally against Uber. Thousands of taxi
drivers took to the streets to express their concern about the company's work.

> About 3,500 taxi drivers protested against Uber in Lisbon, Porto, and Faro

The drivers’ main grievance is that Uber has no license to operate as a
passenger transportation business in Portugal, yet it continues to offer its
service to the public. Many taxi drivers say they felt tricked when they lost
customers to Uber. Thus, they decided to hold a protest.

The protest, however, got the attention of the international media for an
entirely wrong reason. News about the mass rally trended because of a violent
incident featuring taxi drivers and a photojournalist who was also caught in
the middle of the confusion and ended up in the hospital after being bashed by
infuriated taxi drivers. The organizers of the Taxi Drivers’ Protest against
Uber said they deeply regretted the incident with the journalist.

In the end, it seems the protests are only making Uber more popular: its
Portuguese app recently became the most downloaded app in the country.

The protest activity also made some Portuguese citizens want to know more
about the Uber service, and many were tempted to try it:

Before this massive protest, Uber was prohibited from operating in Portugal as
[ordered](http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/uber-proibida-de-operar-em-
portugal-1693930) by a court in Lisbon. However, the company has continued to
run its business, according to its
[website](https://www.uber.com/cities/lisbon).

Reacting to the court decision banning the service, a group of citizens
launched an [online petition](http://peticaopublica.com/pview.aspx?pi=PT76967)
requesting that Uber be allowed to operate in the country.

Three days before the taxi drivers’ demonstration, the Portuguese government
[asked](http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/Buzz/interior.aspx?content_id=4762313) the
European Union and the European Parliament for help in regulating the company.
The main issue Portuguese officials want to settle is whether Uber is an
online service delivery platform or a passenger transportation company.

In the meantime, tourists are the ones who suffer most. Getting an Uber
service at the Lisbon airport has become dangerous since Portuguese taxi
drivers are now patrolling the area to drive away Uber cars.

## **Protest Against Uber in Indonesia**

Some cities in Indonesia have also recently seen protests against Uber. As in
Portugal, taxi drivers in Bandung and Jakarta in Indonesia feel that Uber is
undermining their livelihood.

But Uber has proven popular among the public who noticed that regular taxis
usually charge higher rates. “The consumer now has more choices and then gets
more benefit,” said Ficky, one of the Uber riders in Indonesia.

Furthermore, passengers seem to appreciate that Uber cars are usually bigger
and more comfortable.

A few months after Uber was launched in Indonesia, some licensed taxi
operators filed a police
[complaint](http://juaranews.com/index.php?/berita/5045/23/06/2015/pengusaha-
taksi-di-bandung-protes-taksi-uber) in Jakarta and Bandung. The petitioners
claimed that Uber prices were low because the company wasn't paying the right
amount of taxes to the government.

There were a total of 9 taxi companies that joined the protest and filed the
report to the police. In Bandung and Jakarta, the local governments ruled that
Uber was illegally operating as a public transport service. Then, a joint task
force was formed among the local governments, district police, and Ministry of
Transportation to halt the operations of Uber as a taxi service. Ipung Purnomo
of Jakarta Police
[said](http://nasional.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/hukum/15/09/12/nuju0n361-satuan-
pemburu-taksi-uber-dibentuk):

> In order to protect the safety of the people, we decided to forbid Uber in
> some cities. This decision is based on the rule that forbids using private
> cars as a means of public transportation.

The protests in both Portugal and Indonesia show that in many countries,
online platforms like Uber, though offering cheaper rides and more
convenience, face both the displeasure of local taxi drivers and regulatory
challenges. The regulation of services like Uber can directly affect local
businesses and ordinary citizens.
