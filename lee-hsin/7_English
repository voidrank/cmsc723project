US President Barack Obama made history this week by becoming the first sitting
president to visit Ethiopia and to [deliver a
speech](http://www.voanews.com/content/obama-african-union-
headquarters/2881128.html) before the African Union.

Obama's plan to visit Ethiopia [was
rebuked](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/06/23/an-official-white-house-
visit-to-ethiopia-africans-tell-obama-dont-do-it/) by human right advocates
who argued that it would award undue praise to the Ethiopian government, which
has pursued a crackdown on local media workers resulting in dozens of
detentions and multi-year prison sentences, including the jailing of six
members of the Global Voices community. The ruling party also secured 100% of
parliamentary seats in the May 2015 elections, leaving Ethiopians suspicious
that authorities had interfered with electoral systems.

The tone of the disappointment and anger began to ease after [the release of
several bloggers and
journalists](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/07/13/ethiopians-react-to-
bloggers-release-with-compassion-criticism/) prior to the arrival of President
Obama.

During his visit, President Obama and PM Desalegn were joined for a state
dinner by prominent Ethiopian figures including artists, sportsmen and
politicians. However, the leader of the Ethiopian Blue Party Yilikal Getnet
[turned down an invitation](http://www.ethiomedia.com/102shows/6223.htm) to
the dinner, [saying](http://www.ethiomedia.com/102shows/6223.html) “it would
amount to taking part in a luxurious dinner while millions suffer in
Ethiopia.”

Displeased with President Obama's support for the Ethiopian government, Jawar
Mohammed, a prominent advocate in Ethiopia-Oromo affairs, [wrote on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Jawarmd/posts/10101802312932233?pnref=story):

Reacting to his Jawar's assessment, Amin Kedir
[advised](https://www.facebook.com/Jawarmd/posts/10101802312932233?comment_id=10101802441968643&offset=0&total_comments=85&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D):

Kedir Tibeso [did not expect
much](https://www.facebook.com/Jawarmd/posts/10101802312932233?comment_id=10101802472402653&offset=0&total_comments=85&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
from Obama either:

The problem is not Obama but the lack of a united opposition movement based on
ideology rather than tribe, [noted

Many commenters on the visit concurred that Ethiopians should not wait for the
US to build a democratic government in their country. They control their own
destiny,[

During Obama's address to the African Union, Adam [took
note](https://www.facebook.com/ababekir/posts/849360368490057) of Obama's
support for presidential term limits:

> Great speech Mr President. I hope that The African Union council must adopt
