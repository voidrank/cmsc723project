Aye Chan Myae about the relationship between

**Aye Chan Myae:** This year marks the centenary of the introduction of
cartoons into Myanmar. Cartoonists have gone through various experiences in
that time. U Win Aung (U is a term of respect used to address men in a senior
position or rank in Myanmar), what is your view on the experiences of
cartoonists in political, social and economic aspects in 100 years?

> **Win Aung:** I don’t see Burmese cartoons having a smooth history in the
> later period of this timeframe. Burmese cartoons have a good origin story.
> Sayagyi Shwetalay started his cartoon work in the period of the independence
> struggle. Though Burma was at that time under colonial rule, there was a
> certain degree of freedom of expression. Burma then regained its
> independence, and in the time of Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League, there
> was also freedom of expression. The most striking example is cartoons of
> Saya U Ba Gyan, and taking at look at them, one can know (that there was
> freedom of expression). Then there came the caretaker government, then the
> Revolutionary Council, and finally one-party dictatorship under the Burma
> Socialist Program Party (BSPP). Then, the degree of freedom of expression
> cartoonists had enjoyed gradually decreased. Cartoonists had fewer things to
> draw cartoons about.

**Aye Chan Myae:** U Maung, would you tell me about the situation of
cartoonists and their freedom of expression in this age?

> **Maung Maung Aung:** I have now written cartoons for around 45 years. In
> these 45 years, cartoonists have been on the side of the people, reflecting
> the economic, social and political situations of the country. Now, it seems
> that we get somewhat more freedom after years of restriction. So, more
> people are [drawing](https://globalvoices.org/2015/03/11/cartoons-condemn-
> state-brutality-in-myanmar-after-police-thugs-attack-student-rally/)
> cartoons. There are two types of cartoonist. The first are cartoonists who
> takes the art form as his life and the second are opportunistic cartoonists.
> There has been some impact on those who have continuously engaged in cartoon
> art with deep faith. There is an unwritten code of conduct among
> cartoonists, according to what we have learnt from our seniors. Previously,
> there were prohibitions on things such as mocking the poor and the disabled
> and making personal attacks. It is more important (not to do such things) in
> this democratic era. To an artist, democracy is like a double-edged sword.
> While it can be used to stab others, it can also hurt the artist. So, it is
> not true that cartoonists can draw as they please. They will have to take
> responsibility for their actions when the law of democracy flourishes for
> some time.

**Aye Chan Myae:** What do you think of ethics among cartoonists, U Win Aung?

> **Win Aung:** Mainly, what is important for a cartoonist is his faith.
> Cartoonists should make sure their creations reflect the life of people.
> Many say that cartoonists or journalists should not be biased, but must be
> neutral. It is wrong. They should have bias. They must. By bias, I don’t
> mean prejudice. If one side is right and another is wrong, which side they
> would stand for? Of those who oppress and those who are oppressed, which
> side they would stand for? They have to take a position. If a cartoonist has
> adopted a firm position and are to draw cartoons from that position, they
> have to think about ethics. For example, if the political system is bad, we
> can draw things about those who create that system, but we are not supposed
> to draw things about the personal lives of the creators of that system.
