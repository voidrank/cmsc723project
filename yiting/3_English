A village council in the Indian state of
[Bihar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar) [banned the use of mobile phones
by women](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/05/us-india-phones-elopement-
idUSBRE8B407E20121205) in the Sunderbari village, roughly 385 kilometers (239
miles) east of Patna, the capital of
[Bihar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar). The population of Bihar is 104
million, larger than any European country and one third the population of the
United States.

The most recent ban, comes after a July ban on mobile phones for girls in the
Baghpat district of [Uttar Pradesh](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/up-
panchayat-bans-love-marriages-bars-women-from-using-mobile-
phones/1/207792.html). This was followed by a ban in August on mobile phones
for girls under age 18 in Jhunjhunu district's Udaipurwati in Rajasthan,
according to [The Times of
India](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-26/jaipur/33402047_1_panchayat-
members-mobile-phones-cellphones).

In Rajasthan, the ban was issued so that girls would not be “spoiled” by
excessive use of cellphones. In UP the ban on mobile phones also included a
ban on women under the age of 40 going shopping un-escorted by a man. Overall
the bans target women's freedom and mobility. A local resident
[said](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-25/jaipur/33384271_1_mobile-
phones-minor-girls-cell-phones):

> It has been observed that mobile phones have given ‘unnecessary’ freedom to
> girls, which is distracting them from following our culture. The Panchayat’s
> decision will be followed strictly in the village as it has been accepted by
> all.

In the most recent case, in Bihar, the [village officials
claim](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2243481/Indian-women-banned-
using-mobile-phones-council-claims-encourage-to.html) mobile phones were
“debasing the social atmosphere” by leading to couples eloping. In recent
times the “elopement” from these villages have been increasing rapidly. The
council has also imposed a fine of 10,000 rupees ($180) if a girl is caught
using a mobile phone on the streets and married women would have to pay 2,000
rupees ($36.60).

Jagmati Sangwan, vice president of the All India Democratic Women’s
Association, said that the men who head such village councils “want women to
get cut off from the processes of modernization, education and employment.”
She said they that such laws, targeting only one segment of society, are not
legal, according to [India
Ink](http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/bihar-village-bans-women-and-
girls-from-using-mobile-phones/).

[Techdirt](http://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20121205/08294221238/indian-
village-bans-unmarried-women-girls-using-mobile-phones.shtml) reported: this
is not about “eroding the moral fabric of society”, but about power, and in
particular the erosion of traditional male power in the village.

Local officials [have begun
investigations](http://ayoolagoke.blogspot.com/2012/12/indian-village-bans-
use-of-mobile.html) saying such bans cannot be allowed in a healthy society.

While some twitter reactions from India have been surprised at the ban, and
seem to blame it on the predominantly Muslim population of the village,
religion does not explain bans in other regions of India.

[Kavitha Rao](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/07/indian-
village-ban-mobile-phones-women) notes that mobile phones may be the single
most empowering technology for Indian women. In other areas of Bihar, [mobile
phones are being
used](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where_we_work/asia/india/india_sdp_empowering_chw_ma_mk.html)
by activists and social workers to work on areas such as health and education
and it contributed to results such as decrease in maternal mortality rates.

Let's hope the real India stops restricting women's freedom and mobility.
