Can Twitter be used to save people's lives or improve their health? During
[the clashes that took place in Tahrir Square in Egypt last
month](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/21/egypt-the-revolution-is-
back/), a Twitter account
(@[TahrirSupplies](https://twitter.com/#!/TahrirSupplies)) was created to
[arrange the delivery of medical
supplies](https://twitter.com/#!/TahrirSupplies/status/142324767456890880) to
the field hospitals set up by volunteers in and around the square, as well as
food and other items needed there. Healthy Egypt Tips, on the other hand, was
a different initiative by a group of volunteers who started a Twitter account
(@[HealthyEgypt](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt)) in August in order to
spread health awareness tips in Egypt.

Here is one of their tips:

> A few miniature servings of coffee at intervals works better than one large
> mug to keep you alert and focused.

They also [reply to people's
questions](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt/status/119396370401607681),
[help peer
initiatives](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt/status/138588559052505088),
and spread

[education](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt/status/117598604826378240) as
well where culture makes it [embarrassing to ask sexual
questions](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt/status/116944046395637761).

**Who are you and tell us more about your initiative.**

> We are a group of volunteers, it started as my wife _Iman Ismail_ and myself
> _Kareem Mossad_ , then we added a doctor friend who is _Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim_

**It's written in your bio that you are sharing 100% credible and verified
information. So we have to ask you: Are you doctors? How do you normally get
your medical information, confirm it, and answer people's questions?**

> My wife and I are health activists and enthusiasts. We are not doctors yet
> we've been in community service for quite a while. We have one code of
> conduct as that for any medical information we provide to our followers, is
> that we need to double check it, by checking more than once source for
> credible well known health websites, or verify with “Ahmed Ibrahim” who is
> the third person (doctor) helping in this initiative.

**Is the account sponsored by any commercial entity or an NGO's? I've noticed
for example that you sometimes refer to brand names. Are you affiliated with
them somehow?**

> We're not officially sponsored by any commercial or NGO yet. However, we've
> received a couple of proposals, but we weren't ready for that step yet.

**How long have you been raising awareness online? Do you have plans to have
presence outside Twitter, such as Facebook, blogs, etc?**

> We [started in
> August](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt/status/100890587900809216),
> around mid-Ramadan, and the followers response was pretty impressive, we
> bought “[www.healthyegypt.org](http://www.healthyegypt.org/) and
> [www.healthyegypt.net](http://www.healthyegypt.net)“, and we're currently in
> the programming phase for our website so we can launch soon.

**Also we noticed that you almost only tweet in English? Aren't you planning
to tweet in Arabic? Don't you think English will limit your audience inside
Egypt somehow?**

> You're absolutely right, we do tweet in Arabic
> [sometimes](https://twitter.com/#!/HealthyEgypt/status/100902807250538496)
> but not regularly, and it’s definitely on our plans with the website which
> will be in both languages so we can attract more visitors to it.
>
> We are also getting
> [positive](https://twitter.com/#!/_OEssam_/status/100904081882750976)
> [feedback](https://twitter.com/#!/Disuky/status/100905087471321088) via
> Twitter from people who are
> [expressing](https://twitter.com/#!/goldilockks/status/100914230655594496)
> [how much such information is helping
> them](https://twitter.com/#!/FireStarter_21/status/100923249319350272) and
> [raising
> awareness](https://twitter.com/#!/3awadalla/status/100967981730889728)
> [about untouched
> issues](https://twitter.com/#!/3awadalla/status/100967110456520704).

This is one way Twitter is being used to spread health awareness in society.
