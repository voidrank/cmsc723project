[Mohamed Maree](http://egytimes.org/) is not the first Egyptian blogger to
loose he job because of what he writes in his blog, as he has been preceded by
[Founon](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2010/02/bad-day-for-blogging-
in-egypt-yesterday.html) and [Ahmed El
Droubi](http://salomatakmatak.blogspot.com/2006/06/ahmed-el-droubi-fired-from-
his-job.html), but he is the most recent one to loose his job because of his
writings. [Zeinobia elaborates more on the
issue](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2011/01/mohamed-maree-loses-his-
job-because-of.html): “Maree was working in a pharmaceutical company for two
and half months when suddenly the administration of that company decided to
terminate his contract because the company found out about he has got
political activities and his views are against the Egyptian government”. [She
then wonders](http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2011/01/mohamed-maree-
loses-his-job-because-of.html): “Do we have to blog anonymously in order to
keep our jobs!!?”
