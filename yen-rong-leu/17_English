Cup](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/) will kick off in about three weeks and
bloggers across the Levant have already been busy using their keyboards and
camera shutters trying to capture the hysteria that engulfs the world once
every four years.

Syrian and Lebanese national teams have never qualified to the World Cup
finals, yet that does not stop people from being hardcore fans and showing
their admiration to their favorite teams in any way possible. While Lebanese
blogger Rami from the [_+961_](http://www.plus961.com/2010/05/13/overdoing-
the-world-cup-2010/) blog was content with certain aspects of the football
fever, he was not impressed by some of what his compatriots are doing. He
says:

> people are getting those mini flags for their cars and balconies, it might
> seem silly but it’s cool as long as it makes people deviate a bit from the
> political discussions.
>
> Still, it really is pathetic when you get a flag that is more than 1 meter
> in width or length! I’m pretty sure you could have put that spent money for
> a better use!

From Syria, _Nasdaq_ on the other hand was occupied with analyzing the
different reasons people get behind a certain team, [highlighting religion as
a
factor](http://mhabach.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-2010/)[ar]:

> تطالعنا الأخبار كل فترة حول إسلام احد اللاعبين بالتالي زيادة شهرته في العالم
> الإسلامي وتوجه الناس لتشجيعه وتشجيع فريقه وحمل صوره و و و فقط لأنه أصبح
> مسلماً و لذا تشجعه .

Every once in a while we hear that a player became a Muslim thus making him a
star in the Islamic world, where people start cheering for him and his team in
droves and carrying his pictures, etc. Only because he became a Muslim and
only for that.

And he goes on to comment on the “resourcefulness” of the Syrian youth who
can't afford to pay for premium channels so they decode them and watch the
games for free instead:

> طبعا لا احد يشك بقدرة الشباب السوري على تجاوز كل المعيقات التي تظهر أمامه –
> عدا المعيقات الرسمية – للوصول إلى أهدافه ، منذ أن كانت مجموعة محطات ART بأوج
> قوتها قام بعض الشباب باختراق شيفرة الترميز للبطاقات، ومع دخول الجزيرة
> الرياضية وغيرها تحركت مواهب الشباب وأصبح لدينا جيش من خبراء فك التشفير الذين
> لم يدرسوا في الجامعات ولم يقرأوا كتب في هذا المجال ، وربما تغلبوا على
> مهندسين في كسر الشيفرات الصعبة ومشاهدة قنوات رياضية مشفرة ومجانا .

Of course no one doubts the abilities of Syrian youth to overcome all the
hurdles that are in the way, apart from governmental ones, to achieving their
goals. Ever since ART channels were in full swing some guys were able to
decode their cards and by the time Al Jazeera Sport was launched we had an
army of decoding experts who did not study it in universities nor learn about
it in books, and perhaps they're more capable than engineers in deciphering
codes and watching premium sports channels for free.

[_Lolitto_](http://lolittto.wordpress.com/) comments by saying that she's
cheering for the Italian team and the reply comes swiftly from _Nasdaq_ :

> You're a girl, so it's only normal that you're cheering for Italy. When my
> nana (grandmother) was young, she also cheered for the Italian team and they
> were even more handsome than they are now according to her.

And _Independence '05_ blog [, from Lebanon, publishes more

And like the others, she dwells a little on the reasons of the somewhat
excessive expressions of excitement for world cup, but reaches the same
conclusion:

> the result? It's FUN FUN FUN.
