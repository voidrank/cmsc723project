Throughout Latin America, free software matters for many countries and people,
who have chosen to use these resources for use in their public administration,
as well as to find solutions for other challenges. For example in Cuba, [the
free software movement](http://www.softwarelibre.cdr.cu/) has helped with
sustainable development. The Ecuadorian government has put forth public
policies that have
[embraced](http://www.somoslibres.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1099)
Free Software, similar to what another regional leader in free software and
free culture, Brazil.

On April 24, 2010, many promoters and users of free software in Latin American
celebrated with a party called FLISOL2010, as explained by
[Leo](http://leogg.wordpress.com/):

> FLISOL is the [Latin American Free Software Installation
> Festival](http://installfest.info/), an event organized by the Latin
> American free software community since 2005. FLISOL takes place on the
> fourth Saturday of April every year. The sixth edition of FLISOL was
> celebrated last weekend, on April 24, 2010. Today, FLISOL is undoubtedly the
> biggest FOSS event in Latin America and maybe even the biggest single
> installfest on the planet. The 2010 edition of FLISOL was organized
> simultaneously in 20 countries and 250 cities all over Latin America and,
> for the first time, in Europe (three local events in Spain).

Each and every celebration across the region is unique. For example, in
Antigua, Guatemala, they broke a
[Piñata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%B1ata) to celebrate free software,
which was only one of the activities organized by
[Antigualug](http://www.antigualug.org/flisol/flisol-antigua-2010), a group of
Linux users.

This is just a small window to show you how free software in Latin America
created a network of interconnected youth, from each and every social,
political and ethnic background, collaborating and innovating together. A
“shared platform” promoting a “shared culture”, for more information and
connections you can read in the[ Latin American Free Software Planet
[es]](http://planeta.flisol.info/).
