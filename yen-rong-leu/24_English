As is the norm with any major tournament especially the World Cup, the 2010
World Cup has its song out approximately a month to the event. The song
features world renowned Latino female singer [Shakira

[WorldCupBlog ](http://www.worldcupblog.org/world-cup-2010/waka-waka-official-
world-cup-2010-song-by-shakira.html)has nothing against Shakira but why should
the song be sung by a Colombian?:

Shakira featuring Freshly Ground – Waka Waka(This is Africa) Source: World Cup
2010 Theme Song

> …I’ve nothing against Shakira. But does it seem odd to anyone else that the
> official song for the World Cup in South Africa will be sung by a hot
> Colombian lady? True, she’s backed up by South African band Freshlyground,
> but it’s very much Shakira front and center here.  
>  It continues and gives us a brief history of the original track, Zangalewa
> by group formerly known as Golden Sounds now known by the title song which
> made them famous across the continent

Apparently, the song does not fit the event:

> The only problem is that the catchy part – the chorus – is borrowed from the
> popular song ‘Zangaléwa’ by the Cameroonian band originally known as Golden
> Sounds (who later changed their name to Zangaléwa because the song was so
> popular). The band was apparently made up of ex-Cameroonian military who
> were fond of dressing up and acting silly. Apparently the lyrics are in the
> Fang dialect of Cameroon, and the key refrain of ‘zangaléwa’, translates as
> ‘who sent you?’ Which is at least fitting for a World Cup. Some further (but
> not much further) interpretation comes from the Latino music blog Guanabee.
> The song, music historians say, is a criticism of black military officers
> who were in league with whites to oppress their own people. Or at least,
> some of it was. Some of it, as far was we can surmise, is gibberish.

[KennyNaija](http://www.kennynaija.com/2010/05/shakiras-world-cup-song-isnt-
going-over.html), a blogger from Nigeria, captures the controversy the song
brewed in South African radio stations:

> The song hit radio stations last week, with Johannesburg locals responding
> with comments like “It's horrible” and “How is Shakira going to sing the
> African part of it?” (My guess is with her voice, but a Speak & Spell could
> be a fun choice, too.). The Colombian singer collaborated with South African
> band Freshlyground on the track, which borrows from a Cameroonian song
> called “Zangalewa.” But the fact that the anthem for South Africa's World
> Cup is not being sung by a South African is the sticking point for the
> critics who aren't just opposed to the new tune itself.

He also captures Sepp Blatter’s thoughts of the song as well as Shakira’s
comments on the honour of getting selected to do the song:

> The Official Song is as much awaited by the fans as the Mascot or the Logo.

Brown Shuga of JustCurious, an entertainment blog, [says he loves the song but
has a problem with the official

He takes us through the history of the song:

> Zamina” or “Zangaléwa” is a 1986 hit song, originally sung by a makossa
> group from Cameroon called Golden Sounds who were beloved throughout the
> continent for their silly dances and costumes. The song was such a hit for
> Golden Sounds that they eventually changed their name to Zangaléwa, too.The
> song pays tribute to African skirmishers (a.k.a tirailleurs) during WW2.
> Most of the band members were in the Cameroonian Army themselves and used
> make up, fake belly and fake butt for comic relief. The song is still used
> today by soldiers, policemen, boy scouts, sportsmen and their supporters,
> usually during training or for rallying. It is also widely used in schools
> throughout the country as a marching song and almost everyone in the country
> knows the chorus of the song by heart.
