Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva will not back down as he ordered the
military to continue the
[operations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/15/thailand-protest-
blockade-ends-in-violence/) against Red Shirt protesters in Bangkok. Abhisit
insists the violent dispersal of protesters is justified to bring back
stability in the capital. He also accused a minority of Red Shirt “terrorists”
of trying to instigate more violence in the country.

The Red Shirts have been protesting in the streets for the [two
months](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/12/thailand-citizen-videos-of-
violent-clash/) already. They are demanding the resignation of the Prime
Minister whom they accuse of being illegitimate and undemocratic. They also
want the Prime Minister to dissolve the parliament and call for new elections.
There were negotiations to settle the protest peacefully but they bogged down
a few days ago.

The initial members of the Red Shirt movement were supporters of ousted Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra but today the Red Shirt is also composed of groups
and individuals who want democratic reforms in Thai society.

[Burning
tires](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTQB1Dhy2i8&feature=player_embedded) and
grenade blasts have rocked the Red Shirt protest zone. Here is a citizen video
footage

Eyewitness accounts have been uploaded on the web. For example, [Nick
Nostitz](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2010/05/16/nick-nostitz-in-
the-killing-zone/) was inside the “killing zone”.
_[Vaitor](http://www.vaitor.com/?p=1606)_ and _[Riding out the
Economy](http://www.ridingouttheeconomy.com/?p=2297)_ also posted their
observations of the clashes. A
[Facebook](http://www.prachatai.org/english/node/1807) user posted this entry,
“What should I feel when I wake up one day with the dead bodies of Thais in
front of my house?” But netizens are questioning the authenticity of this
expose. Are they [fake dead
bodies](http://www.oknation.net/blog/canthai/2010/05/15/entry-5)?

Kishen, writing for _New Mandala_ , is worried about the social, political and
economic
[impact](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2010/05/15/thailands-
sideshow-is-over/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) of the ongoing
clashes

> But everyone is fighting it out without considering the enormous economic
> and political ramification to Thailand as a whole. Thailand’s economic
> growth for the year will be badly hampered if matters prolong. As it is this
> year’s drought will have a telling impact on country’s exports of agri-
> produce.

> As such, the wounds inflicted on Thailand’s psyche and image in the next few
> days could have a lasting impact on Thailand future growth as a nation.
> That’s a greater wound that all the grenades, .308 bullets and armoured
> personal carriers can inflict on the Thai people

[clashes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sji8B0L7RY4&feature=player_embedded)
between soldiers and protesters

_News in Bangkok_ speculates that
[journalists](http://news.inbangkok.org/?p=2359&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+inbangkok/ZhJY+\(News+in+Bangkok\))
were deliberately targeted by snipers

> I suspected that the shooting of the reporters seemed intentional. I

Jon, via _Greg to Differ_ , writes about the [role of social
media](http://gregtodiffer.com/home/2010/5/14/the-role-of-twitter-in-the-
bangkok-protests.html) in monitoring the Bangkok clashes

> Social media has played a major role in reporting the details of the Bangkok

> personal accounts and opinion have been amplified by Twitter, Facebook and
> blogs to the point where social media is a valuable accompaniment to media
> reports.
