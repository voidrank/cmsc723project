A street in Asir Province, Saudi Arabia, where many women liked to exercise
has recently been shut off to female joggers, as it has been deemed unsafe by
the Haia ( _Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice_ ).

The Haia stated the reasons for its closure were that it is poorly lit and in
an area known for its crime: therefore it was being shut to protect women.
However, many bloggers disagree with this statement, stating there are other
reasons behind its closure.

A commenter on the _[Arab
News](http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article48859.ece)_ on this matter, Ahmed
Faraz Rao, pleads:

> If the place is unsafe for women then please make it safe for women instead
> of banning women from jogging.  
>  If some place is unsafe for people then should people leave that place or
> should police come into action to make it safe?

_Saudi Jeans_ , who points out joggers in the area have stated the street is
both well-lit and safe, [likens the decision to one of a futuristic “pre-
crime” unit](http://saudijeans.org/2010/05/01/commission-bans-women-sports/):

> You can say that this decision by Haia is part preemptive strike, part
> blaming the victim. Instead of watching these so-called unsafe areas and
> protect the women by arresting people who attempt to harass them, they go
> and prevent women from exercising there…Now of course this kind of behavior
> is not at all new or surprising on the part of Haia…

Indeed, _American Bedu_ [points out](http://americanbedu.com/2010/05/09/saudi-
arabia-exercise-can-prove-dangerous-to-women/) the decision is not one without
precedent:

> There has already been intervention by government ministries towards women
> and exercise. Last year many fitness facilities for women were declared
> illegal if they were not approved by government ministries. Instead of being
> viewed as a business, because these were places where women exercised rather
> than shop or get their hair done, government approval was required.

And she goes on to mention the difficulties in maintaining fitness for women
in Saudi Arabia:

> Many of the Saudi schools, primary and secondary, do not have physical
> fitness for children. Women are not encouraged to exercise. Unless a woman
> is very motivated and disciplined to work out within her home, not every
> woman can easily arrange her schedule to go out and walk or organize
> transport and pay the fees to join a private fitness center. On the other
> hand, men can go out in modest shorts and jog as they wish. Fitness centers
> for men are in abundance. One can see the male fitness centers from the
> streets and see the men working out through the large plate glass windows
> which are typical fronts for these facilities.

_American Bedu_ also points out that keeping fit is not about vanity, but
about health. This point is reinforced in the comments to [this
piece](http://saudijeans.org/2010/05/01/commission-bans-women-sports/) where
commentor _Abu Sinan_ points out:

> This is one of the reasons there is a big problem amongst Saudi women with
> diabetes. No exercise, unhealthy food, it all contributes.

Meanwhile, _Qusay_ commenting on _Saudi Jean_ ‘s blog has a more cynical
approach to the matter:

> I would like to bet that someone is selling home exercise equipment and
> trying to ban all activities outside so he would sell more
