A farm boy's online posting about how he and his family watched all their
cattle being slaughtered, has inspired even more public outrage against a
decision by the South Korean government to cull pigs and cows at risk of
contracting [foot-and-mouth disease
](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease)as a
preventive measure. Since April 2010, South Korea has experienced its worst
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, a highly contagious and sometimes fatal
viral disease in animals.

Humans are only rarely affected, but the virus has spread at an alarming rate
in cattle in every region of South Korea as the weather has turned colder (the
virus loses strength in warmer weather). To slow down the outbreak, the South
Korean government decided to cull not only the affected cattle but also
healthy cattle within the danger zones. More than 470 thousand livestock have
been culled so far. It is a catastrophe for the farm industry, and at least
[one devastated farmer is believed to have committed
suicide](http://news.nate.com/view/20101225n02660?mid=n0404) after his cattle
were put down.

The public has criticized the government for failing to provide enough foot-
and-mouth vaccines in time to prevent this partly man-made disaster.

Yoo Dong-il, whose father owns a cow farm, wrote [a detailed journal-style
posting [ko]
](http://bbs3.agora.media.daum.net/gaia/do/story/read?bbsId=S102&articleId=407560)on
_Daum’s Agora_ , one of the most-visited public discussion forums. The Yoo
family owned 121 livestock, all healthy. They were culled with the family
watching, bringing a 13-year old family business to near-collapse. According
to Yoo, the compensation offered by the government for their loss is nowhere
near sufficient – neither financially nor emotionally. The day of culling is
an excruciatingly painful memory to this youngster. Near a thousand comments
were added to Yoo's post and several local media reported on the boy's case.

**Dec. 19. 11:00 PM:** The head of the Livestock division of Paju city called
us and announced that our farm had been earmarked for preventive culling.  
**[](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/03/south-korea-pleas-against-
cattle-killing-in-foot-and-mouth-outbreak/culling2/)Dec 20. Afternoon** : The
city official told us that they will dig (a hole) in the middle of our farm to
bury the livestock. My mom argued with tears that we cannot live in a place
where 121 of our livestock are buried beneath us, and she is also worried
about possible underground water contamination. Responding to my mom's points,
the official decided to postpone the culling for a day, so they can look for
another burial location.

**Dec 21. 3:00 PM** : One man and one woman from the city’s quarantine team
arrived at our farm for culling work. My parents and my younger siblings
protested, cried and begged to express our feelings to this unfair situation.
