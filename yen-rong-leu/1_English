As internet connectivity grows in developing nations, technology is coming to
play vital roles in shaping the trends of social activism and awareness.
Although there is still limited access to internet in countries like
Bangladesh, it is very promising to witness projects that are beginning to use
[ICT](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology) to
address social issues.

[Citizen’s Voice](http://www.nagorikkontho.org/portal/index?l=en_US)
(Nagorikkontho.org) is one such project which has been launched by [Population
Services and Training Center (PSTC)](http://www.pstc-bd.org/) to empower
Bangladeshi public by having their voices heard, especially regarding feedback
on public services. The platform supports both Bangla and English language to
make it versatile for all the users and all the technology platforms (mobile
texting sill do not support Bangla font).

Bangladeshi government agencies have recently defined service deliverables in
their [Citizens Charter](http://www.nagorikkontho.org/portal/menu/ccharter).
Documenting feedback about these services is important for their quality to be
assessed.

Citizen’s Voice [believe](http://www.nagorikkontho.org/portal/about?l=en_US)
that this would help enhance the standard of these services and bridge the
common man to the public authorities:

> “If common people become aware of what are their inalienable rights stated
> in the Citizen Charter, they can understand their needs and performance of
> the public service agencies. Therefore, they can monitor their deserved
> services and raise their voice to the civil societies and respective public
> authorities. This monitoring will further improve their civic facilities and
> augment their living status.”

A stack of bricks in a parking space that shouldn't be there. From Citizen's
Voice.

The portal has been built based on Ushahidi platform and it contains different
reports which cite the irregularities by government institutions, and has
emerged as a watchdog for such irregularities, and media outlets can use it to
locate such issues. One example is a [report about Panchagah Women’s
College](http://www.nagorikkontho.org/portal/reports/view/935?l=en_US). The
college was charging students a fee for entrance forms more than double as
high as was sanctioned by the government.

After Citizen’s Voice published the report, the media took notice, and college
authorities were ordered by the board of education to revise their fees. This
is one example of how something as apparently simple as a digital report
published on a website can actually be significant enough to make a practical
impact on ground. To facilitate access to a common man, reports can be
submitted via sms, email or through a web form.

The header on the site lists a number of questions, asking about the
availability of common services – such as access to health facilities, free
education, and so forth. ‘If not, please send a report,’ it says. Reports can
also be submitted in the form of a video, photo or a blog post. One video
listed on the website by maaDiyan on YouTube shows a busride on “the busiest
highway of Bangladesh” between Dhaka and Bandarban, and how drivers skirt
traffic rules to get ahead faster.

> We were taking the bus back to Dhaka from Bandarban. I think it was on 10
> Sep 2011. I was wondering if there were any changes to how people drive on
> highways in Bangladesh, after so much was going on about road safety. I got
> my answer. These drivers are simply crazy. There were enough traffic signs
> on the road, but I have a suspicion that these bus drivers think those are
> there for decorative purpose only.

In these ways, Citizens’ Voice offers a democratic space for interaction
between service recipients and providers through technology.
