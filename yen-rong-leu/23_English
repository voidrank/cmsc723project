Good news: Cambodians can now organize a protest action against the government
without a fear of being violently dispersed by the police.

Bad news: Protests are only allowed in the newly established [Freedom
Park](http://ki-media.blogspot.com/2010/05/cambodia-has-freedom-
park.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot/bmaW+\(KI+Media\)).
And protesters need a permit to use the Freedom Park.

The Freedom Park is located far from government buildings and the parliament.
Assemblies that number more than 200 are allowed if the organizers are able to
secure a permit. The Freedom Park can accommodate about 5,000 people. The
government has announced that protests in other areas will be outlawed.

Cambodia's Freedom Park. Political cartoon by Sacravatoons

Some bloggers have described the Freedom Park as [“Round-up Park”](http://ki-
media.blogspot.com/2010/05/sacravas-political-cartoon-freedom-
to.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot/bmaW+\(KI+Media\))
or “Deprived Freedom Park.” _The Son of the Khmer Empire_
[reacts](http://sokheounpang.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/freedom-park-or-
deprived-freedom-park/):

> In my point of view this so-called freedom park is usless and it will be
> constitutionally used as a suppressing instrument for Hun Xen (Prime
> Minister of Cambodia) government to successfully deprive the freedom of the
> assembly of the people of Cambodia if the Demonstration Law is not amended.

The blogger is referring to the [Demonstration Law](http://ki-
media.blogspot.com/2009/06/critics-decry-demonstration-law.html) which was
passed last June 2009 which critics cited as a repressive legal measure. The
law allows protests to take place only between 6am to 6pm in a designated
freedom park.

But some commenters are happy with the establishment of a Freedom Park. Here
