Lack of access to care for HIV positive people has been well documented on the
African continent. Many initiatives strive to show that things could improve
with collective effort, and among them is the [Drug Resource Enhancement
against AIDS and
Malnutrition](http://dream.santegidio.org/public/news/x__newsreadpubNS.asp?IdNews=285&Curlang=EN)
(DREAM) program.

DREAM was created in 2002 by the [Sant'Egidio
Community](http://www.santegidio.org/index.php?idLng=1064&pageID=1&res=1) in
Mozambique, and takes a comprehensive approach to fighting HIV/AIDS. Cristina
Cannelli, leader of the Guinea DREAM program, [explains the special
relationship](http://www.santegidio.org/index.php?pageID=64&id=8261&idLng=1063)
[it] with the African continent, especially Mozambique:

The Sant'Egidio community is deeply linked to Africa, in part because the
community itself is anchored on the continent. The community is present in 26
African nations and has more than 20,000 members. A special relationship
exists with Mozambique because in 1992, the Sant’Egidio community contributed
to the peace treaty agreement that ended the civil war. That's why Mozambique
was the first choice for implementing the DREAM program.

Today DREAM is present in Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Guinea (Conakry), Guinea
(Bissau), Nigeria, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The
basic [philosophy of the
program](http://dream.santegidio.org/public/news/x__newsreadpubNS.asp?IdNews=274&Curlang=EN)
is:

> … DREAM has been created to achieve excellence: excellence in treatment and
> diagnostics, in computerization. DREAM demands that western standards be
> adopted in Africa too; the programme routinely uses viral load assessment,
> and has introduced [Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy
> (HAART)](http://dream.santegidio.org/public/news/x__newsreadpubNS.asp?IdNews=253&Curlang=EN)

**A DREAM success**

The [sheer
numbers](http://dream.santegidio.org/public/news/x__newsreadpubNS.asp?IdNews=256&Curlang=EN)
of the DREAM activity throughout the continent are impressive: 150,000 people
have been treated of which 25,000 were aged 15 years or younger, 65,000
patients have benefited from anti-retroviral therapy of which 6,000 were
children. DREAM also successfully interrupted vertical mother-to-child HIV
transmission for 14,000 births from HIV positive mothers.

Since the beginning of the program more than 1,000,000 people have benefited
from the DREAM program via health education, water filtration, food supplies,
mosquito nets, prevention programmes on television, radio and the workplace.
In total, the DREAM centers have performed 1,300,000 medical consultations,
276,000 viral load tests and 540,000 CD4 tests.

For such a large organisation to run properly in so many countries with many
different spoken languages, qualified personnel is a must, which is why the
community has organized 18 workshops throughout the continent for 4,000 health
professionals. Mobile teams travel to reach the most isolated patients.

In order to engage the local institutions, DREAM [states
that](http://dream.santegidio.org/public/Centri/x__CentriDream.asp):

> Some of these structures are operational thanks to collaboration and
> agreements reached with local health centres that have replicated the
> programme.

However, patients also are actively contributing by committing to [actively
fight](http://dream.santegidio.org/public/news/x__newsreadpubNS.asp?IdNews=231&Curlang=EN)
the HIV pandemic by becoming volunteers:

> In each and every DREAM centre, medical and paramedical personnel are
> flanked by local men and women who have decided to commit themselves to
> working for patients who come to our centres. They decided to do so when
> their own lives were remarkably transformed after they came in contact with
> our services.  
>  There are relatively large groups of such people and they constitute an
> indispensable resource for the success of the programme. Most, but not all,
> of them are sick. They are our “campaigners”.
