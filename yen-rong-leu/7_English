Julie Kertesz is someone who celebrates her 77 years of age as she celebrates
life itself. Retired but very active, Julie defines herself as a
[storyteller](http://competentcommunicator.blogspot.com/) and
[photographer](http://www.flickr.com/people/joyoflife/). She is also a
prolific [blogger](http://www.blogger.com/profile/09196066571782981915), a
[videomaker](http://www.dailymotion.com/julie70) and is just getting started
in [stand up
comedy](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2011/02/interactions.html).

She was born in Transylvania (then part of Hungary, later Romania), moved to
France at the age of 30, and [ has lived in London since July
2008](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2008/03/arrival-to-london.html).

According to one of her followers on the photography sharing website, Flickr,
[Patrick Barry Barr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/barrybar/), she is a “role-
model to people of all ages who desire to lead full and active lives of
learning and doing.” [He said](http://www.flickr.com/people/joyoflife/) (in
2005):

> [Julie70](http://www.flickr.com/people/joyoflife/) exhibits a spirit that
> belies her age, as we tend to think of people in their 70’s, and I marvel at
> her enthusiasm, the way in which she relishes meeting strangers and sharing
> her enthusiasm with them. I will be 67 on 11 May, and when I grow up I want
> to be just like Julie Kertesz.

Self portrait – Julie Kertesz

Julie loves learning and has never stopped studying – not even when it was
[forbidden by the communist regime of
Romania](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2010/06/studying-in-cafe.html).
While working in Paris, she returned to the classroom as a mother of two, only
to leave university at age 43 with a PhD in physics.

As she describes in [her life
story](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2011/01/my-lifes-story.html) on her
blog, [there _is_ life after
70](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2010/01/no-more-snow.html):

> We are not giving up!  
>  Each of us does something, either to live better or to rest alive.  
>  Alas, I met also old people who looks as if they did already give up, and
> even some very young ones.  
>  Lonely, in the metro.  
>  Just look at them in the metro of Paris. How different with the man I met
> yesterday, working in the market. And so many others of us, living our lifes
> as full as possible.  
>  Ok, we have a certain age, but we do not feel old inside!

Julie uses Flickr, blogs, and personal storytelling to inspire others. In a
comment on her blog entitled [“Courage to laugh at
yourself”](http://julie70.blogspot.com/2011/09/courage-de-rire-de-soi-
meme.html) (in French) a reader shows
[appreciation](http://julie70.blogspot.com/2011/09/courage-de-rire-de-soi-
meme.html?showComment=1316027529941#c4238247306860679455) for her endeavors:

> […] tu sais Julie, tu es Une Sage, je le pense. Tu m'aides souvent dans des
> moments compliqués, je me dis “attends, l'effet Julie va se produire, ça va
> aller”.

[…] you know, Julie, I think you are a wise-woman. You often help me in my
complicated moments, I tell myself “wait, the Julie effect will materialise,
it will be OK”.

Perhaps the source of such wisdom is [the readiness to dare to experience
something new](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2011/09/eurotunnel-j.html).
In the [video below](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xdts4d_first-times-
version-1_creation), Julie uses her fourth language to illustrate some of her
first-time experiences between the ages of 25 to 70:

It was precisely at the age of 70 that Julie discovered
[photography](http://www.flickr.com/people/joyoflife/). In 2006, [she
created](http://julie70inlondon.blogspot.com/2011/07/differences.html) the
[!afterclass! group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/afterclass), a masterclass
on Flickr where 2,500 people get together to learn photography. She also
created the [people reading group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/reading/); the
[never too old group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/nevertoold/); and
[strangers no more](http://www.flickr.com/groups/strangersnomore/):

> No more strangers. I met them, I spoke to them. I remember them.

This last group inspires people to approach others and, with every
interaction, a beautiful human being is unveiled. Click on the pictures below
to discover the [delightful stories Julie uncovered through “human
Interactions” with
strangers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joyoflife/sets/1117580/).
