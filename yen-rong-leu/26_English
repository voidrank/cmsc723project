Saudi Arabia's citizen media community pulled all the stops to cover
torrential rains which struck Riyadh today.

A dedicated [blog](http://www.riyadhrain.com/) was set up in hours to
aggregate content from _Twitter_ and _YouTube_ , featuring _Twitter_ updates
and videos uploaded on to video sharing site _YouTube_. The blog is entitled
_The Riyadh Rain Catastrophe_.

This video by

shows flooded roads and cars manoeuvring their way through the floods, with
onlookers cheering the brave drivers:

People wading through the ‘lakes’ formed by the rain can also be seen.

This video also shows cars making their way through the ‘rivers’ as well as
several stalled cars, which did not survive the experience. In one clip, a
truck is speeding through the water, trying to overtake a Land Cruiser.
