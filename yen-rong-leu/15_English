Last week a Malaysian-registered tanker
[collided](http://www.mpa.gov.sg/sites/global_navigation/news_center/mpa_news/mpa_news_detail.page?filename=nr100525.xml)
with a bulk carrier in the Singapore Strait causing some 2,000 tonnes of crude
oil to spill into the sea. The oil slick has affected the marine life in the
coastal areas of Singapore.

A facebook page was created – _[Singapore Changi East Oil
Spill](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Singapore-Changi-East-Oil-
Spill-25-May-2010/122043691162433)_ – to monitor and document the disaster and
to call for
[volunteers](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=122043691162433&topic=81)
in the cleanup drive. Lim Wei Ling posts this status update on her facebook
page about what she
[witnessed](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=4283088&id=595431784&op=1&subj=122043691162433&view=all&aid=-1&oid=122043691162433&comments&ref=mf)
in one of the affected beaches of Singapore

> Was at Tanah Merah with a friend yesterday. The impact area is actually
> quite large. Also, some globules of oil have already sunken and rolling on
> the sea floor. Marine creatures there were lethargic due to the lack of
> oxygen in the waters. Dead and struggling creatures were also seen…sad.
> However, we saw plenty of sand stars…they seem to beholding up better =)

_Musings from the Lion City_ thought the [“strange smell”](http://hardhitting-
nobs.blogspot.com/2010/05/spill-baby-spill.html) in Singapore last week came
from a forest fire

> Yesterday at around 1pm, I smelled something strange. It smelled like
> something between drying paint and something burning. Since it was a very
> hot day yesterday, I thought it was a forest fire somewhere.
>
> With our busy waterways and all the ships docked at our ports due to the
> economic slowdown, I fear this may not be the last time I smell this.

_Wild Shores of Singapore_ asks netizens to [document the threatened marine
life](http://wildshores.blogspot.com/2010/05/what-can-shore-lovers-do-about-
oil.html) of Singapore

> A sense of deep helpless outrage is what I feel as the oil spill affects the
> marinelife on our shores. I just heard that the spill has hit Chek Jawa as
> well as Changi beach between Carpark 6 and Carpark 7.
>
> It's impossible to save all the creatures. What should a shore lover do
> about the situation?
>
> It is wonderful to see large numbers of volunteers wanting to do something
> about the situation.
>
> But ‘cleaning’ sea creatures is almost impossible to do without stressing
> them. And once the oil clogs gills, the animals are probably doomed even if
> the oil is cleaned off externally. And if we want to ‘clean’ marine life, we
> need to use seawater.
>
> The most beautiful and delicate of marine creatures are impossible to wash
> or relocate quickly: hard corals, sea anemones, sea fans. Some animals that
> don't seem worthy of ‘saving’ such as worms, are actually among the
> important elements of the shore ecosystem, forming the base of the food
> chain.
>
> So what is a shore lover to do?
>
> In my opinion, we should document as much as we can. Focusing not just on
> the distress and death to marine life, but also the amazing diversity life
> on our shores (from worms to fishes, corals to seagrass) and how the spill
> is affecting them.

_Colourful Clouds_ took pictures of [dead marine
creatures](http://colorclouds.blogspot.com/2010/05/aftemath-of-oil-spill-
tanah-merah.html) in the affected coastal areas

> As we reached the shore, the pungent gas fumes fill the air! Making it a bit
> hard to breathe. I came prepared with a mask and tied a piece of towel
> around. It was much better but still a fade amount of the fumes can be
> smelled!
>
> On the high shores, we see signs of the oil stains on the sand.
>
> Sigh…..it is just heartbreaking seeing so many dead marine creatures!
> Hopefully the oil spill can be cleared soon and that the shores can recover
> once again!

KCK reports that the oil sludge has reached the [shores of
Singapore](http://waterqualityinsingapore.blogspot.com/2010/05/what-will-
happen-to-all-this-oil-oil.html)

> The oil spill has apparently hit our shores despite earlier comments that it
> might vaporise before reaching land. The argument was being a light crude,
> the spill could vaporise easily

in the Singapore Strait also took place in 1997, 2000, 2004. Maybe marine
authorities have to answer what blogger _Singapore Life and Times_ is
[asking](http://singaporelifetimes.blogspot.com/2010/05/tank-tanker.html)
