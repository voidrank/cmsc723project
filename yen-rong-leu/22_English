many homes, children are [not allowed to watch
news](http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Development/TV-News-Too-Violent-
for-Children) because their parents believe that newscasts on TV might be to
traumatic or violent. So how can children find out about national and world
affairs? In Burma, Zambia, Surinam, South Africa, Peru, Indonesia, the Dutch
Caribbean and Mozambique, children now have the opportunity to watch TV news
magazines that are specifically geared towards them, also giving them a space
to voice their opinions and find out about current events.

All of these newscasts are coordinated and supported during their first two
years by [Freevoice](http://www.freevoice.nl/cms/view/53/ ) from the
Netherlands, they are aired on national television networks in their
countries, and many of the projects are also turning to the internet as a
better mean of getting children's feedback and including more of them in the
process of suggesting topics and approaches to news.

In Peru, we have [NAPATV](http://napa.com.pe/), where the letters NAPA stand
for the phrase in Spanish that means not for adult consumption (No Apto para
Adultos). Through the website youth can see the different videos, comment on
them, leave a message on the chat board and participate on online polls. They
also have a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/No-Apto-Para-
Adultos-NAPA/89001169457?ref=ts), [twitter](http://twitter.com/napatv) and
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/napatv) accounts. On this daily 30
minute show kids ask the president questions, tell the world what they would
like to be when they grow up, discuss current events, and also say in front of
the cameras what they dislike. [For
example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJHrsKpRxQs) [es]: Kevin, age 15,
tells NAPA that he dislikes it when neighborhood security guards tell them
they can't skateboard on the streets with his friends because they will
“damage the pavement and plants”.

[Following](http://napa.com.pe/2010/04/30/resumen-noticias-30-abril/) is a
[short news review section ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogJ5IURtHAs)where
subjects such as permits for school buses and transport, mining companies and
environment and school children with high levels of lead in their blood are
discussed [es]:

The [Caribbean Kids Network ](http://www.cknweb.com/) also publishes the
videos on their website, and the subtitled newscasts are both in English and
in Papiamento. There are 5 journalists assigned to the different islands and
they produce together the weekly show. Following is [the latest
episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4YU3TFXzI) [en, pap], where they
follow a protest on the construction of a hotel in Aruba; talk about
counterfeit goods, why they are illegal and how to recognize them, and also
other topics such as green energy and music.

In Myanmar (Burma), the situation is a bit different. There,
[YouthVoices](http://www.dvbyouth.com/) gives children a chance to receive
relevant news. As [freevoice](http://www.freevoice.nl/cms/view/53/) explains:

> Press freedom does not exist in Burma; the military regime detains critics
> on a regular basis and the state television only provides positive news of
> the generals. To produce an uncensored kids news with real news, the DVB
> team works from Thailand and receives its images from Burma through a secret
> network of camjo's (camera journalists). For the safety and protection of
> the journalists and the children being interviewed, the children wear
> (animal)masks in front of the camera, so they cannot be recognized,
> subsequently, they can give their real and honest opinions.

On the [sample newscast made for
YouthVoices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzVgOXgrJ8Y) you can see the masks
being used. In the [latest ones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzv7pwaY1so)
[mya], though, masks are no longer used, but some of those who are interviewed
do have their faces digitally blurred.
