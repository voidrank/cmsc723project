, made of bamboo and Japanese paper, is a beautiful thing. The most common
umbrella however, is this cheap, translucent type made from plastic and vinyl.
It can be bought practically anywhere at kiosks and convenience stores.

‘Only boring rain, no snow’ by kirainet

**Ownership**

Mari at [watashi to
tokyo](http://smt.blogs.com/mari_diary/2006/06/the_most_popula.html) explains
how they are so common that sense of ownership is very low.

Intentional or not, the umbrella stands in front of convenience store doors
are a prime location for umbrella switching and theft. A commenter on Tagame's
blog [recounts a recent
episode](http://ameblo.jp/tagame/entry-10549023441.html):

> 前にちょっといいビニール傘をコンビニの外の傘立てに置いておいたら、出てきた時には骨がさび付いたふる～いビニール傘に変わってました。

I left a relatively expensive vinyl umbrella in the stand in front of a
convenience store. When I came out after a while, it had transformed into an
old, rusted one.

A fed up [@Yutarine](http://twitter.com/Yutarine/statuses/14705948872) darkly
tweeted:

> 雨の日のコンビニで他人の傘をパクる奴には等しく死を。

Death to all who steal other people's umbrellas at convenience stores on rainy
days.

**Weather forecast**

Many people have made it a habit to check the forecast in the morning. [Lester
Ho](http://www.lesterho.com/blog/?p=366) said:

> As you know that the weather report in Japan are 90% accurate and everyone
> will know today’s weather and if it’s going to rain, you can see plenty of

While 90% might be an exaggeration, not being caught off guard (and wet!) is
important. Perhaps it reveals a bit of your habits? [The blogger at Odeon
Apple](http://techo.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2010/05/post-f4b3.html) wonders if
a salesperson with a vinyl umbrella, as opposed to a “real” one, would come
off as a bit hurried and untrustworthy to their customer.

>
> 「この人、朝のニュースや天気予報も見ずに外に出かけ、行った先でビニール傘を買うなんて、準備などがきちんとできない人じゃないだろうか、行き当たりばったりなんじゃないの」と思われそうなこと。

Some might think, “This person left their house without checking the morning
news or forecast, and bought a vinyl umbrella along the way. Such a person
might erratic or not very good at planning ahead.”

Screenshots of the Umbrella app

There's even an [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id331519827?mt=8&ign-
mpt=uo%3D6) from a Japanese company whose sole purpose is to inform whether
you need to bring an umbrella today. The Tokyo Hacker blog introduces it in a
post titled “[Say goodbye to vinyl
umbrellas](http://www.tokyohacker.com/business/iphone-kasa/)” [ja].

**Lost and found**

Umbrellas are #1 in the list of lost properties delivered to the Metropolitan
Police Department. In 2006, there were approximately [430,000
umbrellas](http://www.gov-online.go.jp/useful/article/200710/2.html)
delivered, which accounts for more than 20% of all lost properties.

The Association of Japanese Private Railways even starts their definition of
“lost properties” with a mention of umbrellas in [a dictionary of railway
related terminology](http://www.mintetsu.or.jp/knowledge/term/99.html).

> 大都市の鉄道では、「ひと雨500本」という言葉が示すように、雨が降ると傘の忘れ物が多くなります。

Like the saying “One rain, 500 umbrellas” goes, railway companies in
metropolitan areas receive many lost umbrellas on rainy days.

The city of Kanazawa operates a project that makes use of the piles of
umbrellas that are collected by the railway company each year. They are made
available for free rental in a dozen places, including tourist centers and
buses. Marked with the logo of singer [Eri
Takena](http://www.usmusic.co.jp/erekasa/index.html), they can be returned to
any of the designated spots. Bad habits don't seem to go away, though. A
majority of the umbrellas went unreturned last year – it seems that many
tourists take them home as keepsakes.

It won't be long before the Japan Meteorological Agency officially declares
the beginning of the mainland's rainy season.
