The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union (EU) has sparked a
lively debate in the media and on social networks in Europe and the rest of
the world.

On October 12, The Nobel Committee announced the EU as this year's winner. It
came as a surprise because the EU had not even been among the favorites for
the award. [According to the
committee](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu.html),
the EU deserves the prize:

> **Prize motivation:** “for over six decades contributed to the advancement
> of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe”

[The evolution of the European
Union](http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_2/index_en.htm) began with
creation of the name European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), in line with
the project led by [Robert
Schuman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schuman) and [Jean
Monnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet), who together wrote the
Schuman Declaration. The following is a quote from the declaration:

> Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will
> be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto
> solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the
> elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany.

On March 25, 1957, the ECSC decided to go one step further, forming the
European Economic Community (EEC) that expanded the powers/competition of the
common market to other goods. In the following years, common policies were
created and the number of members was increased, until the European Union came
to be what it is today, with 27 members, its own parliament, an administration
that acts as a legislature for all countries. Both physical and trade borders
have been eliminated between these countries ([Schengen
Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area)).

The prize comes at a time when social rights achieved by Europeans in years of
political stability are suffering a major setback because of the economic
crisis that has highlighted the discord among member states. [The most
prosperous countries of the north blame the crisis on Southern
countries](http://www.presseurop.eu/es/content/article/2653381-una-nueva-
guerra-de-religion) [es], calling them wasteful and corrupt, while the poorer
Southern countries complain about austerity measures imposed by the north,
accusing them of impeding growth and keeping them in such an extreme
situation.

Within hours following the announcement, news, commentaries and articles
flooded the internet in favor and against the award. On Twitter, where the
hashtag #nobel has continued to be a trending topic in countries such as
Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, the majority of messages
oscillate between skepticism and flat out rejection.

Those who support the award argue that in reality, the Nobel has been awarded
to a long-term project whose most significant success has been the longest
period of peace among the member states. Indeed, the member states of the EU
have not suffered a war since World War II. [Dylan
Matthews](http://www.washingtonpost.com/dylan-
matthews/2012/07/16/gJQAH7AyoW_page.html) provides his perspective in his
article [Five reasons why the EU deserved the Nobel Peace
Prize](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/12/five-
reasons-why-the-e-u-deserved-the-nobel-peace-prize/):

On the contrary, David Swanson argues that the EU did not deserve the award on
the website [Dissident Voice](http://dissidentvoice.org/2012/10/why-europe-
did-not-deserve-a-nobel-peace-prize/):

> [The EU] has not during the past year — which is the requirement — or even

> See what Iraq thinks. (…)

> The West is so in love with itself that many will imagine this award a

> Europe going to war with the rest of the world!
