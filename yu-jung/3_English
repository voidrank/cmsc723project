According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), counterfeit medicines are
found [everywhere](http://www.who.int/impact/FinalBrochureWHA2008a.pdf) in the
world. They include mixtures of toxic substances, and inactive, ineffective
preparations; [700,000 people die
annually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZIwOoaCPxI) from fake malaria and
tuberculosis drugs alone. The WHO also reports that the annual earnings from
substandard or counterfeit drugs stand at about [$200 billion
USD](http://www.who.int/impact/FinalBrochureWHA2008a.pdf).

Many innovative solutions are being proposed to help tackle the spread of
counterfeit drugs in developing countries.

**Technological innovations to track counterfeit drugs**

[Ashifi Gogo](https://twitter.com/ashifi) from Ghana is an entrepreneur with
an innovative solution involving mobile phones. In simplified terms, the idea
is to place a scratch-off label on the products; the label contains a unique
code, which the consumer sends via SMS and then receives a reply as to whether
the product is authentic or not.

In this TEDx Boston talk, Ashifi Gogo explains how his solution
[works](https://tedxboston.org/speaker/gogo#) by combining cell phones,
community, and the cooperation of governments and pharmaceutical companies:

After the Duo-Cotecxin incident in Kenya, Holley-Cotec, the company that
manufactures the antimalarial, introduced a new technology to make the tablets
tamper-proof. James Nyikal, director of Medical Services in Kenya
[explains](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Daily-
Reports/2007/August/24/dr00047096.aspx?p=1) :

> New packets of the drugs will have three-dimensional hologram seals and
> other features to indicate the drugs are authentic.

Rajendrani Mukhopadhyay reviews the solutions currently available to identify
genuine medicines. He [shares some surprising
anecdotes](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ac071892p):

> The screening first consists of a close visual inspection. Inspectors
> scrutinize the packages, because they need to be certain that an intention
> exists to deceive the consumer. “If you just have the tablets or the
> capsules, even if they have no active ingredient, it still could have been
> an innocent mistake in the factory. […] Some of the packaging errors on
> counterfeit drugs are quite comical. On one, the expiry date was before the
> manufacturing date, so we knew something wasn’t quite right!”

He also mentions the
[challenges](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ac071892p) of screening
in poor settings:

> Challenges in developing countries mean that investigators have to think
> creatively and come up with effective analytical techniques that cost
> pennies and are robust. “We found out that many of the fake artesunates,
> posing as a particular brand produced in China, contained calcium
> carbonate,” says Green [Michael Green from the U.S. Centers for Disease
> Control and Prevention]. Since the authentic brand did not contain calcium
> carbonate, he and his colleagues were able to distinguish counterfeits from
> the genuine tablets by adding vinegar to bits of the tablets.

**A growing challenge for the developing world**

More important than their economic impact, counterfeit medicines pose a
significant global public health problem. Not only do they endanger the lives
and the well-being of patients, they also undermine confidence in healthcare
systems and health professionals.

The following chart by the Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI) details the
geographical distribution of confirmed counterfeiting incidents in 2011; the
issue is increasingly challenging to tackle for the developing world because
of the growing volume of fake drugs and the required infrastructure.

To the point, PSI [notes](http://www.psi-inc.org/geographicDistributions.cfm):

> The regions that are more frequently linked to incidents are not necessarily
> those with weak enforcement and inspection programs. Rather, countries in
> these regions are effectively identifying pharmaceutical crime through law
> enforcement activity and inspections by drug regulatory agencies.

Despite the innovation mentioned earlier, detecting counterfeit drugs is still
a very difficult task and requires both advanced technology and the capacity
to strictly enforce international regulations.

For instance, many defective and counterfeit antimalarials [were reported in
developing
countries](http://www.romandie.com/news/n/_Nombre_de_medicaments_defectueux_sont_vendus_dans_les_pays_pauvres_72110720120002.asp?)
[fr] this year but only after patients had been treated. In 2012, a study
showed that [one-third of antimalarial
medications](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(12\)70064-6/abstract)
in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging
analysis, or were falsified. In 2007, the Ministry of Health in Kenya issued a
[warning](http://www.pharmacyboardkenya.org/assets/files/HEALTH.pdf) about
counterfeit antimalarial medication Duo-Cotecxin being sold in Nairobi and how
to detect it.

Lawrence Evans, a researcher who has conducted a study in Guyana and Suriname
on the quality of antimalarial drugs
[says](http://www.sciencecodex.com/new_research_reveals_extent_of_poorquality_antimalarial_medicines_in_south_american_countries-95884):

> Besides the presence of medicines not included in the World Health
> Organization malaria treatment guidelines, the ease with which medications
> were procured without accurate diagnosis poses another major risk to
> patients’ safety. In addition, this could have serious implications for the
> development of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium parasites, particularly
> Falciparum, as novel treatments are not foreseeable in the near future.

Prisca in Madagascar [explains](http://www.lagazette-
dgi.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23675:medicaments--halte-
aux-contrefacons&catid=42:societe&Itemid=57) [fr] why people do not go to
pharmacies anymore and venture into the informal market:

> des personnes n'hésitent plus à revendre des produits pharmaceutiques sans
> ordonnance. Selon Fara, propriétaire d'un commerce prospère ” Les
> médicaments que nous vendons sont les mêmes qu'en pharmacie, puisque je les
> achète chez un grossiste agréé. Mais comme je n'ai pas autant de charges
> qu'une pharmacie, ils sont deux fois moins chers “. Le problème des
> consommateurs est donc le prix.

Many convenience stores do not hesitate to re-sell medicines without
prescription anymore. Fara, the owner of one such successful store, says: “The
medicines that we sell are the same as the ones in pharmacies since I purchase
them from a certified distributor. But my fiscal charges are much smaller than
the pharmacies so I can sell drugs twice as cheap.” For consumers, the issue
here seem to be the cost of the medicines.

While it is important to determine the circuit of counterfeit drugs to fight
efficiently against this trafficking, many countries warn that this cannot
overshadow the need to innovate in other areas as well to fight diseases.
Henry Neondo writes for [African Science
News](http://africanscience.blogspot.com/2006/04/new-initiative-to-combat-
malaria-in.html) that malaria must be fought more effectively in Kenya,
including the search for a vaccine:

> Kenya has been selected among nine other African countries that will benefit
> from a new multi-billion shillings drive in search for an anti-malaria
