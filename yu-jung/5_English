Nahr el Bared camp, Lebanon (by Flickr user nimzilvio)

Lebanon is home to over 400,000 Palestinian refugees, some of whom were
expelled or fled in 1948 at the time of the creation of the state of Israel,
and others who fled during and after the 1967 war. These refugees are not
allowed to own property, cannot access the health care system, and need a
special permit to leave their refugee camps, restrictions which have been
criticized by groups such as [Amnesty
International](http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE18/010/2007).

Until recently, they were also barred from working in a number of professions,
however, [new legislation passed by
parliament](http://www.iloubnan.info/politics/actualite/id/49621/titre/Lebanon-
grants-Palestinian-refugees-right-to-work) on August 17 grants Palestinian
refugees the same employment rights as other foreigners (they will [still be
barred](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/24/palestinian-refugees-
lebanon-rights) from ‘self-employed’ professions, including law and medicine).

The legislation, which will take effect once President Michel Suleiman
endorses it, has been met with both applause and dissent. While some, such as
[the UN](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35667&Cr=Palest&Cr1=),
see it as a step toward bettering the lives of a long-term refugee population,
others see it as normalization of the refugee population into Lebanon, and
thus a step away toward securing the [Right of
Return](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return).

Roqayah Chamseddine, writing for _Mondoweiss_ ,
[explains](http://mondoweiss.net/2010/08/palestinian-refugees-in-lebanon-do-
not-only-have-israel-to-blame-for-their-plight.html) why, for her, the
decision is a welcome move, but not nearly enough:

> I cringe at the thought of calling the refugee camps “slums” but I must use
> candid rhetoric; The Palestinians are being subjugated – by the Israeli’s,
> the Americans and the Arabs.
>
> Now, in respect to the recent provision by the Lebanese parliament , it has
> taken 60 years for the Lebanese to allow the Palestinians the sparse right
> to work; I don’t know whether to be ashamed or slightly optimistic. It is a
> move in the right direction but surely we can all contend that it is a
> fairly apathetic crawl – in the right direction. No one should be bragging,
> especially not the Lebanese Government.

Blogger Oussama Hayek [says](http://oussama-hayek.blogspot.com/2010/08/there-
is-no-reason-to-celebrate.html) that there is “no reason to celebrate
Palestinian rights” because:

> There is something fundamentally flawed with the law that Parliament
> [passed](http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=194667) today,
> granting Palestinians the right to work in Lebanon. It stinks of continuing
> discrimination against one particular nationality. It is also absolutely the
> wrong move for two reasons:
>
> * It continues to [bar](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-17/lebanon-
> lawmakers-grant-palestinian-refugees-the-right-to-work-benefits.html)
> Palestinians from jobs that require membership in a syndicate, a medieval
> guild-like system that should be abolished for everyone.
> * It continues to bar Palestinians from [owning
> property](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hQgEbOn5jFd44coMyjIDf-
> Jt2FvQ).

The blogger concludes:

> It is true that Palestinian groups routinely violate Lebanese laws, and have
> yet to accept to
> [disarm](http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=194447). But
> holding an entire population of 400,000 hostage for the actions of a few

On the other side of the coin, Marillionlb of _For a better Lebanon_ [thinks
that](http://forabetterlebanon.blogspot.com/2010/06/my-take-on-palestinians-
civil-rights-in.html) the refugees are not Lebanon's responsibility:

> Yes every single human being has the right to a decent life, to have his
> basic rights protected, access to basic medical care, schooling, a roof over
> his head, to live with dignity, to be able to work and be a “constructive”
> part of society..etc.  
>  BUT:  
>  In order to enjoy and be given such rights a person should abide by certain
> rules, especially when he is a host in a foreign land (to say the least and
> not use the term “refugee”).  
>  The Palestinian problem was not caused by Lebanon, and it was not the
> Lebanese who deprived the Palestinians from their homeland; on the contrary,
> Lebanon (albeit forcibly) not only accepted a big influx of refugees, but
> (wrongly) signed the Cairo treaty giving Yasser Arafat and his group of
> thugs a free hand not only to cause mayhem, but also (at a certain point in
> time) try to establish the state of Palestine within the Lebanese borders.

A commenter on the blog expresses agreement:

> thank you for this post. You are 100% correct.  
>  If they want rights, maybe they should respect their host country first and
> hand over their weapons.  
>  Lebanon has suffered alot more than any country should have to because of
> the palestinians.

From the Palestinian perspective, as
[expressed](http://palestinefreevoice.blogspot.com/2010/08/no-grant-to-
palestinian-civil-rights-in.html) on _Palestine Free Voice_ , the changes are
hardly changes at all:

> Unfortunately Lebanon did not grant its Palestinian refugees meaningful
> civil rights on 8/17/10 or even significantly improve their work prospects.
> What it did do was cancel the work permit fee ( which was never a big
> problem) and allow for the setting up of a private Social Security Fund (not
> the Lebanese National Security Fund as misreported in much of the media.)

Lastly, Twitter user [iRevolt](http://twitter.com/iRevolt) sums up one popular
Palestinian perspective by explaining why equal rights–without citizenship–are
important to so many people:

> If the Palestinians are mandated civil, social and economic rights without
> being given Lebanese citizenship then it will work towards safeguarding the
> necessity of returning home, refuting US-Israeli wishes for the Palestinians
> to integrate into other parts of the Arab world – thus leaving behind their
> identities in some for or fashion – and allowing Palestinians to improve
> their status while living outside of their homeland.
