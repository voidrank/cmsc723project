The South African town of
[Grahamstown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grahamstown) in the Eastern Cape
Municipality of [Makana](http://www.makana.gov.za/), may not be hosting any of
the matches of the 2010 World Cup, but its residents are equally excited about
the upcoming tournament. During the month-long event, the city will also host
its annual [National Arts Festival](http://www.nationalartsfestival.co.za/),
as well as provide a [Public Viewing Area (PVA) at the local Miki Yili
Stadium](http://www.grahamstown.co.za/index.php?pid=62) for its residents and
other visitors.

Participants in the [Grocott's Mail's]() citizen journalism program called [My
Makana](http://www.grocotts.co.za/category/section/mymakana) have started to
write about how the World Cup will affect their country as a whole, as well as
about the impact on their local community.

One such citizen journalist, Thozamile Fana is [a bit skeptical about what the
World Cup will mean for the
country](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/how-will-you-
benefit-world-cup-26-05-2010):

> A lot of promises were made with regards to how the upcoming soccer world
> cup will benefit the South African nation. However, other than the stadiums,
> which are likely to be white elephants if the authorities do not have
> tangible plans outlining how the infrastructure will be used after the
> tournament, there seems to be little hope that the locals will benefit from
> it.

Closer to home, many of the citizen journalists wrote about these public
viewing areas, of which Grahamstown will be 1 of 6 towns in the Eastern Cape
to provide a place for people to gather and watch the games and where the
Makana Municipality has spent approximately 100,000 Rand (approximately
US$13,000) on the project. A part of the project is the invitation to local
artists to submit a proposal to perform in the PVA. However, citizen
journalist Mziyanda Bulani [notes that there has been very little information
distributed by interviewing some of these
artists](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/r100-000-spent-
public-viewing-area-24-05-2010):

> According to Mathews Nontyi, a local performing artist, the P.V.A is a waste
> of money. He argues that the event is less than 20 days away but they know
> nothing about the PVA's programme. “It is an event for only the connected
> artists and the majority of local artists will be left out of it.”

Like any big event, local organizers have had to place [restrictions on the
sale of alcohol](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/alcohol-
restrictions-makana-pva-25-05-2010), ensure that [there is enough water
available for
patrons](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/enough-water-
world-cup-patrons-25-05-2010), [provide ample
security](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/gtown-gearing-
safe-world-cup-24-05-2010), and [organize sufficient traffic
control](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/traffic-plans-
errand-motorists-ahead-wc-26-05-2010).

The timing of the World Cup that coincides with the expanded Arts Festival was
expected to provide an economic boom for the local area. Even though the
activities planned by the local organizing committee have created jobs, their
duties will end in August after the programs wraps up, [notes citizen
journalist Pumelelo
Frans](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/employment-
opportunities-during-world-cup-24-05-2010). However, these events also have
disrupted the work of others in the informal sector because more restrictions
have been placed on their operations. Frans spoke with one local resident, who
is ” worried about hawkers who have been driven off the streets in town
arguing that some of them are bread winners in their families.”

Opportunities for local volunteers was also expected to be made available,
writes citizen journalist Luvuyo Gcule. However, the local agency that was to
have recruited volunteers [had to close due to funding
difficulties](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/wc-volunteer-
programme-dire-straits-26-05-2010).

The tourism industry in Grahamstown has been preparing itself for an influx of
tourists to participate in the Arts Festival and take in the World Cup
atmosphere at the PVA. Citizen journalist Natasha Plaatjes [spoke with several
hotels in the town to find out about any change in the amount of
business](http://www.grocotts.co.za/content/mymakana/mystory/no-extra-hotel-
bookings-ahead-world-cup-20-05-2010). Some have reported that there have been
a lot of inquiries, but not an equal amount of bookings. While other hotels
like the Victoria Mews is fully booked, but the manager Dumisani Banda says
that the guests are their regular customers and unrelated to the World Cup
festivities. Banda is positive that:

> tourists will show interest in Grahamstown as it is only an hour- and-half
> from the Port Elizabeth world cup stadium. According to Banda, Grahamstown
> and the surrounding areas has a variety of facilities to offer tourists.
>
> “A public viewing area (PVA) has been set up with a big screen TV at Miki
> Yili stadium in the township,” said Makkink. The PVA is meant to create a
> world cup stadium atmosphere for those who do not to afford to buy world cup
> tickets.
