On the heels of Fidel Castro's admission (and [subsequent
retraction](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/the-
cuban-model-not-working-so-much/62904/)) that [the Cuban economic model no
longer works](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/fidel-
cuban-model-doesnt-even-work-for-us-anymore/62602/), the government [has
announced](http://yohandry.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/pronunciamiento-de-la-
central-de-trabajadores-de-cuba/) [ES] that [it intends to cut massive numbers
of state jobs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11291267), in an
effort to breathe some life into the island's struggling economy.

_[The Cuban Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2010/09/now-it-gets-
serious.html)_ says of the news:

> The headline is bland: ‘Announcement of the Central de Trabajadores de
> Cuba.’
>
> The news is huge: 500,000 layoffs by next May, with a ‘parallel an increase
> in the non-state sector.’
>
> If fully carried out, a major expansion of Cuba’s private sector will
> benefit many thousands of Cuban families and give Cuban Americans
> opportunites through remittances to help relatives in Cuba who will be
> working on their own.

_[El Cafe Cubano](http://elcubanocafe.blogspot.com/2010/09/cuba-to-axe-one-
million-state-jobs.html)_ is a bit more cynical:

> Communist Cuba announced it will cut one million state jobs and SUPPOSEDLY
> encourage small business. I wonder if it has to do with the TOTAL INEPTNESS
> of the Cuban dictatorship? Soon will will be hearing that it's those pesky
> exiles or the embargo's fault.
>
> Just wondering if some of those state jobs cut are:
>
> -Guards at jails where political prisoners are held?  
>  -maintenance of all of the castro klan? (can save MILLIONS HERE!

_[Havana Times](http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=29273)_ quotes the _Cuban
Workers Federation (CTC)_ , which describes the move as “a plan to “update”
the Cuban economic model and plans for the economy for the 2011-2015 period”,
adding:

> When the government-controlled Cuban media reports on layoffs in capitalist
> countries they are routinely described as inhumane measures to benefit the
> profitability of businesses as well as demonstrating the incapacity of the
> system to guarantee employment for all workers.
>
> Now, in presenting the massive layoff program in the local press, it is
> reported as something positive for the country’s socialist system burdened
> by a surplus of workers in the giant State sector.
>
> Those not interested will have the option of self-employment or joining
> another private initiative such as cooperatives. The details on how the self
> employment options and cooperatives will be allowed to operate have yet to
> be announced.

_[El Yuma](http://elyuma.blogspot.com/2010/09/return-of-self-employment-in-
cuba.html)_ speculates on whether the measures will herald just that – the
return of self-employment in Cuba, and _[The Cuban
Triangle](http://cubantriangle.blogspot.com/2010/09/cubas-soon-to-expand-
private-sector.html)_ , in a follow-up post, lists some keen observations:

> \- The 500,000 figure is alarming – it conjures up an image of 500,000 Cuban
> workers going home with a pink slip, not knowing where they will go the next
> morning, and of the economy suddenly needing to create 500,000 new jobs.
>
> \- Self-employment, or trabajo por cuenta propia, is another source of new
> employment. Many will surely welcome the ability to get a license so they
> can stop working in the shadows. There are many thousands of Cubans in this
> category…
>
> \- Cubans have been calling for the government to turn small state
> enterprises into cooperatives in the cities; cooperatives, after all, are a
> form of property that Cuba has allowed in the countryside for years. This
> will be interesting to watch. Conversion is easy, but profitability will
> depend on the workers and the rules under which they work.
>
> \- Last time I surveyed Cuba’s cuentapropistas, I found that those whose
> businesses operated in pesos were earning more than three times the average
> state salary. Here again, the rules will matter…

_[Havana Times](http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=29281)_ sums up the situation
this way:

> The imminent loss of jobs has raised new concerns in Cuba, but also new
> prospects, expectations and questions with regard to the expansion of
> private enterprise, as the new tax regime and guarantees for how the new
> system will function have not yet been made public.
