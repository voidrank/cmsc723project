Despite 81 million unemployed youth in the world, “Only 4.4 percent of global
income is spent on education and a fraction of that on youth unemployment,”
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown writes in an article called, “[Give The
Kids Jobs!](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/09/02/gordon-brown-
calls-crisis-of-youth-unemployment-a-global-epidemic.html)”

This can serve as good a tip-off as any as to why Chile is Chile. It spends
4.4% of its GDP on education, below what the UN suggests for developed
countries (7%), and why – as the President of the American Federation of
Teachers pointed out in a previous interview with the writer – Chile’s results
“have not been impressive — at least as measured by[
PISA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment),”
a form of international testing that puts them second from the bottom of 56
countries, cushioned only by Peru.

For the past five months, Chilean students have been actively responding to
this, which Global Voices has documented (see: [October
12th](../2011/10/12/chile-education-reform-triumphs-in-unofficial-
plebiscite/), [August 10th](../2011/08/10/chile-demonstrators-thwart-hooded-
violent-protestors/), [and more](../-/world/latin-america/chile/).) As
American media outlets begin to come to terms with Occupy Wall Street (who are
barrelling forward at a rapid clip), they can look at the texture of what’s
happening in a country where — unlike Egypt and Tunisia — there is neither a
Dictator nor an infrastructure gap, but inequality, inequality, inequality.

In a blog post for the Harvard Business Review published during the first week
of Occupy Wall Street,[ James Allworth postulated that the real choice at hand
was a choice between capitalism and
democracy](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/the_wall_street_protests_the_u.html)
and how the friction between the two would be resolved.

That friction — and that issue ([Chile’s wealth distribution ranks among the
world’s worst](http://en.mercopress.com/2004/09/30/chile-s-wealth-
distribution-among-the-world-s-worst)) — is manifesting itself within the call
for free education. As of 2009, only 27% of Chilean students who could be
enrolled in educational institutions were enrolled. No new public universities
have been built since Pinochet. Schools are funded locally, which means the
quality of the school depends on the monetary quality of the area. More
Chileans are going to Argentina for school because it’s cheaper.

The end game for the middle class can either follow one of two routes: stay
healthy and fine and avoid the idea of an end game altogether, or follow what
Elizabeth Warren has been tracking, most notably in[ _The Two-Income
Trap_](http://motherjones.com/politics/2004/11/two-income-trap).

Though income-wages have been stagnant for the past forty years in the United
States, income volatility has occurred with a ninety percent frequency for a
family with two children between 1970 and 2003.

A few things constitute income volatility — and it can be found across
borders.

In Chile, [blogger Ricardo Acuña
writes](http://vueweekly.com/front/story/issues_the_fictional_middle_class/)
that one can pay for their groceries on their credit card in installments. In
2009, [the median income was listed at 735,503
pesos](http://www.kylehepp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-
shot-2011-08-22-at-1.46.39-PM.jpg)/1,570 dollars per month.

La Polar — the fourth largest retail company in Chile — had unilaterally
renegotiated credit card arrangements with 418,000 Chileans for six years.[
The New York Times
reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/business/global/abuses-by-credit-
issuers-in-chile-and-brazil-snare-consumers.html?pagewanted=all) that “annual
interest charges can top 220 percent and consumers cannot seek bankruptcy
protection.”

The Times continues:

> … consumer debt rose by 254 percent, to roughly $34 million, between 2001
> and 2008, the debt-to-income level topped 70 percent at the end of 2010,
> according to the Central Bank.

And since there is no bankruptcy protection, Chileans have to worry about
falling on the Dicom, something which is — essentially — a credit agency for
people: if you have bad credit, you’ll be blacklisted from a job and find it
harder to get a loan.

The economic health of a middle class family matters. Eliminate economic
malfeasance and it is safer for the family and safer for the country in which
they reside. As Paul Krugman has noted, anything that inflates income
inequality — meaning: anything that shrinks the middle class by widening the
gap between the rich and the poor — could seriously provoke — and be an
indicator of –[ a financial
crisis](http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/inequality_crises.pdf). Attack
inequality and you attack risk.

Anyone familiar with the [#OWS](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23OWS)
[#needsoftheoccupiers](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23needsoftheoccupiers)
hashtags will see an instant rapport when[ Shalini Adnani walked to the
University of Chile](http://upsidedownworld.org/main/chile-
archives-34/3249-a-view-from-inside-an-occupied-chilean-school):

> A sign at the entrance urged for help: “We Need (education): Sheets, toilet
> paper, liquid soap, soap dish soap, brooms, paper towels, deodorant,
> cardboard, any games, and love.”

Adnani continues:

> But as I walked inside students welcomed me with the creativity that defined
> the student movement. A man dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow with a Jolly
> Roger flag hanging from his belt holds my chin with the tip of his cutlass
> humorously asking for identification.

In the “[Acuerdo Social por la Educación
Chilena](http://www.elciudadano.cl/2011/07/31/38923/las-bases-para-un-acuerdo-
social-por-la-educacion-chilena/),” a “Social Agreement for Chilean
Education,” which was written by the students, one paragraph reads:

> Esto implica entender la educación como una inversión social y no meramente
> individual, necesaria para la batalla contra la desigualdad y el alcance de
> la libertad y la justicia social.

This involves understanding education as a social investment and not merely an
individual investment, which is necessary for the battle against inequality
and the extent of freedom and social justice.

This past Sunday, October 8, [The New York Times
wrote](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/opinion/sunday/protesters-against-
wall-street.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss):

> At this point, protest is the message: income inequality is grinding down

[In an interview with Harald
Beyer](http://www.chascones.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2775:harald-
beyer-entrevista-a-camila-vallejos&catid=49:opinion&Itemid=68), leader of the
student movement Camila Vallejo — explaining why the students were protesting
— said, simply,

> “La democracia no se ejerce necesariamente una vez cada cuatro años en una
> urna.”

“Democracy is not necessarily exercised once every four years in an urn.”
