From October 21 to 23, 2011, Jordan hosted the World Economic Forum's (WEF)
Special Meeting on Economic Growth and Job Creation in the Arab World at the
Dead Sea. Jordan has had a long relationship with the World Economic Forum
(WEF) since the mid-1990s, and a range of projects have been associated with
the forum over the years with lots of glamor and hype.

This year as the Arab world continues to awaken and reshape its existence, a
vocal and alternative narrative is growing, taking stock of such WEF
associated projects in light of Jordan and the region's current challenges.

Over the past few days, I joined forces with an independent group of
Jordanians and we co-authored a post published on the WEF's blog titled
‘[Voices from Jordan: An Alternative
Narrative](http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2011/10/voices-from-jordan-an-
alternative-narrative.html)‘ where we question Jordan's performance and track
record with the WEF.

> Through embracing a paradigm that strips economics of its political context,

On Twitter, [Farah
Ghniem](https://twitter.com/#!/farahghniem/status/127663708129333248), asks:

> It doesn't matter that Jordan is full of people with potential. Everywhere
> is. What matters: why does the system fail them? #OccupyWEF #WEF

Urban activist, [Raghda Butros, takes
stock](https://twitter.com/#!/raghda/status/127715984034377728):

> An education initiative was launched in '03 with #WEF. Today the quality of
> education in Jordan is in sharp decline. #OccupyWEF

[Economist Ibrahim
Saif](http://twitter.com/#!/Ibrasaif/status/126367387195936768) shared his
lack of conviction:

> I am not very encouraged about the WEF and what it offers to the
> marginalized, there is a need for a new thinking. That won't come from WEF.

While attending the entrepreneurship lunch, [Dina Shoman, head of
branding](http://twitter.com/#!/DinaShoman/status/127685191329267713) at the
Arab Bank tweeted:

> 10 years of discussion on #entrepreneurship there is a failure to launch
> from regulatory and governments side #wef #jo

Her Highness [Princess Ghida
Talal](http://twitter.com/#!/GhidaTalal/status/127704025931055104),
chairperson of the King Hussein Cancer Foundation commented and couldn't
resist retweeting:

> Too funny and too true not to RT “@ThorayaER: Schwab at #WEF introducing all
> Their Excellencies. So many Excellencies, so little excellence!”

For more reactions, join the conversation on Twitter camped on the hashtags
#WEF and #OccupyWEF, and on [the WEF blog](http://www.forumblog.org).
