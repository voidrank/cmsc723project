Prison overcrowding in Cambodia is getting worse, according to a
[report](http://www.licadho-cambodia.org/reports.php?perm=154) published by
human rights group Licadho:

> Cambodia's prison population is in the midst of an unprecedented population
> boom. Just seven years ago, the 18 prisons monitored by LICADHO were at
> roughly 100% of their collective capacity. Today, they are filled to roughly
> 180% of their capacity, making Cambodia's prison system among the 25 most
> overcrowded in the world.

The group created a [map](http://www.licadho-cambodia.org/overcrowding2011/)
to highlight the locations of overcrowded prisons:

cambodia.org/overcrowding2011/)

The group discovered some of the factors which contributed to the problem of
[prison overcrowding](http://www.licadho-
cambodia.org/pressrelease.php?perm=253):

> The report also highlights three new areas of concern that LICADHO has
> documented over the past year, including: The practice of imprisoning those
> who cannot – or do not – pay their criminal fines; a pilot program in which
> pretrial inmates were transferred to a local drug detention center to reduce
> prison overcrowding; and the use of prison sentences that are
> disproportionate to the crimes for which they are imposed. The latter
> concern is supported by a handful of case studies, including one in which a
> man was sentenced to a year in prison for stealing a chicken.

Overcrowding in Preah Sihanouk Provincial Prison

[The Angkor Post](http://theangkorpost.blogspot.com/2011/07/reducing-prison-
overcrowding.html) publishes an article that suggests the implementation of
non-custodial sentences as a practical reform measure to decongest the
prisons:

> I strongly support the utilisation of all the sentencing options provided in
> the Penal Code as alternatives to incarceration. To ensure such measures are
> viable and effective, the RGC (Royal Government of Cambodia) must provide
> adequate resources to courts, police and social service providers and those
> institutions must establish clear processes and procedures for monitoring
> adherence to non-custodial sentences.
>
> Non-custodial sentences, where appropriate, provide a win-win solution to
> Cambodia’s prison overcrowding; more effective responses to petty criminal
> offending and a lower prison population.

The government has promised to draft some policy [reforms](http://ki-
media.blogspot.com/2011/08/draft-prison-law-unclear-rights-
groups.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FbmaW+%28KI+Media%29)
to improve the prison conditions. Meanwhile, it was reported that an
[abandoned
cinema](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011082951311/National-
news/inmates-caged-in-abandoned-cinema-turned-into-prison.html) has been
converted into a prison to address the overcrowding problem.

**Prison blog**

Last month, a blog allegedly written by a foreign inmate in Prey Sar prison
was widely
[discussed](http://www.khmer440.com/chat_forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=19024) in
the Cambodian cyberspace. Even mainstream media reported it. [Derek
Stout](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011080150761/National-
news/crowded-cell-inspires-blogger-to-detail-life-within-capitals-jail.html)
notes that “author’s bravado and eccentric use of language are reminiscent of
a character in an Irvine Welsh novel.”

> Prey Sar prison’s first blogger has been quick to find an eager audience in
> cyberspace, though some readers have expressed scepticism about the blog’s
> authenticity.
>
> The first post appeared last Wednesday. By the weekend it had been linked on
> Twitter and English-language internet forums in Cambodia.
>
> The blog’s author claims to be a western inmate awaiting trial at the
> notorious prison.
>
> Titled “Life in one square meter”, it details conditions inside a crowded
> Prey Sar cell. The author’s bravado and eccentric use of language are
> reminiscent of a character in an Irvine Welsh novel.

The prison blog “Life in one square meter” has been deleted already.
Fortunately, [LTO Cambodia](http://ltocambodia.blogspot.com/2011/08/prison-
blog.html) was able to save a few articles and posted it online:

> Offcourse getting this phone in here & having access to internet is the main
> essentiallity. Being able to follow life on the outside, get information and
> actively work, makes all the difference!
>
> Just finding ways to smuggle illegal devices such as this, is a challenge &
> takes alot of effort. Trial and error, loss of cash and time is all a part
> of it.
>
> The first weeks I was very sick, couldnt eat and was hungry and exhausted
> most of the time. Several attempts to get to the hospital when the NGOs are
> here, which turned out to be a big nothing. They are just as useless as the
> “doctor” in here.
>
> My cellmates managed to get me to the hospital, where they put drip and then
> tossed me off at a bunk in one of the hospital-cells.
>
> In there the prisoners are the doctors and luckily I was well taken care of,
> by ine of the inmates, who obviously had seen alot in there.
