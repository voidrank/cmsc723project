A smear campaign against Taiwanese scholar Huang Kuo-chang by [Want Want China
Time's](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/旺旺中時媒體集團) (WWCT) [zh] media outlets, in
reaction to his opposition of the group's [acquisition of a television cable
network](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/30/taiwan-threat-of-media-
monopoly-and-power-abuse) back in July 2012, has triggered intense public
outrage in Taiwan.

More than 9,000 students and journalists demonstrated together against media
monopoly on September 1. The mobilization is the largest addressing media
reform in Taiwanese history.

**Smear campaign**

In addition to the controversy over the cable network acquisition, many
scholars have also questioned WWCT owner [Tsai Eng-
Meng](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tycoon-prods-taiwan-closer-to-
china/2012/01/20/gIQAhswmFQ_story.html)‘s
[style](https://sites.google.com/site/occupyncc/1-zui-xin-xing-
dong/explanation/q7) in running media organizations; he has made public claims
that “the [June 4
Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989)
reports are [incorrect](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tycoon-prods-
taiwan-closer-to-china/2012/01/20/gIQAhswmFQ_story.html)“, fired the chief
editor [of China Times] [who was critical of Communist China government
officials](http://labor.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?q=node/185) [zh], and [sells
column inches](http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2010/new/nov/12/today-p1.htm) in
his media outlets to the mainland Chinese government.

Media smear sparks largest media reform campaign in Taiwanese history. Photos
taken by You Hai-xiang from vita.tw

On July 25, when NCC was reviewing the WWCT application, Huang Kuo-chang –
among a dozen other scholars – protested outside its offices demanding they to
turn down the application. They left at 10:30am but at 3pm a group of so-
called students with masks on their faces, arrived at Taiwan media regulator
the National Communications Commission (NCC) to also protest.

WWCT photographers took some photos showing a woman distributing money to the
protest “students”. The photos were published the next day, in the Times
Weekly's [front page story](http://mag.chinatimes.com/mag-single-
idx.aspx?magid=75&perid=2591) [zh], ‘Huang Kuo-chang headed anti-Want Want
China Times protest, the demonstrators were paid. With whose money?’.

All major WWCT media outlets then opened fire at Huang. Even though Huang Kuo-
chang clarified the situation in a [press
conference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAB0oMFhWKY) [zh] and the woman who
distributed the money also
[confirmed](http://www.nownews.com/2012/07/29/138-2839252.htm) [zh] that Huang
did not paid the students, WWCT's six media outlets continued [smearing
Huang](http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/property/20120728/34400563)
[zh] in the news, editorials and talk shows.

A netizen with sharp eyes found out that the Deputy Chief of Times Weekly, Lin
Chao-xin, was [among the “student”
protestors](http://blog.udn.com/amisgin/6679647) [zh] and distributed a
screenshot online, which was reposted by a student from National Tsinghua
Universy, Chen Wei-ting, with a question asking if WWCT were directing the
protest behind the scenes.

WWCT's TV outlet revealed Chen's personal details to the public and accused
him of [creating fake evidence against Lin Chao-
xin](http://tv.fanswong.com/movie-7201-0730%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E9%BE%8D%E6%8D%B2%E9%A2%A8%E3%80%80%E6%99%82%E5%91%A8%E5%89%AF%E7%B8%BD%E6%9E%97%E6%9C%9D%E9%91%AB%E7%8F%BE%E5%A0%B4%E6%8E%A1%E8%A8%AA%20%E8%A2%AB%E7%B6%B2%E5%8F%8B%E6%83%A1%E6%84%8F%E6%8A%B9%E9%BB%91%E6%A0%BD%E8%B4%93.html)

**Online mobilization against media giant**

The [Youth Coalition Against Media
Giant](https://www.facebook.com/idontwantwant) [zh] was set up by students
from 28 universities and it organized a
[demonstration](https://www.facebook.com/events/372427069489158) against WWCT
on July 31. Even though [Typhoon
Saola](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-07/31/c_131749867.htm) was
approaching on that day, around [700 students showed up outside the
headquarter of WWTC](http://www.nexttv.com.tw/news/realtime/politics/10342250)
with slogans – “[unprofessional media, go back to the food
industry](http://pots.tw/node/10922) [zh]”, “defend news freedom against media
giants”, “defend freedom of speech against chilling effect”.

Yet, among seven cable TV news channel, [four of them ignored the
news](http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20120801/34408560).
Journalism scholar Benla Kuang

Within WWCT, there is some dissent. The Deputy Chief Editor of China Times, Ho
Jungshin, [revealed in his
blog](http://blog.chinatimes.com/turtle/archive/2012/08/12/2460532.html) [zh]:

>
> 為了爭取專業自主，我和部分中時同事（包括部分中時高層）乃至幾位關心中時發展人士都做了很多努力⋯⋯由於上述體制內改革行動已產生後座力，為了避免波及同事，我立即送出書面辭呈。

> In order to strive for professional independence, a number of colleague
> including myself have tried very hard… But there is some backfiring and in
> order to prevent other colleagues from taking the consequences, I have
> submitted my resignation letter.

Ho is the founding chairperson of the Taiwan Journalist Association. His
resignation indicates the failure of internal reforms and a number of
journalists [followed his move](http://newtalk.tw/news_read.php?oid=28231)
[zh]. Another China Times journalist who resigned, You Wan-chi,
[published](http://cherryaki66.blogspot.tw/2012/08/blog-post_31.html) [zh] her
diary online:

>
> 今天我選擇離開，主因除了黃國昌走路工狠狠踩到我紅線外，我進中時才一年多，當我對這份報社的失望大過於期待、情感大過於傷害，即使薪水可以就此多十倍，說真的，我依然找不到半點理由，足以說服自己留下來。

> Today I choose to leave mainly because the way how they smeared Huang Guo-
> chang has crossed my line. I worked in China Times for more than one year,
> the disappointment and emotional stress has been excessive. Even though the
> salary is a dozen more times higher than other media outlets, I could not
> find any reason for me to stay.

**September 1 anti-media monopoly protest**

Parent groups launched a petition against media bullying of students,’[Family
members united against the hegemony of Want Want China
Times](https://www.facebook.com/events/492688487411626/) [zh]’. Journalist
students co-signed a statement that they will [refuse
working](http://www.coolloud.org.tw/node/70093) for Want Want China Times. The
[Youth Coalition Against Media Giant](https://www.facebook.com/idontwantwant)
urged consumers [stop buying from Want
Want](https://www.facebook.com/events/226041374185577) and the Taiwan
Journalist Association called for a protest against media monopoly on
September 1.

More than [9,000 people joined](http://newtalk.tw/news_read.php?oid=28912) the
September 1 rally. The protestors are mainly media workers, students and
members of civic groups. They demonstrated outside the headquarter of the WWCT
and rallied to NCC [demanding](http://www.coolloud.org.tw/node/70346) Tsai
Eng-ming to resign from all media management position. They also called for
professional journalistic practice and an anti-media monopoly law. This is the
biggest media reform demonstration in Taiwanese history.

Professor Chang Jin-hua from the Center of Journalism and Communication,
National Taiwan University
[stressed](http://shuchuan7.blogspot.tw/2012/09/blog-post.html) [zh]:

>
> 我們要大聲要求NCC要維護民主多元，要保障專業自主權，要悍衛新聞自由，你們不是財團的工具，不是黨政高層的白手套。有線電視集中度愈來愈高，損傷新聞自由、記者工作權，NCC未提出有效對策，縱容業者坐大，NCC應儘快制定反媒體壟斷法。

> We demand NCC to defend a democracy that protect diversity, journalistic

Yet after the September 1 protest, the NCC still refused to
[change](http://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%97%BA%E4%B8%AD%E4%BD%B5%E8%B3%BC%E6%A1%88-ncc%E6%9C%89%E6%A2%9D%E4%BB%B6%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-020513770.html)
in its decision on WWCT's acquisition of China Network System. The flames of
fury continue to spread.
