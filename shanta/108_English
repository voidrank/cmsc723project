_Kopach_ , a columnist for the independent portal _Okno.mk_ , [published a
list](http://www.okno.mk/node/6086) [MKD] entitled “10 Ways to Run a [Banana
State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic).”

The author, whose pseudonym means “Digger” in Macedonian, wrote that he was
inspired by and used the books _Year 501: The Conquest Continues_ by [Noam
Chomsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) and _Homo
Postcommunisticus_ by Mikloš Biro ([a
review](http://www.danas.rs/dodaci/vikend/miklos_biro_homo_postcommunisticus.26.html?news_id=107690)
in Serbian), and the essay _[Eternal
Fascism](http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_blackshirt.html)_ by Umberto
Eco.

The link to the list was widely distributed and discussed on Facebook and
Twitter, and via other local media, such as coffee and beer.

> **Step 1: Treat them as monkeys**
>
> The first and basic precondition in order to start any kind of discussion
> about running a banana state is to constantly make monkeys out of the
> citizens. There are different ways to go about it, but in practice it all
> boils down to treating the people as incompetent, inert and passive rabble,
> until it becomes just that: passive and inert rabble, interested only in its
> own belly. You have to put the masses in a corner and teach them that it is
> their place, making them pleased with that condition, because they are free
> of all social responsibilities.
>
> **Step 2: Determine the leaders**
>
> We know from history that even the
> [Cossacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks) choose their leaders
> through democratic elections: the elders would elect a leader called
> [Ataman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataman) at a plenary session (it
> sounds like a Hollywood movie, doesn't it?). This democratic legitimacy did
> not hinder the Ataman to practice his right to cut off the heads of members
> of his tribe as he saw fit during his reign. Similarly, in a banana state
> everything must revolve around the Leader, or the Leaders, because it is
> impossible to put everybody into one political tribe. The Leader is elevated
> above the others and demands awe.
>
> **Step 3: Destroy their self-confidence**
>
> The masses must have no self-confidence, self-respect or opportunities for
> self-realization. Simply put, they must not be able to do anything on their
> own. Working at one's own initiative can lead to understanding that one can
> achieve something without the leaders, and realize one's own abilities. The
> masses must not develop self-respect in regard to the concept of determining
> their own fate through honest labor. Everything, literally everything, must
> be given or delegated to the masses: jobs, awards, kick-backs, permits,
> concessions, tenders, and university degrees. There must be no exceptions in
> the distribution of societal benefits based on fair procedures or merit,
> outside of personal judgment and personal control of the Leaders.
>
> **Step 4: Give them candy**
>
> Part of this strategy for running a banana state is to refer to the masses
> as “gentlemen” (or
> brothers/sisters/[comrades](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/04/the-
> balkans-similarities-between-facebook-and-communist-party-of-yugoslavia/)…)
> and at the same time to stuff them into a pen whenever you like. The
> approach of the rider that gives some sugar to his mount should be applied,
> to buy the obedience and affection. Afterwards there are no questions
> regarding the actual riding and conducting.
>
> **Step 5: Divide them**
>
> The basic precondition to running a banana state is dividing the masses,
> weakening them by antagonizing them against each other. Another important
> benefit of this approach is the control of the masses’ attention. If you
> generate problems in the country in a conscious and planned manner, you gain
> several advantageous elements:
>
>   * you can put the large problems – which require larger effort to solve –
> in the background
>   * you can dictate the public agenda and what others will think and argue
> about
>   * you can solve the problems you create in a manner that suits you
>   * if you create a problem, and then withdraw from the issue, it looks like
> you have given something, while in fact you just maintain the status quo and
> buy time to do something else, which is far more important to you.
>

>
> **Step 6: Force grandiose ventures**
>
> In the past, the grandiose
> [pharaohnic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh) ventures had the goal to
> ensure eternity and permanent trace in the collective memory for the
> leaders. Even though one should not underestimate the act of marking history
> with a personal stamp, an important dimension of grandiose ventures
> (projects, [buildings](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/06/macedonia-
> online-rebellion-against-skopje-2014-plan/), campaigns, events,
> construction, etc.) today is increasing the influx of means, money and other
> resources, and creating a range of opportunities to allocate them and
> distribute them as you see appropriate. Increased flow of resources makes it
> easier to direct them where you wish. Alongside other effects, this dynamism
> of money enables you to estimate where, to whom and how much to give,
> attaching the recipients to you.
>
> Two parallel processes are taking place here:
>
>   * opportunities for acquisition of a portion of the funds
>   * “legal” corruption or “recruitment” of supporters.
>

>
> **Step 7: Spread fear in measured doses**
>
> In order to develop awe among the masses, you must gradually plant
> controlled doses of fear into them. The way to do this is through selective
> presentation and propagation of fear-inducing scenes and events. The most
> frequent method to do this is showing how your opponents and unlike-minded
> individuals end up. A subtler method is excessive or overdosed use of force
> while dealing with small-fry opponents, criminals or suspects. Demonstrate
> force on the weaker to achieve an effect of awe, combined with subconscious
> submission and passivity.
>
> **Step 8: Force irrationality**
>
> The popular term for this is driving them mad. Embedding irrationality into
> public life has the function to push out rationality that should clarify
> reality. The more the citizens drown in irrationality, affects, atavisms,
> instincts, and passions, the easier it gets for you, and the harder for them
> to come up with proper solutions, to differentiate the real from fiction,
> the existing from the imagined, truth from falsehood. You drive people mad
> by a simple performance of illogical acts, against reason, logic or
> realistic assessments. When irrationality becomes the principal norm instead
> of an exception, the games called manipulation may begin.
>
> **Step 9: Determine and name the enemies**
>
> To maintain your position of untouchable and undeniable leader you must
> transform the fear into different forms and spread it in various places. One
> of the ways to do it is to directly and clearly name “enemies,” “traitors,”
> and “opponents,” who threaten with some unbelievable radical change, act or
> deeds which can turn your world upside down, and soil something that you
> hold dear and sacred. To become a superhero you need an antagonist: for
> every Batman there is a Joker, every Superman has his [Lex
> Luthor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Luthor), and every [Martin
> Mystery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Myst%C3%A8re) has his “Man in
> Black” [not the Will Smith kind], and so on. You need to combine this with
> forcing and circulating an atmosphere of conspiracy and angst through
> “spreading fear in doses” (7), making _you_ the savior from the labeled
> enemies.
>
> **Step 10: Incite rituals**
>
> Rituals remain one of the most powerful practices of spontaneous spreading
> of the power from the top. During the ex-Yugoslav era, the Communists
> perfected this through various rallies, [youth work
> actions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_work_actions),
> [relays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_of_Youth), parades and the like.
> There are numerous ways how this can be passed in pluralistic societies:
> from politicization of religious rituals, various “bene-volent” actions,
> politicization of sports events, and other things along those lines.
