Mike [shares](http://centralamericanpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-
genocide-video-about-guatemala.html) Spanish-language documentary “Our Voice,
Our Memory: The genocide in Guatemala,” which is available[ in full on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5-JZPSGnCo&feature=player_embedded#!).
He adds: “The documentary […] uses survivor and expert testimony to explain
the concept of genocide, demonstrating how the atrocities committed by the
Guatemalan military against indigenous Maya communities satisfy the
requirements of the [international legal definition of
genocide](http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html).”
