Ben from [_The Latin
Americanist_](http://ourlatinamerica.blogspot.com/2010/12/bolivia-against-

Cancun as the only country that opposed the summit's declaration. Why? Bolivia
felt the declaration didn't go far enough to curb greenhouse gas emissions or
to support the renewal of the Kyoto Protocol before it expires next year.”
