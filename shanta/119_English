Each year on March 24, the people of El Salvador and around the world
commemorate the life of Roman Catholic [Archbishop Oscar
Romero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Romero), who was assassinated by
hitmen as he celebrated mass in a chapel of a San Salvador hospital. It is
believed that he was targeted for his outspoken beliefs against the repressive
Salvadoran government that had been committing human rights abuses during the
[Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_civil_war) that had been
occurring.

Traditionally, March has been the month where events are held to honor Romero,
and the year 2010 is extra special because it marks the 30th anniversary of
the murder. Carlos X. Colorado posts a guide on _Tim's El Salvador Blog_ for
[what to expect during the
celebrations](http://luterano.blogspot.com/2010/03/guide-to-30th-anniversary-
celebrations.html), including a possible statement from the Vatican, which
could provide a clue as to the current state of the
[beatification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatification) process. He also
adds that this celebration is unique because:

> Thirty will be the largest round-number yet associated with a Romero
> anniversary, and the rise to power of the Left, with a President (Mauricio
> Funes) who openly touts Romero as his moral guide, raise a lot of
> expectations about the magnitude of this year's event.

However, another piece of news is attracting the attention of Salvadoran
bloggers. One of the assassination plotters, Álvaro Rafael Saravia, a former
officer in the Salvadoran Armed Forces [was interviewed by the online magazine
El Faro [es]](http://www.elfaro.net/es/201003/noticias/1403/). In the
interview, Saravia revealed more details of the murder. Even though Saravia
did not provide new information, as pointed out by Reyzope of the blog _El
Trompudo [es]_ , [the interview was interesting because Saravia implicated
with names those that had been
involved](http://pijazo.blogspot.com/2010/03/saravia-sobre-el-asesinato-de-
monsenor.html). Much of the information had been uncovered from unclassified
documents and from investigations conducted by Truth Commissions. However, now
there are firsthand public statements from individuals involved with the
killing:

> lo nuevo en todo esto es que uno de los participantes del asesinato,
> Saravia, incrimina a sus complices, a todo un grupo de personalidades
> públicas en este asesinato. Sus cómplices indirectos, gente que aún tiene
> participación en la cosa política y económica, […] Entonces, estos ya no son
> simples rumores, y las declaraciones pueden ser utilizadas como prueba en
> una eventual investigación y juicio que se inicie, si se quiere, para
> deducir responsables.

What is new about all this is that one of the participants in the
assassination, Saravia, incriminates his accomplices, above all a group of
public figures in this murder. His indirect accomplices are people who still
are participating in politics and in the economic area […] Now, these are not
just rumors, the statements can be used as proof for an eventual investigation
and trial if they want, in order to deduce those responsible.

subtitles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFvyhk3HACw):

Some bloggers take the opportunity to posts poems about Romero, such as [this
one [es]](http://pijazo.blogspot.com/2010/03/la-imagen-de-msr-romero.html)
from Chichipate Canaverales and [this poem
[es]](http://surasway.blogspot.com/2010/03/monsenor-romero-oscar-nuestro-
hermano.html) written by “Mariposa” on Sura's Blog.

One blogger, Raúl Fuentes of the blog _Hunnapuh [es]_ was just 11 years-old
when Romero was murdered, but he recalls his firsthand contact with Romero,
when Fuentes was a member of a Children's Choir in the community of Santiago
de Maria in the Department of
[Usulután](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usulutan), where Romero was serving as
Bishop of that diocese. Fuentes recalls, “The image that I have of (Romero) is
that he was a very humble and joyful person, and he was always in a good
mood.” Yet, [he writes about what he remembers about that night on March 24,
1980 [es]](http://hunna.org/el-monsenor-romero-que-yo-conoci/):

> Cuando a los 11 años en una noche de marzo por eso de las 8 de la noche
> dieron la noticia en la radio de que lo habian asesinado, senti un estupor,
> casi no lo podia creer pero ya a esa edad sabia que matar en El Salvador de
> esa epoca era cosa de todos los dias.

When I was 11 years-old on a March night at around 8 at night, I heard the
news on the radio that (Romero) was murdered, I was in a stupor, I could not
believe it, but even at that age, I knew that killing in El Salvador during
that time was an everyday occurrence.

As time passes on, many people remember Romero from what they are taught in
school and stories passed on to them by their parents and grandparents. His
legacy has motivated Salvadorans to follow his example, as Pocote posts
[thoughts on what Romero means to Salvadorans [es]](http://el-
salvador.blogspot.com/2010/03/monsenor-romero-en-la-historia.html):

> A monseñor Oscar Arnulfo Romero le debemos los salvadoreños, los amantes de
> la justicia, de la solidaridad, de la paz social y del bien común, un fervor
> esencial y el ejemplo constante de una actitud: si renovó la palabra, el
> mensaje de la voz para los sin voz, el cumplir exactamente con el testimonio
> cristiano, no fue menos por su compromiso genuino con los humildes y
> desheredados que por su limpieza de ánimo, su generosidad y su
> desprendimiento. Los adjetivos no sobran: monseñor Romero fue un sacerdote
> bueno, tanto como el marquesote y un profeta excepcional.
>
> Con el magnicidio de Monseñor Oscar Arnulfo Romero, todos los salvadoreños
> perdimos algo. Su desaparición física nos concierne y nos compromete: el fue
> un profeta, honrado, humilde, inteligente, talentoso y cordial.

We Salvadorans, lovers of justice, solidarity, social peace, and the common
good, owe Monsignor Oscar Arnulfo Romero an essential fervor and constant
example of an attitude: he renewed the word, the message of being a voice for
the voiceless, of being a Christian witness. He was no less for his genuine
commitment to the poor and less privileged, than for his pure in spirit, his
generosity and his selflessness. There are not enough adjectives to describe
him: Monsignor Romero was a good priest and an exceptional prophet.

With the assassination of Monsignor Oscar Arnulfo Romero, all Salvadorans lost
something. His physical disappearance concerns us and commits us: he was a
prophet, honest, humble, intelligent, talented, and friendly.
