[Bono's (U2) visit to
Russia](http://www.russiablog.org/2010/08/medvedev_and_bono_meet_in_sochi-
russia.php) [EN] turned out to be a highly politicized event. Some
[complain](http://avmalgin.livejournal.com/2076365.html) [RUS], Bono didn't
tell Medvedev about the Khimki Forest Park, some admire his [joint
performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-67iJMNfKrM&feature=player_embedded)
[RUS/EN] with Yuri Shevchuk, an opposition musician. Oleg Kozyrev
[asks](http://oleg-kozyrev.livejournal.com/3028241.html) [RUS], “What if Bono
could spend part of his energy to support the opposition?”
