Dina Fainberg of _The Dustbin of History_
[writes](http://dinafainberg.com/2011/05/watching-my-perestroika-in-london/)
about [_My Perestroika_](http://myperestroika.com/) – “a lovely documentary by
an American film-maker [[Robin
Hessman](http://filmmakerscollab.org/filmmakers/robin-hessman/)] about how
four classmates were affected by the changes in Russia from Brezhnev to Putin”
– and the Q&A that followed the film's screening in London.
