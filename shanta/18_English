In [_Pires Mios_](http://piresmios.blogspot.com/2011/05/yo-lei-este-libro-
uy.html) [es], Macarena announces that the initiative ‘I read this book’ (in
Spanish: “yo leí este libro”) that began in Argentina is now being implemented
in Uruguay. [On its official blog](http://yoleiestelibro-uy.blogspot.com/)
[es], the organizers explain how it works: you leave a book on the street (in
a bench, for example), someone finds it, reads it, and then leaves it
somewhere else for someone else to pick up and enjoy.
