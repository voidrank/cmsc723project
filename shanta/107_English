Over 1500 [people](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/news/pakistan/06-pakistan-army-to-donate-salaries-to-flood-
victims-rs-01) have lost their live in the recent episode of torrential rains
resulting in floods in various areas of Pakistan. Thousands have become
homeless and many more are fleeing fearing hunger and death. According to the
United Nations estimates [over 4 million
people](http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/asia/UN-Estimates-More-
Than-4-Million-People-Affected-By-Pakistan-Floods-100032214.html) have been
effected by the recent disaster. While heavy [floods have wrecked
havoc](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/03/flood-wrecks-havoc-in-
pakistan/) in the northern areas of the country, target killing and ethnic
clashes continue to haunt the metropolitan hub, Karachi. At least 62
[people](http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-
library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/12-four+shot+dead+in+karachi+target+killing
--bi-02) have lost their lives, in three-days of violence following the
assassination of a politician. The grief turned in to fury as the President
[embarked on a foreign trip](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10847801) despite
the abysmal conditions in the country and overlooking staunch opposition.

Many on twitter, including politicians, have joined in to criticize
President's Europe Trip:

Needless to say Pakistan is going through a critical phase. With death toll
mounting everyday the need for better [disaster
management](http://asiancorrespondent.com/sanasaleem1/pakistan-abysmal-state-
of-disaster-management-drowning-burning-&-bleeding) strategy becomes crucial,
may it be natural disasters or civil unrest. However, with the President being
indifferent to the worsening situation, getting the situation under control
has become tougher.

In a [post](http://naveenaqvi.com/2010/08/04/a-time-for-governance/) titled “A
Time For Governance” _Naveen Naqvi_ emphasized on the importance of
governance, with a tinge of anger:

> The financial capital of Pakistan is made a ghost town with deserted
> streets, business at a standstill, and petrol pumps, offices and shops
> closed. It is not as though we could not have predicted the flare up of
> tension. After all, the target killings of MQM and ANP activists or the
> armed conflict between Muhajirs and Pathans has been continuing unchecked
> for a few months now (..) Where most Pakistanis have been complaining about
> the long wait for governance, here is yet another opportunity missed. An
> increasing number of people are questioning the sincerity of an already
> unpopular leader, Asif Ali Zardari. Why would the President cancel his visit
> to Europe? Why would he stay with his people at their hour of need and
> weather the storm with them? The answer that seems to come most readily is
> that he does not care.

_Kalsoom Lakhani_ at _CHUP_
[reiterates](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/turning-grief-
into-action/) the anger and frustration at the President:

> Given this enormous devastation, [as well as the wave of targeted killings
> in Karachi that have killed 47 people after the assassination of MQM's Raza
> Haider], it is no bloody wonder that the country is pissed off at President
> Asif Ali Zardari, who is off on a jaunt around Europe while Pakistan is
> drowning. Regardless whether Zardari is needed to make decisions related to
> disaster relief or he is merely a figurehead, the decision to press forward
> with his tour comes across as callous and disconnected, and does not bode
> well for his already dismal popularity ratings.

Towards the end of her post _Kalsoom_ makes a very valid point:

> While this is certainly a time to be angry at our leadership, or lack
> thereof, it’s also a time to concentrate our energy towards helping the many
> people in need.

Perhaps what Pakistan needs the most now is to concentrate on helping those
that have been effected by the floods and focus on the need to control the
growing civic unrest. The title of Kalsoom's post is most apt – Pakistan needs
to [turn it's grief into
action](http://changinguppakistan.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/turning-grief-into-
action/).
