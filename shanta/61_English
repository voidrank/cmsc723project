[Aymara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language) is a Native American
language and one of the official languages of Peru and Bolivia. There are
roughly two million Aymara speakers in Bolivia and almost three million in
total in South America. Members of Rising Voices grantee [Voces
Bolivianas](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/voces-bolivianas/)
realized that in internet there are less materials available in their mother
tongue Aymara. [Ruben Hilary](http://lenguasycomunicacion.blogspot.com/), with
[some local volunteers](http://www.jaqi-aru.org/?page_id=20&lang=en) of El
Alto, Bolivia, established the virtual community _Jaqi Aru_. The goal of the
[Jaqi Aru](http://www.jaqi-aru.org/?lang=en) website is highlighting and
spreading Aymara language in internet through creation of digital media
contents, which involves translation, use of multimedia and social media
tools.

Aymara has gradually lost speakers both to Spanish and to Quechua in the past
century and many Aymara speakers now speak
[Quechua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua), another South American native
language. _Mario Duran_ [notes an interesting
fact](http://bolivianueva.blogspot.com/2010/07/aymaras-globales.html):

> Bolivia and Peru have the highest Aymara-speaking population, but Chile,
> with a a lot smaller Aymara-speaking population has a greater number of web
> pages in Aymara.

So why is it worth learning Aymara and posting contents online? _Sentir
Bolivia_ [writes](http://www.sentirbolivia.com/2010/08/aymara-en-el-
internet.html) [es]:

> There is much interest, both by Bolivian locals and diaspora. We want to
> show that the Aymara language is more alive than ever, which lives in the
> hearts of our people. That is not a dead language, it is appropriate and in
> constant motion.

_Ruben Hilary_ of _Jaqi Aru_ and Voces Bolivianas has also started the [Aymara
translation page of Global Voices](https://ay.globalvoicesonline.org/). In the
[Global Voices Citizen Media Summit 2010 in
Chile](https://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org/) last May, Ruben Hilary
discussed about the Jaqi Aru project in a session titled “Indigenous languages
online – challenges and opportunities”. Here is an excerpt from the [session
note](https://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/06/session-notes-
indigenous-languages-online-challenges-and-opportunities/) by Eduardo Avila:

> The goal of the Jaqi Aru project is to increase the presence of Aymara on
> the internet through 5 main activities, one of which is translations for the
> Lingua project site [Global Voices in
> Aymara](https://aym.globalvoicesonline.org/). Volunteers have been
> translating articles from [Global Voices in
> Spanish](https://es.globalvoicesonline.org/) for the past 7 months. In
> addition, the group has a collective blog site, uses web 2.0 tools like
> Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube, has been learning to subtitle videos on the
> platform DotSub, and has been starting to participate in the [Wikipedia in
> Aymara](http://ay.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayriri_u%C3%B1stawi) community.
>
> This is important for young people and when they look for information. They
> don't find a lot of information in Aymara and to make it available online.
> In addition, working with Wikipedia in Aymara may make it easier for people
> in the rural parts of the country access information in their own language
> through the use of offline capabilities. [..]
>
> _Q. What are the Aymara young people writing about?_
>
> Most of the members of the Jaqi Aru project live in the city of El Alto,
> which is a city comprised of migrants from the Altiplano. Some have moved to
> the city as young adults, others as children, and still others were born in
> the city. However, everyone has relatives in their communities of origin.
> Often they return home for festivities or to visit relatives, and they often
> write about their communities. There are some amazing pictures taken by some
> of the members that tourists or other Bolivians do not have access to, and
> that is reflected in the group blog.
