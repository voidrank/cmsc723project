If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it matter if
it made a sound or not when the tree was doing its own thing? Blogger Mojix
ponders mountains, morals, and messages in a Japanese post titled “[Is it
wrong to climb Mount Fuji empty-handed?](http://mojix.org/2010/07/05/tebura-
fujisan)“.

> July 2nd, 21:45 – A man called the police from the Eight Station on Mount
> Fuji [altitude: 3,250 meters], saying “I’m climbing Mount Fuji but didn’t
> come with a flashlight. It’s too dark to see the road and I’m scared. Please
> help me”.

> Six mountain rescue workers from the Fujinomiya Precinct of Shizuoka
> Prefecture Police headed out around 23:30 and rescued the man who had
> climbed down to the Sixth Station [altitude: 2,490 meters] by himself. The
> man had no injuries. According to the Precinct, he is a 22 year old pachinko
> parlor worker from Nakano Ward in Tokyo. He had started climbing Mount Fuji
> from the Fifth Station on the Fujinomiya Course around 17:00. Upon reaching
> the Ninth Station [altitude: 3,460 meters], he gave up and began to descend
> before calling for help with his cell phone when it became dark.
>
> The man was wearing a long sleeved shirt, jeans, and sneakers. He was empty-
> handed; he wasn’t carrying any food or equipment. The climbing season for
> Mount Fuji started on July 1st but the temperature around the Sixth Station
> is 2 degrees Celcius. The man had no climbing experience and was apologetic,
> saying “I started climbing on a whim”. The Precinct stated, “One wrong step

> come fully prepared, even for summer mountains.”

Mojix goes on to explain his viewpoint after the excerpt.

> To an experienced climber, attempting Mount Fuji without any gear is
> ridiculous. They might say, “Don’t underestimate mountain climbing!”. Be it
> Mount Fuji or the South Pole however, I think that the decision is
> fundamentally one that should be left to the individual.
>
> I bet there are lots of folks that climb Mount Fuji empty-handed. It becomes
> newsworthy like this when an incident occurs but many people probably return
> unharmed. Perhaps they even come back thinking, “Oh, that was much easier
> because I wasn’t carrying anything”.
>
> Now, the problem is when a person gets lost or almost dies. They then
> require rescue, which incurs a cost to society in general. Even if a rescue
> attempt isn’t made and they perish, a dead body can’t just be left up in the
> mountains. It's a burden either way and society foots the bill.
>
> The issue isn’t about climbing Mount Fuji without equipment. It’s about “not
> being able to take full responsibility of one’s actions” and “causing
> problems to society” when something happens.
>
> On the other hand, if a person can take full responsibility and not cause
> problems, nothing should be prohibited, not even the most foolish
> undertaking.
>
> The rescued man was purposely described as being “a 22 year old
> [pachinko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko) parlor worker from Nakano
> Ward”. The description of his outfit with the comment “not carrying neither
> food nor equipment” leaves the reader with the impression that he is a
> carefree, perhaps even reckless, fellow. Think about it, though! People will
> get lost when they get lost and die when they die… even powerful executives
> and high level bureaucrats, and even in full gear. In fact, it could be said
> that an experienced person might be more at risk because of false
> confidence.
>
> What it boils down to is that this type of article is one form of “public
> service announcement”. If more people start climbing Mount Fuji without the
> proper equipment, the chance of trouble increases and the cost of rescue
> missions starts to pile up. So, they tell us to be properly equipped when
> climbing Mount Fuji. It’s like those [Moral Education
> classes](”http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/hakusho/html/hpae199401/hpae199401_2_075.html”)
> in elementary school, but all throughout the year and utilizing the mass
> media.
>
> A prohibition to climb Mount Fuji without equipment doesn’t really affect
> our freedom. However, the influence is more widespread when the topic is
> restriction on [Konjac jelly](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-
> bin/nn20081009a3.html) manufacturing, selling [medicine
> online](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20090411a1.html), hiring
> [temp workers](http://www.japantoday.com/category/business/view/japan-to-
> ban-in-principle-temp-workers-in-manufacturing), or [terminating employment
> contracts](http://www.law.com/jsp/law/international/LawArticleIntl.jsp?id=1202433473066).
> The government’s position is usually to promote stricter restrictions for
> these kinds of topics. Therefore, any news with a “public service
> announcement” flavor takes the angle of “Disasters occur because there are
> no restrictions in place. If we make rules, we can prevent these disasters.”
> The disadvantages, cost, or unfairness that would arise from such rules do
> not receive any mention.
>
> While there’s no denying that the man took a foolhardy action, making a
> point of mentioning that he was “a 22 year old pachinko parlor worker” gives
> off the air of a carefully designed public service announcement. Had the man
> been an executive or high ranking bureaucrat, I very much doubt that this
> would have hit the news at all.
