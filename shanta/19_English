Luis Ramos in[ _Citizen of La Paz_
](http://citizenlapaz.blogspot.com/2011/05/la-virgen-mas-grande-del-mundo-y-
el.html)[es] writes about two projects in Bolivia to build “the largest
religious statue in the world” and asks: “can religious images alone promote
tourism?” He argues that before building “cement idols” Bolivia should focus
on creating adequate conditions for tourists to visit cities where they can
find these and other attractions.
