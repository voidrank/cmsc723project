The conflict between the Roma and the Hungarian community of Gyöngyöspata, a
[village north of Budapest](http://www.gyongyospata.hu/english/), escalated
drastically when paramilitary organizations appeared in the settlement some
two weeks ago, after the far-right Hungarian political party's
[rally](http://www.politics.hu/20110307/nationalist-party-stages-prohungarian-
demo).

In February, a right-wing news site _Barikád.hu_ published [an article with a
video](http://www.barikad.hu/barik%C3%A1dtv_%E2%80%9Ecig%C3%A1nyterror%E2%80%9D_%E2%80%93_heves_megye_polg%C3%A1rh%C3%A1bor%C3%BA_sz%C3%A9l%C3%A9n_%C3%A1ll-20110225_0)
(HUN) about Gyöngyöspata. The article was titled _“Tzigane terror”–Heves
county on the verge of civil war_ and reflected the problems of the village.
Namely, the fear the Hungarian residents felt because of the crimes committed
by members of the local Roma community. The reporters in the video told the
majority inhabitants of Gyöngyöspata that “if it was needed, the [Hungarian]
Guard would come and that would calm things down for a while.” To this
statement the Hungarians nodded and said they would be grateful for that.

After the March 6 rally of the far-right party
[Jobbik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobbik), members of the new version of
the [banned Hungarian
Guard](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/23/hungary-the-hungarian-guard-
banned/) arrived in the village. A group of
[_betyárs_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwayman#Hungary.2FSlovakia),
people who dress and act like the 18th-19th-century Hungarian “highwaymen,”
appeared as well.

The far-right news site _Kuruc.info_ [had an
artcile](http://kuruc.info/r/6/75726/) (HUN) on what this group of six
“highwaymen” experienced in Gyöngyöspata:

> […] The betyárs reported that the Hungarians in Gyöngyöspata were happy
> because of the presence of the guardist neighborhood watch and the betyárs.
> Since their arrival, there's finally peace and calm in that part of the
> village where the Hungarians live. It's not like that on the gypsy side,
> where the 460 Roma are raging because they can't terrorize the elderly in
> the village, nor can they steal from them. […]

As the events unfolded, more and more journalists were travelling to
Gyöngyöspata and publishing reports about the situation. Orsolya Fehér, a
political analyst, [quoted](http://radicsbela.blogspot.com/2011/03/roma-
neighborhood-under-control-of.html) a Roma news site [So
Si?](http://www.sosinet.hu/2011/03/14/felelemben-elo-romak-gyongyospatan/)
(HUN), which had Roma journalists reporting from the village:

> […] “We went to Gyöngyöspata on Thursday, March 10, and found we had to
> cross two checkpoints reminiscent of war movies to enter the Roma
> neighborhood,” wrote the
> [www.sosinet.hu](http://www.sosinet.hu/2011/03/14/felelemben-elo-romak-
> gyongyospatan/) website. At that point, tension was intense between the Roma
> and the people clad in black uniforms surrounding them. “During our
> interviews, the local Roma residents told us about psychological terror and
> humiliation they were suffering, the constant fear they felt. It is not safe
> for them to leave their homes, even to go to work.” In their declaration,
> the local Roma drew attention to the fact that the members of the Hungarian
> Guard, hiding behind the Civil Guard Association for a Better Future and
> “gendarme” uniforms and openly supported by the Jobbik party, have kept the
> Roma residents of the village in a state of constant fear for the past two
> weeks. The situation has come to a point where the Roma are terrified to
> leave their houses, stopped sending their children to school and do not even
> feel secure inside their own homes. […]

Zupast of [_Mikor? Melyiket?_](http://mikor-melyiket.blog.hu) blog commented
the situation in a post titled [Terror on the gypsy row](http://mikor-
melyiket.blog.hu/2011/03/14/terror_a_ciganysoron) [HUN]:

> […] This particular Neighborhood Watch Association for a Better Future is
> just named a ‘neighborhood watch’. The National Neighbourhood Watch
> Association, which has a code of ethics that prohibits discrimination on
> race and practice of party politics, distanced itself from the vigilantes of
> Gyöngyöspata. For Jobbik, it's not about a small settlement in Heves
> [county] but about the country-wide promotion coming with it. Simply, they
> needed a Roma pogrom to prove to those with the lowest intellect in the
> society that the beloved party wouldn't forsake them in clearing the air.
> […]

The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (HCLU) together with the Hungarian
Helsinki Committee and the Legal Defence Bureau for National and Ethnic
Minorities (NEKI) [sent a letter to the Minister of the
Interior](http://tasz.hu/en/news/terror-extremists-and-state-inactivity-
gyongyospata) on March 13. In the meantime, on the basis of local
investigations, HCLU took [a legal
position](http://tasz.hu/files/tasz/imce/gyongyospata-legal_position.pdf)
(.pdf) on the situation in the village:

> The frightening act of the people arrogating the role of maintaining public
> order is not protected by freedom of assembly. With their threatening
> appearance, they questioned the absoluteness of state force-monopoly. The
> inactivity of the police caused legal uncertainty.

After the [March 15 national holiday](http://visitbudapest.travel/budapest-
events/march-15th-national-holiday/), members of the paramilitary organization
left Gyöngyöspata, but the news about the alleged new targets were published
right away.

By Friday, news site _[origo]_
[reported](http://www.origo.hu/itthon/komment/20110318-orban-viktor-pinter-
sandorra-bizta-a-jarorozo-gardistak-problemajanak-
megolfdasat.html?cmnt_page=1) (HUN) on the governmental meetings on
paramilitary organizations and on the situation of Gyöngyöspata. The article
stated there was no visible action taken in regards to the events in the
village on behalf of the government – even though PM Viktor Orban and the
Minister of the Interior had said several times earlier that they would not
tolerate paramilitary organizations.
