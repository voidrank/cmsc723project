Mike, in [_Central American
Politics_](http://centralamericanpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/06/tackling-
chronic-hunger-in-quiche.html), writes about the [Maya Food Security
Programme](http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=56179), “an initiative designed
to combat chronic malnutrition through the distribution of monthly food
rations and the sponsorship of workshops, fairs and street theater on
nutritional education.” He says that “over ten thousand Guatemalan families in
[the] Quiché
[[department](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quich%C3%A9_Department)] benefit
from this program.”
