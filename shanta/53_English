[Women of Minya Day by
Day](https://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/women-of-minya-day-by-
day/) is the newest project of the [New Women Foundation
[ar]](http://www.nwrcegypt.org) based in Cairo. Nevine Ebeid and other members
of the Foundation team will provide workshops to women living and working in
[El Minya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minya,_Egypt) located approximately
250 km south of the capital city. The target participants will be women who
work in informal agricultural and domestic jobs, and who are often faced with
discrimination and harrassment. The team will show the women how to use
digital tools, such as audio recorders and video cameras to capture images in
order to tell the stories of their daily work lives, and which will be
featured on the New Women Foundation website. In this video, Nevine talks
about how the project will be a first step towards advocating for increased
rights of the women and to give this population a voice online.
