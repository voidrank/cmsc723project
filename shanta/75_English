Francisco Toro from [_Caracas
Chronicles_](http://caracaschronicles.com/node/2675) introduces the
documentary “Moving Pictures o Los Autos de Caracas” by Chris Moore, which was
[released online](http://vimeo.com/14825956) this week: “The film is a
methodical meditation on just how Venezuela's dream of modernity went so badly
off the rails.” Francisco will review the documentary in installments over the
coming weeks.
