On August 15, the television channel France 4 rebroadcasted a documentary
entitled: _“Who is afraid of the Gypsies?”_ produced in 2009 by John Paul
Lepers. [Le post writes](http://www.lepost.fr/article/2010/08/14/2184288_qui-
a-peur-des-gitans.html) [fr]:

While the destruction of camps and expulsions of
[Roma](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roms) announced by president Sarkozy and
interior minister Brice Hortefeux are in full throttle with the silent
approval of the majority of the public opinion, some doubts start to creep in[
even from within the UMP](http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/roms-le-
gouvernement-ne-veut-pas-entendre-parler-de-rafles-17-08-2010-1225953_20.php)
( the ruling party) and some bloggers who do not usually venture in these
debates cannot help but express their outrage.

_Bienvenue chez les roms,_ a blog published in the newspaper La Tribune de
Genève, [found musicians in Hungary who happended to be named
Sárközy](http://roms.blog.tdg.ch/archive/2010/08/14/de-s%C3%A1rkozy-a-sarkozy-
c-est-la-musique-qui-change.html), and shares with us some witty tidbits:

> It is a common name with the Roma in Hungary, I won't speculate that our
> Sarkozy is of Roma origin but it's not out of the realm of possibility. In
> fact, I identified a musician who plays in a band called the devilish Romas.
> What if our Sarkozy was one of them? A devilish one who forgot his origin,
> his sense of rhythm and his songs and only leaves us with a noisy cacophony
> on top of having an identity crisis but focusing his attacks on Roma people.

_Bah by CC_ [feigns](http://www.bahbycc.com/2010/08/hortefeux-les-rroms-et-la-
mercedes.html) to be naive :

The usual themes of _dernier des blogs_ are ” photos, digital culture, sci-fi
and comtemporary art”. But the author expressed his anger that the higher
sphere of the State took aim at such an easy and vulnerable target as the
Gypsies. In an article on [owni](http://owni.fr/#aujourd-hui) entitled the
[biweekly news on the Roma](http://owni.fr/2010/08/05/la-quinzaine-du-rrom/),
he provides an in-depth [analysis](http://www.hyperbate.com/dernier/?p=12029)
on his blog [fr]:

> There is another issue. It seems to me that these nomadic populations are
> saying much more about us, that they are the grain of sand in the well-oiled
> machine. They used to be the oil that allowed the machine to function since
> the Roma were often the vectors of innovative technology, of know-how or
> just manpower for critical seasonal work in the agricultural business. While
> they might be as well-integrated as they have ever been, their way of life
> remains at odds with the modern world. This status, instead of being
> considered as a thorn in our side, ought to be valued immensely, because it
> tells us an awful lot about ourselves ( we the sedentary ones).

On august 4, The website [La voix des Rroms](http://www.lavoixdesrroms.org/)
started an [online petition](http://www.mesopinions.com/Pour-l-egalite-de-
traitement-des-Rroms-et--gens-du-voyage--en-France-petition-
petitions-97c5e40af4535c088c3154f4710fa689.html) to ask equal treatments for
Roma and the itinerant community addressed to the French population at large.
Meanwhile, the countries of origin of the non-French Romas displayed
contrastingly different attitudes.

[Romania](http://lci.tf1.fr/monde/europe/2010-08/expulsions-de-roms-la-
roumanie-met-en-garde-la-france-6040746.html) warns against “populist
behavior” and “xenophobic reactions” that their deported citizens may
encounter at the border. Laurentiu Mihu and George Lacatus, on the blog
_Robin-woodard_ [explain ](http://www.robin-
woodard.eu/spip.php?article1147)the reality of the problem [fr]:

> While the dismantlement of the Roma camps accelerates, some large shopping
> centers do not hesitate to have guards follow the Gypsies in their aisles.
> Worst, they are sometimes forbidden from entering stores. The daily
> newspaper România libera reported seeing such events in Rouen and La
> Rochelle.
>
> […]
>
> Elena B. a Romanian with Roma ties lives and works in Rouen. She says: ”
> Before, we were free. Now, as soon as we enter a store, they suddenly
> realize you are Roma from Romania and they track you until you leave the
> store. »
>
> She understands sentiment of the majority of French though: ” At first, Roma
> only stole food and French people tolerated it. Then some went overboard and
> started stealing to make a sale later. On top of stealing food, they now
> steal expensive stuff. Now, we are not allowed to taste the sample products
> anymore.»

On the other hand, Bulgaria seems to be [indifferent to the fate of their
citizens](http://balkans.courriers.info/article15741.html) in Western Europe
says _Le Courrier des Balkans:_

> When do Bulgarian seem to care about the issue of the Romas ? Only when the
> Bulgarian fringe of this minority becomes a problem for another country.
>
> Immediately, the average Bulgarian citizen who believes that Bulgaria is
> aching because of the Ottoman reign and the larceny committed by Romas will
> react thusly:” See, now europeans know what Roma people are up to. They
> ought to stop bringing up their human rights and whatnot” … the real problem
> is, the Bulgarian government does not behave any differently than the common
> Bulgarian person.

Are “insertion village” the answer? Café Babel
[investigated](http://www.cafebabel.fr/article/34506/villages-rroms-reve-
politique-realite-sociale.html) in those supposedly paradise for Romas and is
reflecting the skepticism of many:

> The members of the EU mentioned the issue twice during session focused on
> community integration. Yet nothing concrete came out of it. It's worse and
> worse. At the parliament, everyone spoke about it. They show they care but
> no concrete measures are ever taken. The strategy must include a text
> specific to the Roma situation. It is quite urgent, actually. »
>
> Between political wishful thinking and the harsh social reality, Roma people
> are always caught in no man's land. One of their representative think it
> could last another decade.

Maybe it's Italy who can show the way, far from the xenophobic clichés. _Café
Babel_[adds](http://www.cafebabel.fr/article/34672/des-rroms-arranges-en-
italie.html) :

> What is the Italian equivalent to the insertion villages made in France ?
> None. But something is happening there. The Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno,
> who was the first to hire a Roma in his team and the city of Treviglio is
> oft cited as a model of integration
