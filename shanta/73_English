In _Citizen of La Paz_ , Luis Ramos [writes [es]
](http://citizenlapaz.blogspot.com/2010/09/ley-antiracismo-en-bolivia-mi-
opinion.html)about his opinion on [the anti-racism
law](http://achacachi.blogspot.com/2010/09/anti-racism-law-guarantees-
equality-in.html). Journalists [are
concerned](http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/bolivian-journalists-criticize-
anti-racism-bill) about the law and have criticized it as an attack on freedom
of speech, to which Luis responds, “is it that hard to leave racial insults
aside?”
