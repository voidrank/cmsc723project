In Chile, a cup of coffee at Starbucks costs more than the baristasâ€™ wages for
one hour of work. This is what the 3 [union leaders
[es]](http://twitter.com/#!/sindicatosbux) on hunger strike in Chile state
through a handwritten sign [in this video [es]](http://vimeo.com/27090401).
They demand Starbucks to comply with [only 4 out of the original 25 demands
[es]](http://www.theclinic.cl/2011/07/29/huelga-de-hambre-en-starbucks-un-
cafe-amargo-que-no-chorrea/): adjusting their wages which have been the same
through 7 years despite inflation, include a lunch subvention, provide
employees with uniforms and assist with transportation costs for those who
live far from work.
