In Venezuela, folk art is one of the most genuine expressions that communities
have of their surrounding beauty. Art historian Ricardo Ruíz from the
[University of the Andes [es]](http://www.ula.ve/) refers to [folk art as art
that falls outside of academic conventions, and that is often considered
“naif” or “rural” (.pdf
format)](http://kaleidoscopio.uneg.edu.ve/numeros/k09/k09_art09.pdf).
Generally, folk art has been defined as rural art, and its examples, in many
cases, were pre-Hispanic works. Folk art has often been thought as less
important than other academic art because of its informal state. However, Ruíz
considers that the phenomenon of folk art, especially in Venezuela, should be
understood as expressions that mutate and move in distinct directions, which
follows in the same direction in which the artists intended in regards to
beauty, history, life, and death. And now, this art is appearing online,
reaching an audience that was not previously possible for many folk artists.

Luis Acosta, one of these folk artists has created a blog as a way to promote
other folk artists and published “[A Guide to Artisans
[es]](http://artesanosdevenezuela.blogspot.com/p/artesanos-y-artistas-
populares.html)” An example of one of the artists presented can be found in
[this video
[es]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5rxZZF2QCU&feature=player_embedded).
According to Acosta:

> La mayoría de (estos artistas) no disponen de los recursos tecnológicos que
> provee internet para darse a conocer (…) Esta iniciativa es gratuita e
> independiente (y) está sustentada por el trabajo voluntario…

The majority of (these artists) do not have the technological resources of the
internet to become known (…) This initiative is free and independent and is
sustained by the voluntary work..

Another project in which Acosta, along with 10 other artists, have come
together to present their works online for the public in exhibitions is
_[Aravaney [es]](http://aravaney.blogspot.com)_. The collective is presented
in this video:

On his [own blog [es]](http://www.luisacostaartesano.blogspot.com), Acosta
shows his work and promotes the work of this fellow artists and artisans:

> …me he dedicado al modelado en arcilla y a la pintura desde el año 1984
> cuando vivia en caracas , mi ciudad natal, desde 1993 resido en valencia
> (Venezuela). La imaginería de las devociones religiosas populares de
> Venezuela , sus personajes típicos y figuras de nuestra historia, han sido
> los motivos de mi trabajo con la arcilla y la pintura durante estos años (…)
> en esta página quiero mostrar ese trabajo y también el de otros creadores y
> artistas populares de mi país y del mundo…

I have dedicated myself to clay modeling and painting since 1984 when I lived
in Caracas, my birth city. Since 1993, I have lived in Valencia (Venezuela).
The imagery of the folk religious devotions of Venezuela, the typical
characters and figure of our history, have been the motives of my work with
clay and painting during these years (…) in this page, I want to show this
work and also the work of other creators and folk artists of my country and of
the world.

From Caracas, Elgar Ramírez also promotes folk artists and their work through
blogs. In his blog, [Artesanía en Tapara
[es]](http://artesaniaentapara.blogspot.com/2010/07/yaritza-molina.html), he
shows art made with seeds, wood, and
[gourds](http://www.flickr.com/photos/barloventomagico/2454740575). Ramírez
describes the purpose of the blog:

> …es promover y difundir a artesanos que elaboran piezas únicas e
> irrepetibles, de excelente calidad, en tapara, semillas, madera… Y con la
> posibilidad de contactarlos directamente.

…to promote and spread the word about artisans that create unique,
unrepeatable, and high-quality works with gourds, seeds, wood… And the
possibility to contact them directly.

This [photo

showcases the work of Yaritza Molina, who works with gourds in the community
of Palo Negro in the Aragua state.

With these initiatives, folk art is now going down roads that had not explored
previously. Pieces of art that showcase the aesthetic imagination of its
people can now be seen by others around the world thanks to these
technological advances, when previously it was only accessible by those living
around the place where the art was made. This is one of the many ways that art
and technology have worked together in the past several years. It is quite
possible that these spaces will be beneficial for the spread of art and the
vision of the surroundings that are little known, but that talk about life and
the knowledge of a Venezuela that is not well-known outside of its borders.
