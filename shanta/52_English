For those who take note of social categories a new one has been created: that
of ‘marriage mates’.  
The _tomo-fuhfu_ (where literally _tomo_ means ‘mates or friends’ and _fuhfu_
‘married couple’) is the new term coined by writer Megumi Ushikubo to indicate
those couples who have grown apart from each other and have in common only a
marriage in name, sometimes with children, but nothing more. The married
‘friends’ may not see each other for an extended period of time, don't spend
time together and certainly don't have sex.

This new category first appeared in Ushikubo's latest book _Tada Tomo-fuhfu no
Riaru_ (The reality of the ‘just marriage mates’), where, basing her
observations on interviews with dozens of Japanese couples, she investigates
the marriage condition of those who decided to get married for convenience to
someone who is more like a friend than a soul mate or a lover. The book also
recounts the collective experience of many husbands and wives who ended up
being simply ‘married friends’ because their love vanished or perhaps had
never really existed.

[commented](http://blog.livedoor.jp/fight8bluemagic/archives/51515171.html) on
some findings in the book and said she lent it to her husband.

> 読んでいて、ドキっとしたのは・・、  
>  出産後、3年以内に夫への愛情がなくなる  
>  う゛う゛・・。  
>  育児中、夫が役に立たないと思うことがある、  
>  むむむ・・。  
>  夫がこども返りをする。  
>  あ゛あ゛ぁ〜・・。  
>  3年以内といわずに３ヶ月ですでにそんな兆しがあるんだから、笑ってもいられないけど。

I was startled when I read that …  
“Within three years after a baby is born, love for the husband vanishes” booo.  
“During child-rearing some [women] begin to think that the husband is useless”
mmm.  
“The husband tends to behave like a child” awww.  
Some times it is not even three years but rather three months when those
symptoms start to emerge. There is certainly nothing to laugh in that.

In recent years, many like Ushikubo (who is also the [author of a book on
ladylike men](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/27/japan-grass-eaters-
salaryman-macho) [en]) have tried to give names to social trends that have
mushroomed in the Japanese society: heterosexual men less interested in the
opposite sex have been categorized as
“[herbivore](http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/world/japan.herbivore.men_1_japanese-
men-men-and-women-girlfriend?_s=PM:WORLD)” [en] and expressions such as
“[marriage hunting](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/13/japan-marriage-
hunting/)” [en] has entered the daily vocabulary.  
_Tomo-fuhfu_ seems to be another convention that only time will decide whether
it's just something that sells books and brings consulting companies customers
or is actually a sign of a transformation in the deeper levels of society.

[According to yomo](http://hatena2010.blogspot.com/2010/09/blog-post_13.html)
this new conception of the married life is something that belongs to the newer
generation, where equal opportunities are taken for granted and one's own
space and time is a must.

> 婚姻関係のある夫婦であるのは間違いないのですが、冷蔵庫の中身は夫と妻で所有権が別。すなわち食料品に名前が貼ってあります。  
>  同じ地域に住んでいても住居は別だったりします。いわゆる週末婚という奴で、休みの日はどちらかの部屋で過ごしたりしてるみたいです。  
>  理由は、趣味の邪魔をされたくないとか、お互いの自由を束縛したくないとか諸々です。  
>  ただ、仲が悪いかと言えば決してそうでは無く、どちらかと言えば仲の良い夫婦だったりする訳です。

There is no doubt that they are a married couple but husband and wife have
ownership rights on different parts of what's inside the refrigerator. In
other words they have their name on the food.  
Even if they live in the same area, they may live in different houses. This is
what is called the ‘weekend marriage’ where on holiday or free days, one of
them may go to spend some time at the partner's place.  
Reasons may be that they don't want to be disturbed in their activities or
they both don't want to have their freedom restricted and so on.  
But it cannot be said that their relationship is bad or poor, it would be more
accurate to say that they are spouses who need their own space to get along
with each other.  
I read that this is an absolutely logical mentality that is based on a man-
woman relationship that has transformed.

Discussions on married friends or marriage mates often raise comment on
surveys on the sex life of the Japanese married couples and the low birth rate
of the country. A blog, for instance, [reports](http://kozukai55.seesaa.net/)
[ja] that one third of the married couples do not have sex, while another
[quotes](http://aurahappyland.ti-da.net/e3102431.html) [ja] a survey by condom
maker Durex which says that in 2008, Japan was the least sexually active
country in a 26 country ranking.  
Although it seems quite difficult to have precise statistics on the matter,
[ayikes said]( http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/ayikes/diary/201009150000/) that a
lack of sexual drive is one of the characteristics of the _tomo-fuhfu_.

> これ、どんな夫婦かっていうと  
>  ・一人の時間をお互い大切にする夫婦  
>  ・夫婦でいつでもどこでも一緒とかありえない  
>  ・帰省はそれぞれの実家にばらばらに帰る  
>  （子供がいても）  
>  ・週末婚、通い婚、別居は多いに歓迎  
>  ・夫が草食系イクメン率が高い

>  ・夜の営みとかそんな生々しいことは子作り目的以外はしません  
>  ・当然夫婦共働き  
>  ・同居の場合は夫領域と妻領域が分けられている

To explain what kind of couple this may be:
