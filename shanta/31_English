[es] wonders why Bolivia doesn't have a TV channel in
[Aymara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymaran_languages) or
[Quechua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua_languages), considering that
the country is now ruled by an ‘indigenous government': “Modern media like
radio and television are ways to keep a language alive and in full use. When a
language is not used that language dies.”
