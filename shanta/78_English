[Koroga is an Africa story involving poets and
photogpraphers](http://africancolours.com/african-art-
features/596/kenya/koroga_enchants.htm): “At the heart of Koroga is a deep
desire to understand how art shapes our social imaginations. Poets have
responded to a range of images that capture the density and play of
contemporary living, the beauties and tragedies that surround us.”
