Juan Arellano writes in his blog [_Globalizado
[es]_](http://arellanos.blogspot.com/2010/08/la-nina-que-dibujaba-
piolines.html) about a girl on a street in
[Huancayo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huancayo,_Peru) who captured his
attention because she didn't act like other children working on the street:
she was drawing on the ground. He recorded a short video of their
conversation.
