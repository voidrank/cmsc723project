It is a story that has reached all corners of the globe from the [New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/world/africa/zambia-chinese-
supervisor-dies-during-protest-at-mine.html "New York Times") to the [China
Digital Times](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/08/chinese-manager-killed-at-
zambian-mine/ "China Digital Times") – the tragic death of a Chinese
supervisor at a coal mine in southern Zambia, allegedly at the hands of
striking workers demanding the implementation of the [minimum
wage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/21/zambia-new-minimun-wage-pits-
employers-against-government/ "minimum wage") which the Zambia government had
recently announced.

Collum Coal Mine in the Gwembe Valley area of Sinazongwe is not without
history. In October 2010, two Chinese supervisors allegedly shot at protesting
workers and injured 11 of them. The two supervisors were arrested and charged
with appropriate offenses but the matter was
[discontinued](http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/chinese-mine-bosses-cleared-
zambia-shooting "discontinued") in the courts of law through a [_nolle
prosequi_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolle_prosequi).

The mine has also had [problems](http://maravi.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/govt-
gives-collum-mine-ultimatum-to.html "problems") with government officials in
the past. In 2010, then Southern Province Minister Elijah Muchima described
the plight of the workers as sad, saying they were subject to slave wages and
worked under hazardous conditions and explaining that the workers there earned
between Zambian kwacha 57,000 and 500,000 (between US$ 15 and US$ 100) per
month.

In 2006, another provincial minister, Alice Simango, [openly
wept](http://www.asiawind.com/forums/read.php?f=3&i=239679&t=239609&phorum_auth=e4108b8c71cc72aa84513c65fb14bae7
"openly wept") after seeing miners during a tour of the mine emerge semi-naked
and barefoot from the tunnel. Simango, who was blocked from entering the mine
by the Chinese, later recommended that it be closed to protect human life.

The latest incident, which left a Chinese supervisor dead, elicited a lot of
reactions from netizens on various social platforms, ranging from blaming the
government for the abrupt manner in which it announced the minimum wage to
blaming the Chinese for taking advantage of the workers.

On one of the spin-off stories of the incident on the [Zambian
Watchdog](http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/2012/08/07/chinas-ambassador-to-
zambia-warns-of-deteriorating-relations/ "Zambian Watchdog"), commenter

Kwathu had [a different

The president of the former ruling party, Dr Nevers Mumba,
[blamed](http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/2012/08/07/mmd-condemns-killing-of-
chinese-manager-but-blames-pf-decree-of-minimum-wage/ "blamed") the PF
government for the killing:

> [M]any Zambians, including the MMD [[Movement for Multi-Party

> feel that the PF government has created a very volatile environment between

The government was quick to
[assure](http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/2012/08/07/zambia-still-safe-secure-
investment-destination-sakeni-assures-chinese-community/ "assure") investors
that the environment was still conducive but urged workers and employers in
the country to embrace dialogue in resolving their differences.

Leading satirist in Zambia Roy Clarke through his column, [Kalaki's

"Kalaki's Korner"), has also weighed in on the controversy by satirizing the
whole issue:
