This week was the birthday of the late Venezuelan poet [Aquiles
Nazoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquiles_Nazoa) , but unlike other years in
which there many festivities, the cultural life in Caracas was kind of silent.
A couple of years ago around these dates, there were presentations full of
humor and anecdotes remembering the poet, who used to write about the simple
things of life.

Nazoa had always led a simple life. His poetry illustrated the beauties of
daily life and the humorous soul of all Venezuelans. He was also one of the
most furious advocates of Human Rights during the 1960s in Venezuela and this
reflected his love for his people through his poetry. His work covered images
of folkloric heritage, children’s games, colors, and dreams without putting
aside political problems, freedom of speech and criticism of the bourgeois of
the time. All of this was covered with a sharp and delicate, and at the same
time, very authentic Venezuelan sense of humor. And as [_Dulceambar
[es]_](http://deloconocidoalodesconocido.blog.com.es/?tag=humor-y-amor-de-
aquiles-nazoa) writes, his works bring laughter to many. Nazoa is remembered
by many, and [_Poética del Empedrao
[es]_](http://bertavega.blog.com.es/2007/01/24/aquiles_nazoa~1610753) writes
that his greatest accomplishment is the eternal acknowledgement of his people.

According to [_Kalafia [es]_](http://kalafia.blogspot.com/2008/05/aquiles-
nazoa-el-poeta-de-venezuela.html), it was on April 25th, which marked 25 years
of his death. He describes Nozoa as:

> Un verdadero maestro, ese que pone el alma en las manos de sus alumnos. Lo
> conocimos en la Escuela de Letras de la UCV y allì nos enseñò la vida
> secreta de las muñecas y los àngeles, el misterio del vuelo erràtil de los
> caballitos del diablo sobre las aguas de los rìos. Hoy queremos rendirle
> homenaje, al llamado jocosamente “ruiseñor de Catuche” porque es el poeta
> que supo captar y expresar el màs puro sentir venezolano, eso que llaman “la
> conciencia nacional”. Y por ser tan venezolano era tan poeta, y tan
> humorista y tan polifacètico.

Nazoa was a real teacher, the one that puts his soul on the hands of his
pupils. We met him at the Faculty of Arts (UCV) and there he taught us the
secret life of dolls and angels, the mystery of the flight of the dragonflies
on river waters. We would like to pay him homage today to the poet humorously
called “Cantuche’s nightingale” since he was the poet that best knew how to
capture and express the purest feelings of Venezuelans, something we like to
call “the national conscience”. Being so Venezuelan was the reason for him to
be such a poet, so humorous, so versatile.

The blog [_Ilustres [es]_](http://www.ilustres.com.ve/?p=425) gives some
details of his life. Here we have the last activities, of great transcendence:

> Durante la década de los 70, además de preparar libros como La vida privada
> de las muñecas de trapo, Raúl Santana con un pueblo en el bolsillo y Leoncio
> Martínez, genial e ingenioso(publicado después de su muerte), dicta charlas
> y conferencias, mantiene un programa de televisión titulado Las cosas más
> sencillas y proyecta la formación de un grupo actoral que pusiera en
> práctica el «Teatro para leer». Muere en un accidente de tránsito (…). En su
> memoria se creó por proposición de Pedro León Zapata, la cátedra libre de
> humorismo «Aquiles Nazoa», inaugurada el 11 de marzo de 1980.

During the 1970s besides preparing books like (The private life of rag dolls,
Raul Santana with a town in his pocket, and Leoncio Martínez wonderful and
ingenious) he gives speeches and conferences, he presents a program called
Simple things and helps with the training of a theatrical group the “theater
to read”. He died in a car accident. In his memory, and through [Pedro León
Zapata’s](http://usuarios.lycos.es/apmaria/entrada.html) proposal it was
created the chair at the university “Aquiles Nazoa”, which started on March
11, 1980.

Among his works there were an important number of humorous pieces written in
verse for theater, with new versions of classics like Hernani and Cinderella,
among others that made fun of marital life and “high class” ladies with their
“new money” as a criticism to the new bourgeoisie. Here, a part of his
Cinderella on [YouTube [es]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNCXoZlqCXo).

Aquiles Nazoa was truly a wonderful soul to the Venezuelan body. Many literary
prizes and elementary schools have been given his name. He adored children,
people, pigs and dogs. He had a special devotion to people’s education and
struggle for justice. And since without an example of his works this post
would be incomplete, let’s do an effort in literary translation to bring to
this space a little piece from the poet:

> Verbos irregulares:
>
> Estos son unos verbos que, a paso de tortuga,  
>  Yo conjugo,  
>  Tú conugas,  
>  Él conjuga…  
>  Como sin garantías todo el mundo se inhibe  
>  Yo no escribo,  
>  Tú no escribes  
>  Él no escribe  
>  Pues de escribir las cosas que uno tiene en el seso  
>  Yo voy preso,  
>  Tú vas preso  
>  Él va preso

These are some verbs that, slow like a turtle  
I conjugate  
You conjugate  
He conjugates  
And since everyone is afraid with the lack of constitutional rights  
I don’t write  
You don’t write  
He doesn’t write  
For if one writes all the thoughts under the veil  
I go to jail  
You go to jail  
He goes to jail

His biography here, and more of his poems (in Spanish) can be seen

Finally, some bloggers have fond memories of childhood alongside Nazoa's
verses. _Plomo al Arpa [es]_ writes:

> Estudié toda la primaria y el bachillerato en el “Instituto Parroquial San

I studied all my life in San Juan Bautista de La Salle (a High School) in
front of Capuchinos Square and next to the old Zamora School. (…) Thus, I grew
up among that people and getting familiar with the architecture, playing at
the square, with its beautiful columns made of brick and finished in wood, its
pigeons and drunk men, representing little plays from a very famous book
called Humor y amor (Humour and love). I felt particularly close to this book,
since all I read and smelled the things that I felt it on my way to school,
and in my childish games in abandoned fields, and in my walks through all the
antique houses when they sent me to run an errand. One day, I came across a
poem about the Capuchinos Square's pigeon house and I thought it was a
wonderful detail that a poet could dedicate some lines to my games and when I
escaped from school. Afterwards, I would know that this poet had run in the
same streets and studied next to where I did and that he made a whole universe
with the most simplest things that he had seen, and most of them, were also a
part of my childhood. (…) The poet of simple things, the one that made me fall
in love again with my city and my beloved San Juan. Happy birthday Aquiles!
