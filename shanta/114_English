In April, the biggest internet-related music sensation for the people from
former Yugoslavia and especially the related diaspora has been the song “Kuća,
poso” (Eng. “Home, work”) by the “star of Canada and America” Ekrem Jevrić
Gospoda, originally from the [Plav-Gusinje](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plav)
region of Montenegro.

> Here I live in the City of New York  
>  I live and work, but only work
>
> Home, work  
>  Home, work  
>  Work, home  
>  This is what I know  
>  I know nothing  
>  And where can I know
>
> Oh New York, may darkness kill you  
>  Because you let a woman rule  
>  You contain a whole lotta dogs  
>  A whole lotta concrete  
>  And battalions of women march the streets
>
> But New York become a city of light  
>  Get rid of all the women that work  
>  They lost the children, the greatest treasure  
>  Hey New York, you great city

The [official version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgNkJfTfHa4) of the
video reached over 1.8 million views on YouTube within a month of its release,
with a total of over 2.3 million views together with various duplicate
versions and remixes.

In comparison, the [official
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UjsXo9l6I8) for the global hit single
about New York City, [“Empire state of
mind”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_of_Mind), by
[Jay-Z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z) and [Alicia
Keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Keys), has generated 39 million
views within the 6 months since its release – 7 million per month on average.

Facebook and Twitter users from all ex-Yugoslav countries, including
[Slovenia](http://twitter.com/KaktusKaktus/statuses/12996256975),
[Croatia](http://twitter.com/Edse/statuses/12932245373) and Macedonia spread
the link, turning the song title into a
[meme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme). The phrase in the song title is an
ordinary colloquialism designating the never-ending routine of daily grind
during a life devoid of meaning. Sarajevo group [Zabranjeno
Pušenje](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabranjeno_pu%C5%A1enje) (“No Smoking!”
in English) used it in its 1999 song [“Pos'o, kuća,
birtija”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVHxU9y3DtA) (Eng. “Work, home, pub”)
about a _gray_ , wasted life after a lost love.

One could object that the song has misogynist overtones, but it also expresses
the existentialist [angst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angst#Existentialism)
felt by nostalgic immigrants or guest workers unaware of
[Camus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_%28novel%29) or
[Socrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing). During
his first concert, the author says that he wrote the song to explain to his
people about stuff that the Americans cannot understand.

The unique interpretation style and appearance have incited various types of
reactions, from praises to insults, such as comparisons with the howling of
the [White Fang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fang) in a comment to the
official video, to labeling him as “The Balkans
[Borat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBKqPVCqgUI)” in a copy of a [video
report](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBKqPVCqgUI) [CRO] from a live concert
in Queens.

There Mr. Jevrić performed as supporting act to
[lascivious](http://www.google.com/images?q=selma+bajrami&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-

Bosnian [turbo-folk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo-folk) star [Selma
Bajrami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_Bajrami). YouTube user
_MegaMotika_ said in a comment to this video:

> The man is truly a star: not everybody can get 1.5 million views in 15 days.
> He became popular, and the fact that everyone laughs is another issue. The
> man is a showman.

This newly acquired fame has provided tangible benefits: that video also
documents the receipt of a honorarium in cash. It does not contain a direct
statement by the singer – allegedly, he asked for $1000 for an interview.
Gospoda’s nickname means “[gentry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry).”
