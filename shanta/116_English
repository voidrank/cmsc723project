[Nagaland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagaland) is a state in [Northeast
India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India), bordering
[Burma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma). The population of Nagaland,
almost two million people, is
[tribal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_people) and the majority is
Christian. Some Nagas feel disconnected – “[racially, historically,
culturally, politically](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/nscn-im-draws-youth-by-
hordes/23704-3.html)” – from India, and have been fighting to [protect the
“unique identity” of the Naga
people](http://www.eurasiareview.com/201006143199/indias-nagaland-intractable-
talks-south-asia-intelligence-review.html) from mainstream Indian influence.
Nevertheless, a different culture has been making an impact in Nagaland in
recent years – that of Korea.

The term “[Korean Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_wave)” refers to
the popularity of Korean culture around the world, but particularly throughout
Asia. It has become a noticeable phenomenon in other parts of Northeast India
such as [Manipur](http://www.himalmag.com/Chopsticks-in-Manipur_nw3435.html).
At community media initiative
[IndiaUnheard](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/29/india-video-giving-a-
voice-to-marginalised-communities/), Renchano Humtsoe has produced a video
report highlighting concerns about the growing influence of Korean culture in
Nagaland. She
[writes](http://indiaunheard.videovolunteers.org/renchano/wave_of_korean_culture_hits_nagaland/):

> Korean culture is flooding into Nagaland. New trade treaties between India
> and Korea facilitated the exchange of Korean goods and enabled them to enter
> Nagaland with greater ease. Additionally, Nagas have long felt neglected by
> the central Indian government. This is especially the case with Naga youth.
> Many believe this lack of identity with central India informs Nagas’ embrace
> of Korean culture. […] Naga youth have now started to adapt Korean culture.
> Korean television channels, programs, movies, and clothes are popular among
> Naga youth. Korean companies are looking into investing in Nagaland. The
> Nagaland State Government has even taken steps to embrace Korean culture: it
> hosts an annual Indian-Korean cultural festival. However, this wave of
> Korean culture threatens traditional Naga customs. […] Traditional Naga
> culture is unique. Nagaland is comprised of sixteen tribes. Each tribe uses
> a unique language and has its own rich cultural traditions of dance, song,
> festivals and other key features. Korean culture’s strong pull on young
> Nagas will make it more difficult to preserve Nagaland’s important tradition
> and identity.

Writing at GroundReport, Stella Paul, the Communications Director for [Video
Volunteers](http://www.videovolunteers.org/) (the organisation which
established IndiaUnheard) talks about Renchano's
[video](http://www.groundreport.com/World/Koreanization-of-Nagaland-A-Report-
truly-Unheard/2925536):

> The most watched TV channel in the state is the Korean channel [Arirang
> TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arirang_\(TV_network\)), the DVD and CD
> shops are bursting with Korean films, the hottest hair-dos offered by salons
> are the ones flaunted by popular Korean actors and actresses, shops are
> selling street fashion that are currently in vogue in Korea, cultural events
> in the state has special ‘Korean songs’ contests, sport events now have
> categories like ‘Korean wrestling’.

Otojit Kshetrimayum, Assistant Professor in Sociology at
[Sikkim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim) University, in collaboration
with Ningombam Victoria Chanu, writes an [in-depth
analysis](http://mappingculturaldiffusion.blogspot.com/2008/04/mapping-
cultural-diffusion-case-of.html) of the nature of the diffusion of Korean
popular culture through Korean satellite channels, music and movies in
neighbouring [Manipur state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur):

> The introduction of cable television network has played a significant role
> in the dissemination of culture to other societies. [..] The Korean
> satellite channel Arirang is the harbinger of Korean wave in Manipur. Its
> popularity began largely due to the ban on Hindi satellite channels, which
> used to be the favourite channels of the Manipuris. They started to look for
> an alternative channel, which could give them wholesome entertainment.

Otojit writes about the Hindi channel ban:

> Hindi films and Hindi television channels, except national channel DDTV,
> which is under the state control, were
> [banned](http://www.himalmag.com/Chopsticks-in-Manipur_nw3435.html) by one
> of the underground revolutionary organizations of Manipur in the year 2000.

Another key factor is the [cultural
proximity](http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/185385934.html)
theory, which suggests that media productions from culturally affiliated
countries have greater reception than those from more culturally distanced
countries. According to Otojit, North Indian tribes have many elements of
culture in common with the Koreans.

At The Marmot's Hole, a blog about topics related to Korea, Robert Koehler has
watched Renchano's report and
[writes](http://www.rjkoehler.com/2010/07/06/korean-cultural-invasion-of-

He adds:

Another commenter, abcdefg, looks at why Korean culture is
[popular](http://www.rjkoehler.com/2010/07/06/korean-cultural-invasion-of-
nagaland/#comment-380740):

So, is there a real reason for concern about Korean influence on Naga culture?
Is such influence an inevitable part of “globalisation”? Or is this just the
latest fad that will pass in time? What do you think?
