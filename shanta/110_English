The Puerto Rican independence activist [Lolita
Lebrón](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_Lebr%C3%B3n) died on Sunday August
1, 2010. She was 90 years old. Lebrón commanded a group of Puerto Rican
independence advocates who attacked the Congress of the United States on March
1, 1954 to denounce the Island's colonial situation under the US.

Lolita Lebrón

That day, nationalists Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irving Flores and Andrés
Figueroa Cordero opened fire in the US House of Representatives and unfurled a
Puerto Rican flag and Lebrón shouted “¡Viva Puerto Rico libre!” (Long Live a
Free Puerto Rico!). Lebrón reportedly fired at the ceiling. Five congressmen
were wounded but no one died. Upon being arrested Lebrón declared: “I did not
come here to kill anybody. I came to die for Puerto Rico.” Lolita Lebrón spent
25 years in a federal prison in the United States. President Jimmy Carter
granted her clemency in 1979.

Lolita Lebrón remained steadfast in her beliefs. In June 2001 she was arrested
for performing non-violent civil disobedience to protest against the US Navy
military presence in the Puerto Rican island of
[Vieques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieques,_Puerto_Rico#Protests_and_departure_of_the_United_States_Navy).
After years of intense activism and massive civil disobedience acts, the US
Navy withdrew from the island of Vieques which they had used as a military
base and bombing range for 60 years. Later in her life, [Lebrón publicly said
that she had come to believe that non-violent methods were more effective than
armed struggle](http://www.prdream.com/wordpress/?p=2298) [ES].

On the day of her death, last Sunday, Lebrón was honored by hundreds of people
in a memorial service in the Ateneo Puertorriqueño. Hundreds of mourners
assisted the mass in the San Juan Cathedral on Monday and her burial in the
Old San Juan cemetery where other important independence fighters lie, such as
the leader and President of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party [Pedro Albizu
Campos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Albizu_Campos).

Lolita Lebrón earned the respect of [people from different political
ideologies](http://www.vocero.com/noticias/locales/9734-personalidades-
reaccionan-a-la-muerte-de-lolita-lebron.html) [ES]. But she still stirs
controversy within some circles. For some she is a freedom fighter, while
others condemn her for using violence. Most bloggers from Puerto Rico honored
her memory. Feminist blogger Nahomi Galindo convened a group of women to write
about Lebrón and then posted their texts in her blog [_Poder, Cuerpo y
Género_](http://galindomalave.com/) [ES]. One of the participants, feminist
activist, journalist and scholar Norma Valle Ferrer describes Lebrón as a
symbol of _independentista_ women:

> Lolita Lebrón ha sido la heroína emblemática de las mujeres independentistas
> de Puerto Rico durante décadas. Esto es así sin menoscabo de sus compañeras
> del nacionalismo, el independentismo y el socialismo, desde Mariana Bracetti
> hasta las lideresas universitarias de nuestros días. El desempeño de su
> tarea revolucionaria y la imagen pública de Lolita no fue mediatizada ni por
> el sexismo histórico ni por los medios de comunicación. No pudieron hacerlo.
> Su acto heroico y la foto que la convirtió en un ícono la marcaron como
> líder de un comando armado, como mujer a quien nadie calla, como decidida en
> la lucha por su patria.

Lolita Lebrón has been a hero and an example for _independentista_ Puerto
Rican women for decades. This has not obscured the importance of her
nationalist, pro-independence and socialist _compañeras_ , from Mariana
Bracetti to today's student leaders. Her revolutionary work and her public
image were not mediated by historic sexism nor mass communications. They could
not do it. Her heroic act and the
[photograph](http://www.freedomarchives.org/La_Lucha_Continua/Lolita_Lebron.html)
that made her an icon marked her as the leader of an armed commando, as a
woman who is not silent, determined to fight for her country.

In the same blog, lawyer and activist Eva Prados describes Lolita as human
rights activist:

> Lolita fue y será una de las grandes líderes femeninas de nuestro país. Ella
> nos (re)afirma el papel protagónico que han tenido las mujeres en la
> historia de éste pueblo, aunque nuestra historiografía oficial tienda a
> resaltar las figuras masculinas. Pero lo que la mantendrá viva por siempre
> en mi recuerdo fue su valor y entrega por el respeto a los derechos humanos
> de todos y todas con su lucha por la libertad y libre determinación del
> pueblo puertorriqueño, derechos humanos del más alto rango a nivel
> internacional, y el cual nuestra Lolita no renunció a reclamar hasta el
> final.

Lolita was and will always be one of the most important women leaders of our
country. She is an example of the leading role women have had in the history
of this country, although our official history tends to highlight men. I will
remember her for her courage and commitment to human rights through her
struggle for freedom and Puerto Rico's self-determination. These are human
rights of the highest international level, which Lolita fought for until the
end of her life.

Liza Sabater, a Puerto Rican blogger who lives in New York and the founder of
_[culturekitchen](http://culturekitchen.com/)_ [EN], also [honored
Lolita](http://culturekitchen.com/liza/blog/lolita_lebron_a_true_patriot_a_true_sheroe_a_true_puerto_rican):

> One of the biggest mistakes people make in the United States is to say that
> Lolita was representative of a fringe group of Puerto Rican nationalists. To
> be a _nacionalista_ in Puerto Rico is to believe that we as a country have
> the right to our own cultural identity on the way to winning our right to
> being a political and economic sovereign nation.  
>  _Nacionalismo_ in Puerto Rico is the social, cultural and political
> reaffirmation of our sovereignty as an independent culture, an independent
> nation and an independent country. I will be damned if you would find many
> Puerto Ricans willing to deny that they have those rights.  
>  If you polled Puerto Rico and asked the simple question, “Do you consider
> yourself culturally a Puerto Rican or an US American?”, you would get a
> resounding Puerto Rican on that question because from a social and cultural
> standpoint we are all nacionalistas.  
>  Lolita Lebrón wasn't an outlier in a sea of colonized Puerto Ricans
> chanting “Oh Hosay Canyu Sí”. Lolita was an outlier in terms of being
> willing to open fire on the US Congress and maybe die while doing it for the
> cause of Puerto Rico's independence.  
>  And that's why she is a terrorist to many US colonialists while being a
> sheroe to many Puerto Ricans like me.

Feminist blogger and lawyer Verónica Rivera Torres [remembers how her parents
admired Lolita [ES]:](http://mujeresenpr.blogspot.com/2010/08/muere-gran-

As a child I grew up listening to the story of how my father and my mother
(before I was born) had gone to welcome Doña Lolita Lebrón when she was
released from prison, along with Irving Flores and Rafael Cancel Miranda. They
had spent more than 25 years in jail for opening fire in the US Congress. They
waited for her at Baldorioty de Castro Avenue, and they followed her to Pedro
Albizu Campos’ grave. Today Lolita has died. My mother has lit candles in her
honor. All of us who dream that another country is possible are in mourning.
