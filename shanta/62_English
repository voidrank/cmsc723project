Africa is a Country discusses [the film Madagascar in the context of Africa's
image in movies](http://africasacountry.com/2010/10/13/africa-on-film-
madagascar/): “It doesn’t take a microscopic reading to see that Madagascar is
a colonial narrative. The West is represented as the norm, and Africa is
represented as savage and exotic to promote the idea of Western normalcy.”
