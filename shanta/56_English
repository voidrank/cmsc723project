[Le Point](http://www.lepoint.fr/), a French weekly news magazine, was the
victim of a “militant” of the new order that is rising up against the portrait
being painted of residents of immigrant communities. In a short article
entitled [“LE POINT, un magazine
engagé”](http://loffusque.blogspot.com/2010/10/le-point-un-magazine-
engage.html) (LE POINT, an activist magazine), the blog called _L’Offusqué_
(Taking Offence)[ explains](http://loffusque.blogspot.com/2010/10/le-point-un-
magazine-engage.html) [fr]:

> We’ll get right to the point. Issue no. 1895 of the magazine Le Point, in a
> cover story on “Things We Can’t Say,” contains an article written by its
> publication director, Franz-Olivier Giesbert, also the bravest reporter in
> France, called “One Husband, Three Wives.” The article was meant to tar and
> feather those horrid French polygamists of ever-increasing numbers whose
> public assistance payments are growing to obscene amounts.

[CCM](http://www.erwanngaucher.com/Cross-Media-Consulting,1.media) reveals a
technique used by French journalists who are interviewing foreign-born
Frenchmen of modest surroundings, many of whom live in [the suburbs
](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banlieue_parisienne)[fr]. The article is
[Journaliste en banlieue et correspondant de guerre, même combat ? (Journalist
in the suburbs and war correspondent—same combat?) [fr]
](http://www.erwanngaucher.com/03/10/2010/Journaliste-en-banlieue-et-
correspondant-de-guerre--meme-combat-,1.media?a=447), the reporter called on a
“fixer,” because for some people, reporting from the suburbs is like being a
special envoy to Bagdad:

> Le Point got taken by a “fixer.” What exactly is a “fixer”? The term is
> usually used for “interpreter-guides” that assist journalists in Iraq and in
> war zones in general, as explained by [Marc Epstein in a report on these
> shadow men and women in
> L’Express](http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/economie/profession-

In a post called [The manipulating and manipulated
press](http://jmph.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/10/04/la-presse-manipulante-et-
manipulee/), the blog _Des petits riens_ reports [fr]:

Here is how the journalist @si introduced the video and the article on

The sociologist Eric Fassin used the hoax as the basis for the article
“[Polygamy: Le Point and the Societal-Media Fabrication of Moral Panic
](http://www.mediapart.fr/club/blog/eric-fassin/041010/polygamie-le-point-et-
la-fabrication-sociologico-mediatique-d-une-paniq),”[fr] showing how
journalists and others in French society came to believe that many families
living in the suburbs are polygamists:

> In fact, there is only one verified figure in this field: one sample showed
> 65 out of 4439 adolescents were from a polygamist father, in other words,
> fewer than 1.5%.

We find the following information in [an article on polygamy in
Senegal](http://www.afrik.com/article10121.html)[fr] (where many of these
people are from):

> According to a survey of Senegalese households published in 2004 by the
> Senegalese Institute for Statistics and Demographics [20], 6.6% of women in
> Dakar in 2002 entered into this type of marriage. In rural areas, the figure
> was twice that.

Fassin continues:

> “Today, the debate has taken shape…the problem with polygamous families is
> that they cause delinquency.”

In Senegal, reactions to the impact of polygamy on society are minimal and
opinions are divided. The Comments section of the blog Chez Gangoueus offers
a[ detailed exchange on the effects of polygamy in
Senegal](http://gangoueus.blogspot.com/2009/10/khadi-hane-le-collier-de-
paille.html) [fr].
