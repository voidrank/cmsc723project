What if someone asked for advice on their dream path and you felt it wasn’t
the best choice for them? What is the right thing to do?

This is an anonymous blogger’s thoughtful response to [an
article](http://livedoor.2.blogimg.jp/j1nn/imgs/a/f/afc72bed.jpg) [ja] where a
11th grader who is interested in a career in drawing, be it illustration,
anime, or manga, asked anime creator and director [Tomino
Yoshiyuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiyuki_Tomino) for advice. [
_Update (added January 15th, 2010) – Matt Alt
has[translated](http://altjapan.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/01/dream-
cleaver.html) this article in English on his blog._] Yoshiyuki agrees with the
girl’s parents that she should go to a regular university and get a job as [an
office lady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_lady) because simply having
aspirations are not enough to thrive in this field. Unless of course, she’s
ready to make a commitment armed with skills, determination, and readiness for
hard work.

_Below is an English translation of the blog post “[Making someone give up on
their dream](http://anond.hatelabo.jp/20100917191635)” (夢を諦めさせる). _

> As someone who manages to make a living as a freelance designer, I sometimes
> get questions from students with an interest in design. “I'd like to become
> a designer,” they say to me. In most cases, my intuition tells me they don't
> have what it takes, but how am I supposed to express that to them, how am I
> supposed to tell them to give up on their dreams? You have to be so
> extremely careful with your words when saying this kind of thing.
>
> So that's what got me thinking: how do you tell this to a kid of high-school
> age without — as much as possible — hurting their feelings?
>
> In all honesty, people who take something that they like doing and decide to
> do it for a living are actually a little insane. Which is not to say that
> they are stupid. In fact, the majority of them are clever. Whether these
> people be animators or manga artists though, the fact remains that the
> majority of them barely make enough money to pay the bills, working under
> outrageous working conditions. If you think logically about it, there is no
> question that people who avoid these risks and stick to ordinary work end up
> living a more enjoyable life. Nonetheless, these people who do this type of
> work are so devoted that they lose the ability to even realize this fact.
>
> So as soon as I hear someone saying to me, “I’m thinking about becoming
> XYZ”, I already know they're not cut out for it. They're simply too rational
> for this career path. Even if they actually found a position, they would
> keep questioning whether to continue, and will not succeed. Faced with a
> rough path ahead, does the person who wavers and has second thoughts stand
> any chance against the person who plunges forth without any hesitation? You
> can tell if a person has this kind of determination just by looking at them.
>
> The ones who say “I want to become XYZ, but I’m not sure how I should
> proceed”, aren’t cut out for it either. Successful people in any field have
> the uncanny ability to look objectively at their own abilities, and in
> addition to just being able to identify their shortcomings, they are able to
> survey their field and see with certainty what they need to do. I think we
> could even call it instinct. You’ll have to excuse me, but I find it really
> sad that the people around this girl haven’t been able to make her

> All in all, it’s easy to tell her, “You’re still young and there are plenty

> real kindness. If they were the “real deal”, they’d go down that path

> I’m very happy to receive so much feedback on this provocative post. Thank

>
> Because I wrote in a way that upset people who are already on this road,

> Also, any discussion about how “regular” jobs are also difficult is so

> Whether or not to say things like this to a person face to face is a

> An ordinary but appropriate opinion is to have the person follow their dream
