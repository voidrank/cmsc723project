The image accompanying the unified blog post on many Serbian blogs states:
“Don't let them flood you.” Image widely circulated on blogs and social
networks.

In late May 2014, Serbia was hit hard by flooding in what became the [largest
natural disaster](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/05/19/serbians-take-
flood-relief-into-their-own-hands/) the region has seen in the past century.
The catastrophic floods not only have taken a yet unknown number of lives and
homes, but have also brought to light the pressure and censorship the current
government, led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), has been placing on
media.

Bloggers, journalists and rights-conscious Internet users have banded together
in the aftermath of the massive floods with a flood of their own – a [unified
blog post](http://stasakoprivica.com/u-lice-cenzuri/) [sr] speaking out
against censorship and media intimidation that was posted and [reposted on
dozens of
blogs](https://www.google.rs/search?q=u+lice+cenzuri&oq=u+lice+cenzuri&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.5146j0j8&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8#q=%22u+lice+cenzuri%22)
[sr] in Serbia over less than a day.

As flooding surged in the region, leaving several cities in Serbia under three
or more meters of water, the Serbian government instated a state of emergency.
Apart from aiding in the evacuation of flooded areas and supposedly allowing
for more efficient government functioning, the state of emergency also gives
authorities certain liberties, such as detaining individuals for “inciting
panic during a state of emergency.”

As Internet users began commenting and sharing information on social networks
and blogs about the floods, many of them also criticized the government's lack
of due warning for a natural disaster of this size and its poor response in
some areas.

With the state of emergency in place, some social media users were brought in
for questioning by police forces under the suspicion of “inciting panic” for
criticizing government relief efforts.

Originally written and posted by what seems to be a small group of organized
local bloggers who intentionally began spreading it across the web, the post
first appeared on May 24, 2014. At the time of this post's publication, it has
spread rapidly among social media users throughout the region and carries a
now widely popular hashtag on Twitter –
[#ulicecenzuri](https://twitter.com/hashtag/uLiceCenzuri?src=hash) (“in the
fact of censorship”). A [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/U-lice-
cenzuri/641549512589387) for the movement created on May 24 has already
garnered nearly 800 likes.

The viral post, titled “In the Face of Censorship” and with a subtitle
containing a clear message to authorities – “Because you can't arrest us all
or proclaim us crazy” – begins:

> U danima kada, usled nemara, nesposobnosti i neodgovornosti vlasti, hrabri i

> U nedostatku snažne parlamentarne opozicije, uz mali broj štampanih i

The post also mentions some of the web pages and articles that were taken down
before its publishing and adds that bloggers and journalists “cannot help but
assume that more will be taken down.” An English translation of the post is
available on the [Balkanist.net website](http://balkanist.net/in-the-face-of-
censorship/).

Some larger group blogs or websites by independent users, such as that of
Serbian daily Blic, have taken down the reproduced posts or are burying them
deep within the sites, perhaps hoping the issue will blow over and be
forgotten. One user of the blog portion of privately-owned news and media
network B92 reproduced the post on his blog and tweeted:

> Prvi tekst sa mog bloga koji B92 nije linkovao na naslovnu stranu

Many bloggers and journalists have added their names to a long list of
signatures at the end of the post, and others like Sandra Kravic Simonovic
also [added a few words](http://sandrakravitz.com/2014/05/u-lice-cenzuri-jer-
nas-ne-mozete-sve-pohapsiti-a-ni-proglasiti-ludima/) of their own to the blog
post upon republishing it on their personal blogs. Kravic Simonovic introduced
the reproduced blog post by saying:

> Ovo nije prvi put da se na ovom blogu piše o cenzuri. Nažalost, moram

Newly-elected Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, the country's former deputy
prime minister, is know for using [repressive measures against
media](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/02/02/political-pressure-on-
serbian-media-begins-to-show-on-tv/). During the February 2014 election
campaign, Vucic's team reacted to a parody video of him by [requesting that
several copies](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/02/05/viral-
video-of-deputy-pm-triggers-cyber-assault-in-serbia/) of it be taken down from
YouTube. They allegedly also took down several personal websites that made the
video available for download to other Internet users.

Another popular hashtag accompanying #uLiceCenzuri is
[#ZatvorUp](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23zatvorup&src=typd),
which translates to #PrisonUp. Apparently, in spite of Serbia's notoriously
slow judicial system and overcrowded prisons, people are saying that they are
willing to be jailed to defend their freedom of expression in a country that
is desperate for reforms, rule of law and much needed recovery.
