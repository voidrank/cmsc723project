József Ángyán, the former Hungarian [State Secretary in the Ministry of Rural
Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zsef_%C3%81ngy%C3%A1n),
started his own fight against corruption. Ángyán resigned in January and since
then [he has been raising
concern](http://fn.hir24.hu/nagyinterju/2012/04/27/angyan-orbannak-uzenem/)
[hu] about the shady relations between the government and some Hungarian
‘oligarchs’ – [Lajos Simicska and Zsolt
Nyerges](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/16/us-hungary-
idUSBRE83F0KG20120416) [en], who are often referred to as PM Viktor Orbán's
close allies and members of the highly influential business elite.

Mr. Ángyán is now struggling now to draw attention to the inconsistencies in
state land lease tenders that show that certain influential people's companies
are having more auspicious positions. But it looks like it's a sensitive
issue, and he has to face retaliation of the powers others also had tried to
call into account.

Prior to Mr. Ángyán's initiatives, journalists from time to time also had a
chance to discover that the ‘oligarchs’ in Hungary were able to control the
media. One of these journalists was Attila Mong, also known [for his fight for
free media in the country](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/24/hungary-
presidents-in-correspondence-journalist-in-blind-copy/). He published a post
on his blog titled [You-Know-Who and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named](http://napifix.postr.hu/post-018) [hu], in which he summed up the
mentions of Zsolt Nyerges and Lajos Simicska in the mainstream media based
upon the data of a Hungarian media monitoring agency. He drew the conclusion
that these two persons had become “[the
Voldemort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort)” of almost every media
outlet in Hungary.

Mr. Mong later quit his job at Origo.hu, a Hungarian news site, and joined
atlatszo.hu, where he [explained](http://atlatszo.hu/2012/04/17/ujraindult-a-
talalkozni-akarok-lajossal-es-zsolttal-fb-oldal/) [hu] what happened after the
You-Know-Who and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named post on his blog and a Facebook page
he started right after publishing it:

> […] Since I thought it was not right like that, I started a Facebook page at
> that time to reveal how many people would be interested in [reading] a real,
> in-depth, bold interview with them. The aim was and still is to lure them
> out. If they have no problems with public money flowing into their companies
> then they might not have any problems with journalists posing questions to
> them and demanding transparency on behalf of the public. The Facebook page
> [I want to meet Lajos and
> Zsolt](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tal%C3%A1lkozni-akarok-
> Lajossal-%C3%A9s-Zsolttal/336061866429767) became very popular in a couple
> of hours.
>
> I apologize to those who soon saw that the page was not there anymore.
>
> It turned out I'm not strong enough for that.
>
> I'll share the details one day in my memoirs. […]

Demonstrating how some citizens were disturbed by the opaque ties between the
oligarchs and the governing party, stickers with the text [“Who is Lajos
Simicska?”](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0oya4v31g1qe6t5lo1_1280.jpg)
started popping up in the toilets of random Budapest bars.

Lajos Simicska and Zsolt Nyerges became really popular with the Hungarian
netizens, who produced [funny pictures and animated
GIFs](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/simicska) using their old portraits
published in dailies. Gergely Karácsony, an MP with the LMP “Politics Can Be
Different” Party, used one of the funny pictures with a cat on skis on [his
blog](http://karacsonygergely.blog.hu/2012/03/12/miben_kulonbozik_az_allam_egy_rablobandatol)
[hu] (cat on skis is a pun on the name of Mr. Simicska in Hungarian). Mr.
Karácsony published the post titled “What makes the state different from a
bunch of gangsters?” after Transparency International Hungary's release of the
[National Integrity Study](http://www.transparency.hu/NIS_2011_english), which
stated that the Hungarian state had been captured by private interest groups.
In addition to the former State Secretary's claims, Mr. Karácsony listed the
cases when the two influential businessmen might have received remarkable
shares through their company which way too often turned out to be the winner
in public procurement tenders.

Last Wednesday, Mr. Ángyán had to face quite a sophisticated attack in the
battle for justice. Kettős Mérce blog
[reported](http://magyarinfo.blog.hu/2012/05/02/nem_letezo_bloggal_mocskolja_az_mti_angyant)
[hu] that the Hungarian news agency MTI was referring to a blog in their
article about Mr. Ángyán which was created not long before the publication of
the text. Kettős Mérce authors shared a
[screenshot](http://magyarinfo.blog.hu/2012/05/02/nem_letezo_bloggal_mocskolja_az_mti_angyant)
of their Google Search without any result. From 14:20 “till 16:30 no one was
able to find the blog on the internet but then it showed up,” wrote Kettős
Mérce. HVG.hu news site eventually [was able to obtain the
link](http://hvg.hu/gazdasag/20120502_angyan_jozsef_vm) [hu] to the blog from
MTI. Napraforgoblog has only [one post](http://napraforgoblog.blog.hu/) [hu]
about the former State Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development.
Napraforgo's post lists some fishy cases in which Mr. Ángyán allegedly was
involved. The title of the post is “Whose Mercenary Was Ángyán?”, and so far
it has more than three hundred comments. Hungarian netizens were shocked over
the strange practices of the newswire and also complained that they lost their
trust in the Hungarian media.

Even the Hungarian Parliament started this week with a discussion of the
‘oligarchs’. Mr. Karácsony questioned PM Viktor Orbán about the ties between
the influential business elite and the government
[[video](http://youtu.be/4zZQ5o2kzbk), hu].

Véleményvezér blog reported that the PM's first reply to the question was to
change the meaning of the word ‘oligarch’ to something meaning a capitalist or
a tycoon. Véleményvezér
[wrote](http://velemenyvezer.blog.hu/2012/05/08/megvan_orban_gyenge_pontja)
[hu]:

> […] In reality, an ‘oligarch’ means a wealthy person who is able to
> systematically distract the state's politics from serving the public
> interest to serving his private interests. An oligarch is a tycoon, too, but
> he has mainly been gaining and maintaining his fortune by sucking the
> state's resources (hunting for shares), meanwhile, in the case of other
> tycoons, the main source of income is not the state. […]

Mr. Orbán tried to avoid giving a real answer to Mr. Karácsony. The blogger
wrote:

> Although the debate ended there in the Parliament, it's hardly possible that
> the question of the oligarchs would fade away. Viktor Orbán's reply clearly
> demonstrates that he has no proper answer to the accusations of [having
