In El Salvador, more than 20 artists and LGBTQ rights activists
[painted](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/06/30/el-salvador-activists-
hold-21st-annual-pride-march/) crosswalks with the colors of the rainbow LGBTQ
pride flag between the Boulevard of Heroes and Andes Avenue. This is the first
time that a Central American country has authorized support for the LGBTQ
community in this way.

To have a permanent work of art in the center of the country's capital city,
the Salvadorian LGBTQ community achieved an important advance in their
visibility and their normalization in society, something that goes far beyond
the Gay Pride Month which is organized in June.

Watch the video report (in Spanish) created by El Faro TV. The report shows
the different ways in which artists got together and prepared the art
intervention. For Nicolás Rodriguez, an activist for LGBTQ rights and the main
organizer behind the idea, the rainbow crosswalk can be seen as a great symbol
of respect for both pedestrians and also sexual and gender diversity:

The artists are celebrating since their creation, called “The Big Show in the
Sky”, will have a lasting impact on Salvadorian society. In addition to
representing the sexual diversity that includes all Salvadorian citizens, the
project hopes to keep pedestrians safer.

El Salvador has suffered an [increase in
violence](http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2017/03/07/denuncian-aumento-de-crimenes-
de-intolerancia-contra-comunidad-trans-en-el-salvador/#0) against members of
the LGBTQ community, especially those who are transgenders or transsexuals. In
spite of certain [government
initiatives](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/El-Salvador-
Issue-Brief-ES.pdf) to protect the rights of the LGBTQ community, the number
of attacks against LGBT persons has not decreased, partially because of
problems associated with gang and police violence that has resulted in the
[murder of over 600](http://es.insightcrime.org/noticias-del-dia/policia-
pandillas-ejercen-violencia-poblacion-lgbt-salvador) homosexuals,
transsexuals, or transgenders since the 1990s. These acts of violence are seen
today as well, not only in terms of physical violence, but other cases that
include people who suffer from threats, extortions, and those expelled (from
their homes and their countries).

In this context, this public work of art is a step forward for the rights of
the LGBTQ community in El Salvador.
