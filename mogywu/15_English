Northern Hungary has recently become the center of rising conflicts between
the Roma and the Hungarian communities. In the community of Gyöngyöspata, for
example, [paramilitary organizations marched a month
ago](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/19/hungary-waiting-for-the-
hungarian-guard/), claiming they were members of a neighborhood watch, even
though their far-right stance was obvious.

**A village without a mayor**

On April 19, 2011, [this
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4leE69oaco&feature=related) [hu] was
posted by a Roma news site [So Si?](http://www.sosinet.hu/) [hu], covering the
rumors spreading in the Roma community of Gyöngyöspata about a paramilitary
organization's plans to hold a training camp in the village. On the same day
came the news of the resignation of the local mayor.

_Piroslap_ blog, referring to a news agency,
[wrote](http://piroslapok.blog.hu/2011/04/19/totalis_kaosz_lemondott_gyongyospata_polgarmestere)
[hu] that the mayor had explained his decision to resign by health reasons.
About the training camp, _Piroslap_ wrote this:

**The Roma have left**

By Friday, April 22, some 300 Roma had left Gyöngyöspata, allegedly because
they were afraid of the vigilante group arriving at the village for training.
According to [news
reports](http://www.portfolio.hu/en/cikkek.tdp?feed=1&k=2&i=22121), the
departure of the Roma women and children was organized by the Hungarian Red
Cross and Richard Field, an American businessman who had already expressed his
concerns about the situation of the Roma in Hungary and even started [a non-
governmental organisation](http://www.americanhousefoundation.com/) to support
them.

The Hungarian media used the word ‘evacuation’ for what happened, whereas
government officials claimed this wasn't an evacuation: according to them, the
Roma had been taken on an Easter holiday trip for the weekend.

Both [Péter
Szijjártó](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9ter_Szijj%C3%A1rt%C3%B3), the
spokesman for the Prime Minister, and Minister of the Interior [Sándor
Pintér](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1ndor_Pint%C3%A9r) have offered an
explanation for what happened. [This
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVgPwpcBJ9M) [hu] shows Pintér at a
press conference held in Gyöngyöspata on Friday. He said:

> They [the members of the paramilitary group] took away the happiness which
> was offered by the charitable organization Red Cross. The national board of
> the Red Cross invited the women and children from the Gyöngyöspata families
> for an Easter excursion.

Also on Friday, the Minister of the Interior
[announced](http://www.politics.hu/20110422/government-creates-decree-to-
punish-unauthorized-patrolling) that the government had designed a “decree to
penalise civil guard activities conducted without prior approval by the police
or feigning a right to act as a keeper of public order.”

By Friday afternoon, the police dismissed the paramilitary training of Véderő.
According to news reports, the leader of the group Tamás Eszes was detained.
Far-right news site _Kuruc.info_ [re-published](http://kuruc.info/r/2/78013/)
[hu] these reports, adding an important piece of information: Tamás Eszes is a
man who was disqualified from the Hungarian Guard. (Other sources wrote that
Mr. Eszes would run for the mayor position now that Gyöngyöspata has no
mayor.)

Gellért Rajcsányi wrote that the biggest responsibility is that of the
government:

> […] We've been keeping the state for millennia to maintain the outside and
> inside security. The [improvident promise](http://csepel.info/?p=8822) [hu]

**Political action?**

Photographer Levente Hernádi [expressed his
doubts](http://lvnte.posterous.com/bazinagy-gyongyospatai-milettvolnaha) [hu]
over whether there was no interest in motivating the events. He pointed out
that the result of the events have been articles [like this one on a Hungarian
news site](http://hvg.hu/itthon/20110422_gyongyospata_katonai_tabor) [hu],
illustrated with photos about the Roma leaving the village, members of Véderő,
the Roma who stayed in the village and a Roma child. The article is a full
report about the Roma who left Gyöngyöspata for the weekend and who applied
for refugee status in the United States and Canada because of their threatened
situation:

> [… ] I think Gyöngyöspata was an extremely well-prepared play taking
> advantage of the always crying and ambiguously speaking Roma and of the
> national front that always acts nationalistic. It just had to be started and
> the rest went by itself.
>
> Maximum respect to the one who [does stories] [like this
> one](http://hvg.hu/itthon/20110422_gyongyospata_katonai_tabor) […].

By Sunday, the Roma women and children were back in the village.
