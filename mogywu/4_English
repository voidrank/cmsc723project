Russians could soon find themselves paying a tax to access their favorite
online content streams. Images mixed by Tetyana Lokot.

History tells us that citizens usually don't respond well to new taxes imposed
on them against their will (remember the [Boston Tea
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)?). When the Hungarian
government recently tried to foist an Internet tax on its people, thousands of
Hungarians rose up and [went into the
streets](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2014/10/30/netizen-report-
hungarians-reject-internet-tax-with-protests-motherboards), showering the
ruling party's headquarters with old computer parts.

You'd think other countries would learn from Hungary's example. But the
Russian government is now considering its own variant of an Internet tax, and
wants to make all Russian Internet users pay for consuming copyrighted content
online.

Whereas the Hungarian authorities wanted to tax Internet traffic per gigabyte,
the Russian idea, put forth by the Russian Union of Copyright Holders (RUC),
is a blanket solution for ensuring all users are automatically charged for
accessing copyrighted content on the web, regardless of whether or not they're
consuming it.

**How It Would Work**  
Under a concept known as “global licensing,” proposed by RUC in October,
counts a wide variety of online audio, video and literary content as
collective copyrighted property, and suggests that ISPs incorporate the tax
into their tariffs. Although the concept has not yet become a draft bill, it
already has a [snazzy website](http://global-license.ru/) that lobbies for the
idea.

The Russian government is generally in favor of the Internet tax proposal and
has appointed several ministries to collaborate on its implementation, but
Leonid Levin, head of the parliamentary committee on information policy, has
spoken out against the initiative.

RUC's head Sergey Fedotov, [told Izvestia](http://izvestia.ru/news/580268) the
tax would be 25 rubles ($0.35) per month for each web-enabled device.

> Стоимость лицензии для одного подключения к интернету, будь то мобильный
> телефон или проводной интернет, составит 25 рублей в месяц, то есть 300
> рублей в год. По имеющимся статистическим данным, это около пяти процентов
> от средних расходов каждого абонента на интернет.

> The cost of a license for each Internet connection, whether it's a mobile
> phone or broadband Internet, would be 25 rubles per month, or 300 rubles per
> year. According to our statistics, this amounts to about 5% of what an
> average Russian Internet user pays for their Internet connection.

Twenty-five rubles (about USD $.40) may seem like a negligible sum, but
between Russia's 130 million Internet users, it would add up to a significant
sum—and one that would ultimately burden ISPs. Internet users themselves would
not be paying the tax directly, but would instead incur the cost by
“automatically” accepting a license agreement and a higher price for their
Internet connection from their ISP of choice.

**What Will Be Taxed**  
The “global license” is a unique licensing tool that, according to the Russian
Ministry of Culture, will encompass “music tracks and recordings, audio-visual
content and literary works.” Content produced by media and entertainment
companies that is available online for free or is ad-supported would not be at
issue here: rather, the tax would cover those kinds of media products that
users would usually be expect to pay for, like a movie or a music album. But
RUC suggests less common types of content, such as movie fragments shared
online, might also be subject to taxation. In this respect, the new tax seems
to be aimed at combating online piracy, as well as at generating revenue for
right holders, adding to the existing [anti-piracy
legislation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/14/orphaned-in-us-sopa-
finds-home-in-russia/) in Russia.

The Ministry of Culture later
[elaborated](http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/10/12/2014/5486fe8dcbb20f3d846c6c96)
on the Internet tax idea, proposing to create a registry of copyrighted
creative content online, making it easier to track consumption. The Ministry
also suggested that ISPs should be obligated to install [deep packet
inspection (DPI)](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2009/06/deeppacketinspectionandinternet-censorship2.pdf)
equipment in order to identify which content users consume on the RuNet. The
DPI technology, Ministry officials say, will assure that the licensing tax
revenue (which they estimate to reach $860 million a year) is fairly
distributed among the copyright holders who own the rights to specific works.

The DPI technology specifications have already been developed for the Ministry
of Culture by a local IT company called Systematic, RBK news agency reports.
Systematic
[claims](http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/10/12/2014/5486fe8dcbb20f3d846c6c96)
their technology will be able to recognize up to 90% of unencrypted traffic,
but will not be able to analyze encrypted connections (like https) or torrent
data transmission.

Given that most users who access pirated content online do so through torrent
websites, use https, VPN protocols, or TOR to anonymize their connection,
Russian telecommunication experts are skeptical about the effectiveness of the
expensive technology suggested by global licensing enthusiasts.

**RuNet Reaction**  
The Internet tax idea has met [harsh
criticism](http://www.vedomosti.ru/companies/news/36684941/internet-kompanii-
i-pravoobladateli-vystupili-protiv-naloga ) from Internet industry
representatives, telecommunication providers, RuNet users, and even some
government officials. Mobile Internet providers MTS, Megafon and Vimpelcom
have spoken out against the concept of global licensing, and were joined by
critical voices from the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of
Communications.

Representatives of several other IT companies, including Mail.Ru Group, Yandex
and VKontakte, published an [open
letter](http://www.vedomosti.ru/companies/news/36684941/internet-kompanii-i-
pravoobladateli-vystupili-protiv-naloga?full#cut) addressed to President Putin
on December 1, arguing that the new system would be “harmful for authors,
copyright holders, users, the Russian Internet industry and the
telecommunications business.” The companies’ representatives also expressed
concern at the use of DPI technology to track users online, which they
suggested was “a form of surveillance that violated international norms.”
Forcing ISPs to install deep packet inspection equipment would only exacerbate
existing surveillance and censorship mechanisms in Russia, like the
[SORM](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/15/russia-sorm-medvedev-social-
networks-internet/) communications interception system and the IP-filtering
used to block websites currently on the [RuNet
blacklist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Russia).

The RuNet users demonstrated their dismay at the Internet tax by launching an
[online petition](https://www.roi.ru/16257/) on the Russian Civic Initiative
website to collect signatures against what they called an “automatic anti-
piracy fee” for all Internet users. The petition, started on December 6, calls
state officials to drop the Internet tax idea and instead consider alternative
means for protecting intellectual property, which would not violate citizens’
rights.

> Большинству пользователей придётся платить за контент, который они не
> потребляют. Такие налоговые отчисления будут производиться не в интересах
> всего населения и даже не в интересах всех российских пользователей
> интернета, но в интересах ограниченной группы лиц. Кроме этого, не будет
> никакой гарантии того, что правообладатели действительно станут получать
> какие-либо отчисления с этого налога.

> Most users would have to pay for content they do not consume. Such tax
> payments would not be made in the interests of all the citizens, and not in
> the interests of the RuNet users, but would only serve a limited group of
> people. Besides, there is no guarantee that the copyright holders would
> actually receive any royalties from this tax.

As of December 15, the petition had just over 14k of the 100k signatures that
it needs to be considered for discussion in the relevant parliamentary
committee.

If signed into law, global licensing scheme would leave RuNet users no choice
but to pay the Internet tax, as it would be included in their Internet bill.
For now, the Ministry of Culture is still discussing RUC's proposal, but hopes
to work with other stakeholders to create a draft bill by the end of 2014. An
official within the Ministry
[alleged](http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/10/12/2014/5486fe8dcbb20f3d846c6c96)
the discussion could even take a year or two. While this may seem far off, the
recent track record of Russian Internet legislation suggests the Internet tax
has every chance of becoming a reality.
