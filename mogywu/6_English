For Spain, the big news in the European elections is the triumphant emergence
onto the political scene of
“[Podemos](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Podemos/269212336568846)” [es] (We
Can) ([@ahorapodemos](https://twitter.com/ahorapodemos)), a political entity
created four months ago, led by the charismatic Pablo Iglesias, professor at
the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. With an electoral programme that brings
together the main demands made by the different social movements that arose
during the wave of opposition to austerity policies, Pablo Iglesias has
managed to position himself as the fourth largest political power in the
country.

The results of the [European elections](www.elections2014.eu/en), held on the
25th of May 2014, have drawn a political map marked by abstentionism and the
rise of right-wing nationalist parties on the old continent. In countries like
France with the Front National (FN) as winner, the Netherlands where the anti-
Muslim party is gaining relevance, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Hungary, the
rise of extremists paints a desolate landscape.

In Spain, although the Partido Popular (People's Party) returned to the lead
in the European election results, and the PSOE, the social democrat group, is
still the country's second largest party, an unprecedented crisis of the two-
party system is emerging. For the first time in Spain's democratic history,
the two main parties only managed to win half of the votes between them. This
is especially important in the face of the general elections that will be held
next year on the Iberian Peninsula.

From the _indignados’_ cry of “yes it is possible” to “We can”, there is a
step. The party represents the coming of age of the protests and new ideas
that have occupied the streets of Spain in recent years. Although its leader
may reject the _indignado_ movement's legacy, it is almost impossible to
ignore the close link between the anti-crisis movement and the new party. The
most well-known of the young but powerful Podemos’ proposals are: the creation
of a maximum salary as well as a universal basic income, an earlier retirement
age, the reduction of the working week to 35 hours, and more protection for
workers against dismissal, among others.

The objective is to dismantle the austerity measures put in place by the
different governments that have been in power. To strengthen and increase
citizens’ rights to political participation, education, housing, health and
the fight against corruption are the core elements of the party's programme.
Citizens have expressed their support for these measures at the ballet box, on
the streets and on the internet.

Among the [keys to the success](http://www.lamarea.com/2014/05/26/cinco-
claves-del-exito-de-la-campana-electoral-de-podemos/) [es] of this party,
which won 11.29% of the vote last Sunday, is its ability to connect with
citizens. Funded through various [crowdfunding
campaigns](http://crowdfunding.podemos.info/) [es], “Podemos” is the party
with the most followers on social networks, compared with the two main
parties, and keeping in mind its recent creation: more than 189,000 followers,
compared to 141,000 for the Partido Popular and 140,000 for the PSOE.

With the hashtag
[#Podemos25M](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Podemos25M?src=hash) twitter users
discussed the surprising Spanish result in the European polls. Some even
predicted reactions:

The electoral and online support shown for “Podemos” has allowed them to gain
five seats in the European Parliament, a surprising result given their lack of
resources and experience. Now citizens and rival parties are watching Podemos’
first steps at both the European and national level very closely.
