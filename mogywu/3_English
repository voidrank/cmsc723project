A monument to Diazepam in Skopje, Macedonia. Photo: F.Stojanovski. CC BY 3.0.

A unique sculpture appeared in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, on March 9: a
monument to the [antidepressant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant)
[Diazepam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam) (also known as Valium).

The item in question is a giant orange pill 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) tall. It was
installed [near a main boulevard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY40vSz-
yqs), along with the following explanation:

> Потрошувачката на антидепресиви последните две години е зголемен на над 1,6
> милиони реализирани рецепти (најмалку 2,5 милиони пакувања), покажуваат
> податоците на Фондот за здравствено осигурување.  
>  Претпоставките се дека во 2015 бројот на реализирани рецепти ја надминал
> бројката од 2 или 3 милиони пакување.
>
> Во случај на нужда одгризи парче од апчето.  
>  Еден гриз соодејствува на 2 mg од апчето – скулптура.

> Data from the State Health Insurance Fund indicate that consumption of
> antidepressants in the last two years increased to more than 1.6 million
> implemented prescriptions (at least 2.5 million packages). The estimated
> number of prescriptions used during 2015 is more than 2-3 million packages.
>
> In case of urgent need, bite a part of the pill.  
>  One bite equals 2 mg of the pill-sculpture.

With fewer than 2 million people living in Macedonia, the country's rising use
of antidepressants has activists concerned that the trend indicates a growing
“[pill
addiction](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/pill%20addiction%20grips%20the%20balkans),”
which they say is also occurring in [Bosnia and
Herzegovina](https://youtu.be/WqbGyhZsiHA),
[Serbia](http://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/srbija-je-fina-tek-posle-bensedina-
svaki-drugi-pije-sedative/rj5eex5), and Bulgaria. In 2014, the Health
Insurance Fund of Macedonia
[warned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_aKTHOleXs) that taking such
medicines at certain levels can be toxic, especially during pregnancy. The
fund's [latest
report](http://www.fzo.org.mk/WBStorage/Files/Polugodisen%20izveshtaj%202015%20potrosuvacka.pdf),
published in December 2015, shows that Diazepam was the country's second-most
prescribed drug between January and June last year.

report](http://www.fzo.org.mk/WBStorage/Files/Polugodisen%20izveshtaj%202015%20potrosuvacka.pdf)
from December 2015. Diazepam is in second place, sandwiched between
[Enalapril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enalapril) and
[Lisinopril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisinopril), which are used for
treatment of cardiovascular problems.

“The monument” has incited political debate online. For example, one Twitter
user joked that there would be violence in the streets, if people lost access
to their antidepressants.

Zaneta Skerlev, another Twitter user, implied that people in Macedonia are
turning to antidepressants to deal with stress induced by the government's bad
decisions, linking to a news story about the pill sculpture:

> Се надевам дека власта ова ќе го сфати лично.  
>  Се појави „Сменик на Дијазепам“ во Скопје <https://t.co/hKNaoGnjlo> via

> I hope the government will take this personally. A “Monument to Diazapeam”
> appeared in Skopje.

While no one has claimed credit for the Diazepam installation, the likeliest
candidate is a group of locally well known guerrilla protest artists.

#### The Skopje “School” of Guerrilla Protest Art

In recent years, Skopje has been an epicenter of huge government spending
through a project called “[Skopje
2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje_2014),” which [launched in
2010](https://globalvoices.org/2010/02/06/macedonia-online-rebellion-against-
skopje-2014-plan/). The Balkan Investigative Reporters Network
[revealed](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/true-cost-of-
skopje-2014-revealed) that taxpayers in Macedonia (one of Europe's poorest
countries) have been footing the bill for [€634
million](http://skopje2014.prizma.birn.eu.com/) ($698 million) in spending on
136 different “objects” (27 administrative buildings, including [a Triumphal
Arch](https://globalvoices.org/2012/03/28/macedonia-kazakhstan-triumphal-
arches-to-celebrate-20-years-of-independence/), 34 monuments, 5 squares,
Ferris Wheel, and [new
facades](https://globalvoices.org/2014/12/30/macedonians-hug-skopje-shopping-
centre-to-protect-it-from-baroque-isation/)).

Macedonia's cultural establishment has been largely complacent about the
“[beautification
projects](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/03/macedonia-
facade-150318135440964.html)” spearheaded by former Prime Minister and ruling
party boss Nikola Gruevski, as various forms of bribery and censorship have
[“erased critical voices”](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/critical-
voices-erased-from-macedonian-arts--11-05-2015) from Macedonia's mainstream
arts.

Simultaneously, a “guerrilla” movement of mostly anonymous independent artists
has used self-financed projects to offer commentary on current issues. The
movement uses conceptual art pieces placed in public spaces as a form of
protest. These artworks are short-lived, as the authorities often very quickly
dismantle them.

For instance, through Skopje 2014, the government approved construction of
four buildings in the shape of sailing ships located on the Vardar riverbed at
the center of Skopje. The city has never offered an official reason for why it
[added them to zoning plans](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/skopje-s-
pirate-ships-cause-stir), or explained their connection to local tradition or
history. The river has never been navigable, and the closest sea is over 240
kilometers (150 miles) away. Thanks to [taxpayer-funded
subsidies](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/photo-skopje-s-riverside-
galleon-sets-anchor), entrepreneurs with ties to the government use these
properties to operate [luxury
restaurants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewLsBmeiqe8).

On a hot August day in 2015, citizens noticed shark fins circling around the
“pirate galleons.”

The above [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-Z_5Bt1FtM)
attracted almost 200,000 views in a single day. Today, it has more than
260,000 total hits. Responding to the footage, Skopje's city government
quickly dispatched the fire brigade. The fire chief [personally
waded](http://www.vest.mk/?ItemID=6EBCEF6AF09D254CB7C723448B45F4C8) through
the river to try to remove the sharks. Upon reaching the fish, however, he
discovered that they were fake: the fins were styrofoam, attached to small
rocks to stay in place in the water.

Similarly, activists have protested the city's loss of green space, as more
and more trees are cut down to make room for new construction. Artists added
“eyes” to some trees downtown, [making them look
afraid](http://a1on.mk/wordpress/archives/505115).
