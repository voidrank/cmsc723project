The German newspaper _Die Welt_ published an interview
([GER](http://www.welt.de/die-welt/kultur/literatur/article5116030/Ich-
schreibe-keine-Holocaust-Literatur-ich-schreibe-Romane.html),
[HUN](http://konyves.blog.hu/2009/11/09/kertesz_nem_holokauszt_irodalmat_irok_hanem_regenyeket))
this weekend with [Imre
Kertész](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Kert%C3%A9sz), a Nobel Prize-
winning Hungarian author living in Berlin. Kertész celebrated his 80th
birthday on the same day as Germany celebrated the 20th anniversary of the
fall of the Berlin Wall. The journalist asked him about his attitude towards
Budapest and Berlin, the Hungarian author, annoyed with the political
situation in Budapest,
[replied](http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/article/11/hungarian_no/?cHash=c5df5b1948):

> I am a metropolitan person, I am and always have been. A metropolitan person
> does not belong to Budapest. The city is completely balkanised. A
> metropolitan person belongs to Berlin!

His words made several Hungarian bloggers upset, and a tense discussion
started right after the release of the Hungarian translations of the
interview. _Mr Falafel_ of [Konzervatív Költők Baráti
Köre](http://kkbk.blog.hu) (HUN, ‘Fellowship of Conservative Poets’)
[reacted](http://kkbk.blog.hu/2009/11/09/kertesz_imre_arsch_poetica) (HUN):

> […] In the interview he gave to Die Welt, he declared what every honorable
> Hungarian man thinks about him, that he is a stateless rogue who has nothing
> to do with Hungarians. […] Regarding the interview, the translations of
> certain news sources are different at the point that, according to Kertész,
> anti-Semites have been reigning for 10 years, or they have been only opinion
> leaders. I don't speak German, so I can't decide which translation I should
> trust. Actually, it's the same, both versions are imbecility. He is not
> living in Hungary, and he is not even interested in what's happening here.
> […]

_Lordart_ was also disappointed after reading the article. He wrote in his
[post](http://lordart.blog.hu/2009/11/08/kertesz_imre_2) (HUN):

> […] Till now I have been a little bit proud that there's a Nobel Prize-
> winning author of Hungarian origin, whose work – and the value of whose work
> – is recognized worldwide. After this I will still acknowledge what can be
> considered as value in the work of Mr. Kertész, but I will respect his will,
> according to which his personality can't be attached to Hungary, to
> Budapest. […]

Some bloggers condemned the translations published by the Hungarian media
because some points seemed to be exaggerated. _Vérszegény éjszakai dúvad_ of
[Hángörienidiocc](http://hangorienidiocc.blog.hu) (HUN) [re-translated the
whole interview](http://hangorienidiocc.blog.hu/2009/11/08/kerteszkedes_5)
(HUN), and added his comments to the controversial translations of the press:

> […] Simply and solely the whole Hungarian press was lazy to review a damned
> translation, every news report is an approximated word-for-word repetition.
> (Perhaps nobody speaks German in this country.)
>
> It sounds really very good anyway: “Don't attach me to Hungary.” And of
> course one can be shocked at it, but the problem is, which is always
> forgotten to be stated, that it's not about the origins, but rather about
> the literary roots.
>
> Otherwise, that can't be picked at either what Kertész thinks about Budapest
> or Berlin, because that would be approximately like if I picked at someone
> because he doesn't like goulash with beans; how can that be, if for me
> that's the favorite meal.
>
> […] It seems as if anything that Kertész had done, he couldn't atone for
> since then, because summarizing his interview this way looks rather like an
> intentional slant than a mistranslation. […]
