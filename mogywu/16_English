In a very sensitive environment because of [the new Hungarian media
law](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BK6KF20101221), which came into
force on January 1, 2011, the Hungarian [National Media and Infocommunications
Authority](http://www.nmhh.hu/index.php?id=menu&mid=599&lang=en) started
investigating [Tilos](http://tilos.hu) (HUN), a non-profit radio station.

Since the Authority “places a strong emphasis on the protection of the
interests of customers and users,” it also takes care of the young listeners,
which was the case when they
[informed](http://new.tilos.hu/upload/dokumentumok/Ice-NMHH-101213.PDF) (HUN)
Tilos Rádió that an investigation would be launched after monitoring the
station's broadcasts. The monitoring found that the radio station played
rapper [Ice-T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_T)‘s songs titled _Warning
(intro)_ and _It's On_ [at 17:53 on Sept. 2,
2010](http://tilos.hu/archivum/listen.php?file=2010/09/02/tilosradio-20100902-1730.m3u).

The Authority objected to the fact that Tilos Rádió did not use any kind of
age limit warning before playing the song. The letter mentions that the radio
station had already been fined in 2003 and 2005 for broadcasting music with
explicit lyrics. They attached a chart with the number of language
certificates obtained between 2000 and 2009 suggesting that there might have
been youth who understood the lyrics and because of their age might have been
influenced by the content.

Ice-T, who tweets under the username
[@FINALLEVEL](http://twitter.com/#!/FINALLEVEL), learned through a tweeted
[Tumblr post](http://sati1984.tumblr.com/post/2525789905/hungarian-media-
authority-punishes-radio-for-playing) that his music was “banned” in Hungary.
His reaction was:

> RT @rog_r: @FINALLEVEL Sorry, but you are officially banned
> http://j.mp/f73DhF > I love it! The world still fears me. hahaha !

Although the result of the monitoring is not without precedent, the National
Media and Infocommunications Authority has to deal with a very high volume of
attention because of the new media law, which has even [received international
criticism](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/12/31/hungary-viktor-
censorban/).

Tilos Rádió named the case “[Ice-T gate](http://hirek.new.tilos.hu/?p=1745)”
and collected the reactions to the news of the investigation. A number of blog
posts pointed out that the lyrics which were attached in English and with the
Hungarian translation to the letter from the Authority contained some
mistranslations. A Hungarian blogger who posts translations of rap songs
[stated](http://rapnyelv.freeblog.hu/archives/2011/01/01/fassbinder_pinakotekaja_avagy_a_hatosag_es_ice-t/)
(HUN) that the Authority used a transcript of the lyrics that already
contained some mistakes.

Despite the polemic that began at the end of 2010, Tilos Rádió has already
received an answer to their official
[statement](http://hirek.new.tilos.hu/?p=1812) (HUN) against the
investigation. The new letter of the Authority was also
[published](http://comment.blog.hu/2011/01/02/ice_t_nem_kossuth_az_nmhh_nem_naprakesz)
(HUN) on a blog, _Comment:com_ , dealing with media content. In their letter,
the Authority emphasized that “maybe the brave but frequently anonymous
freedom fighters of the internet can see reason that Ice-T is far away from
[Lajos Kossuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kossuth_Lajos), the real
[Hungarian] fighter of press freedom.”

Sixx of _Comment:com_ highlighted a paragraph from the letter in which the
Authority stated: according to the so-called [Pacifica
Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission_v._Pacifica_Foundation),
Ice-T's song could be aired only after 10 PM. “If they don't do so, the
American media authority – the Federal Communications Commission – would
punish them with a fine which is certainly higher than the yearly budget of
Tilos Rádió.”

The blogger of _Comment:com_ pointed out that the U.S. decision mentioned by
the Authority was no longer valid in the United States.
