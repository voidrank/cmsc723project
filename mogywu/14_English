Olive harvesting in Albania, John Paul II monuments in Poland, a Soviet
military hardware “cemetery” in Moscow, and more: Central and Eastern Europe-
based bloggers share their recent travel observations and photos.

**Albania**

\- _Stepping Stones_ has posted photos of two elderly Albanian village women:
[the first one](http://acrossthelana.blogspot.com/2008/11/olive.html) is
harvesting olives in “the old-fashioned way”; [the second
one](http://acrossthelana.blogspot.com/2008/11/daisy.html) has her black apron
filled with “tiny daisies,” which she is picking for a local company and gets
paid less than $1 per kilo.

Also, _Stepping Stones_ has spent some time at [the ancient city of
Apollonia](http://acrossthelana.blogspot.com/2008/11/apollonia-albania-
illyria.html) and visited [the Ardenice Orthodox Christian
monastery](http://acrossthelana.blogspot.com/2008/11/ardenice-monastery-
albania.html):

> […] Ardenice is an old Orthodox monastery which was saved from destruction
> during the times of totalitarianism. 4 monks still live and work there but
> they were away at the seminary today so we didn't get to see them. The site
> has been ‘reclaimed’ in recent years and is being well maintained and
> lovingly restored after being used for everything from a restaurant to a
> small hotel. […]

\- Kolin of _Living in Shkodër_ has been jogging around [the
city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkod%C3%ABr) lately “seeing ‘normal’
Albanian life,” getting “LOTS of really strange looks” and [taking pictures of
the old doors to private houses](http://shkoder.blogspot.com/2008/10/doorway-
to-real-albania.html):

> […] There are many of these and one street could have about 20 different
> kinds of doors. It is the old wooden doors that I really like.
>
> I think to myself, what kind of story could these doors tell us if only they
> could speak. […]

**Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia**

\- _Balkanology Blog_ has posted [some photos of
Croatia](http://www.balkanology.com/blog/2008/11/new-photos-of-croatia.html)
and, following [a tip from a fellow blogger](http://www.stuart-
pinfold.co.uk/blog/2008/11/mostar-to-dubrovnik.asp) (Stuart Pinfold),
[wrote](http://www.balkanology.com/blog/2008/11/its-long-way-from-split-to-
dubrovnik-if.html) about “the eccentricities of [Google
Maps](http://maps.google.com/) in giving driving directions between certain
points in Southeast Europe.”

First, there is Google's
[Dubrovnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik)-[Mostar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostar)
route:

> […] Instead of the conventional 150-kilometre drive that less creative
> mapping software might recommend, Google suggests a more adventurous
> approach: a ferry to Italy, some driving, another ferry to Greece, and more
> driving through Greece, the entire length of Albania, Montenegro, and
> finally Bosnia. At 1541 kilometres it's a mere 10 times longer than the
> usual route – and so much more interesting. […]

Then, there is the [Split](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split)-Dubrovnik
route:

> […] Sure enough, Google's answer does involve a drive along the Adriatic
> Coast – unfortunately it is on the other side of the Adriatic, between Bari
> and Pescara [in Italy]. […]

And there is also the Split-[Zagreb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb)
route:

> […] The result was even more surprising: “We could not calculate directions
> between split, croatia and zagreb, croatia.” […]

And the
[Belgrade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade)-[Podgorica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podgorica)
route:

> […] Closer inspection of the driving directions reveals the problem: Google
> wants us to head southeast for 150km, turn around, and drive back to the
> outskirts of Belgrade on the same road before finally taking the correct
> road towards Montenegro. […]

The author of _Balkanology Blog_ gave up at this point, but Stuart Pinfold –
the blogger who first discovered the confusion – shared some more results of
Google Maps destination searches in the comment section to this post.

**The Czech Republic**

\- _The Journeys of Captain Oddsocks_ [writes about the town of
Svitavy](http://captainoddsocks.blogspot.com/2008/10/schindlers-svitavy.html)
– which, among other things, is the birthplace of [Oscar
Schindler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler), the man “credited
with saving the lives of over 1000 Jewish people towards the end of World War
II”:

> […] The Schindler home is at Poličská Ul. 24 but is still a family residence
> and therefore inaccessible to the public. It’s marked only by a small stone
> memorial in the park across the street.
>
> […]
>
> One block south of the main square, the [Svitavy city
> museum](http://www.muzeum.svitavy.cz/permanent-exhibitions/oskar-
> schindler/131-2/) dedicates an entire wing to the story of Schindler and his
> Jews. Most of the displays take the form of documents and photographs and
> are neatly displayed in white on black panels. There are also several items
> exhibited in glass cases – prisoners’ uniforms, identity cards, food stamps
> and so on […].

[In another post](http://captainoddsocks.blogspot.com/2008/11/abc-czech-
tourist-information-123.html), _Captain Oddsocks_ writes about his “love/hate
relationship” with “tourist information offices in the Czech Republic” and
offers some tips on how “to make sure their visitors, however few or many,
have such a wonderful stay that they want to go away and spread the word
without being asked”:

> […] I say that because I think, even though foreign tourists have been
> coming here freely for almost 20 years, the **Czech Republic remains
> drastically underrated and underappreciated**. Most people only go to
> **Prague**. […]

**Latvia**

\- Latvian photographer Arnis Balcus posts [photos of Latvia's oldest movie
theater](http://balcus.blogspot.com/2008/10/kino-riga.html), _Rīga_ , founded
in 1923:

> […] It is probably also the only cinema in the country that still hires an
> artist to paint film ads.

**Poland**

\- _Polandian_ [writes](http://polandian.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/the-pontiff-
plague/) about the fast-growing population of [Pope John Paul
II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II) statues in Poland:

> […] There are now 228 known public statues of Jan Pawel in Poland (this guy
> keeps a record). The Pope only died three years ago. According to a
> calculation I just pretended to do, if the production of Pope statues
> continues at this rate there will be more marble John Pauls than actual
> Polish people by about 2025. […]
>
> […]
>
> Kitsch is the word that springs, unfortunately, to mind. You have to wonder
> what John Paul would have thought of all this idolatry, and you have to
> conclude that it wouldn’t have been positive. […]

\- _20 east_ [explores Warsaw
landmarks](http://scatts.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/bruhl-palace-in-mlociny/)
connected to [Heinrich, count von
Brühl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich,_count_von_Br%C3%BChl) – the
palace at Saski Square and the palace in Młociny:

> […] We’ve walked past it many times but not ventured over the fence. The
> other weekend, I went out for a walk alone into the wilder parts of the
> neighbouring land and after working my way around a small lake and then up a
> steep slope I found myself standing face to face with the palace without
> having to deliberately break any boundaries. I imagined the place would be
> deserted but I think there’s a caretaker living in the north wing because I
> saw a tricycle parked there (visible in the next picture) and curtains in
> the windows. There’s a weird looking guy, about 45 years old, rides around
> the neighbourhood on a tricycle made for a 6 year old. I thought he was just
> the local mutant but it seems he might be the palace caretaker. […]

**Russia**

\- _Eagle and the Bear_ writes about “a strange assemblage of Soviet military
hardware” at Khodynka Field in Moscow –
[here](http://eagleandthebear.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/gettin-your-kicks-on-
soviet-jets/) and
[here](http://eagleandthebear.wordpress.com/2008/11/12/soviet-jets-part-ii/):

> […] Listen up, kids — this kind of thing doesn’t happen in America or
> Europe: A completely unsupervised collection of Soviet air power, Hinds and
> MIGs, relics that once hunted down Afghani goat-herders now at your disposal
> for war games and stupid pictures. […]

LJ user _akry_ has also [devoted several
posts](http://akry.livejournal.com/tag/%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%8B%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0)
(RUS) to Khodynka military hardware “cemetery” and [has posted over a hundred
photos](http://blog.alexkrylov.ru/photoalbumshow.php?albumid=1210380&seriesid=1204108)
taken there:

> […] We were shocked by what we saw there. The once mighty, beautiful
> machines have been left to rot under the rain, their blister windows broken,
> their insides sticking out… And these are the helicopters and aircrafts that
> used to protect us… […]

**Serbia**

\- _A Yankee-in-Belgrade_ writes about [the “long and tumultuous history” of
Serbia's capital](http://yankee-in-belgrade.blogspot.com/2008/11/skywatch-eye-
on-horizon.html):

> […] When the Scordisci (a Celtic tribe) set uptheir stronghold Singidunum at
> the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers in the third century, the city
> at the “crossroads of the worlds” had been already been conquered by the
> Byzantines, the Gepidae, the Sarmatians, the Eastern Goths, the Slavs, the
> Avars, the Francs, the Bulgarians, the Hungarians, the Ottomans, the
> Austrians, the Germans… each of whom gave the city their respective names:
> Singedon, Nandor, Fehervar, Nandor Alba, Alba Graeca, Grieschisch
> Weisenburg, Alba Bulgarica, Taurunum… However, its Slavic name Belgrade,
> meaning White City, has lasted the longest. […]

\- At the _Balkan Crew_ , GV author [Danica
Radovanovic](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/danica-radovanovic/) writes
about [places she loves best in Belgrade](http://balkan-
crew.blogspot.com/2008/11/four-favourite-things-in-belgrade.html):

> […] 2. Markets, open lively markets with food and other goods. Someone said
> that you have to go first to the open market when you visit some city in
> order to know better the soul of the city and its habitants, people who live
> there. […]
