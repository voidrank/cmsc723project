It's not exaggeration to say that the debate running mostly by the title
“Facebook vs iWiW” started a long time ago, with the registration of the first
user from Hungary on the social networking site founded by Mark Zuckerberg.
According to [Facebakers.com](http://www.facebakers.com/countries-with-
facebook/HU/), the number of Facebook users in Hungary is already 1,313,020
(with an online penetration of 22.15 %).

The Hungarian social networking site called [iWiW](http://www.iwiw.hu) (HUN),
an abbreviation for [International Who is
Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWiW), was launched in 2002, as

In 2006, [Hungarian Telecom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Telekom)
purchased iWiW, and by 2009, the site had 4 million registered users in a
country of ten million.

As in every “new” country where the popularity of Facebook started to grow,
the number of Hungarian users is increasing, too. Hírbehozó of [Webisztán
blog](http://www.webisztan.blog.hu) (HUN)
[reported](http://webisztan.blog.hu/2010/03/26/egymillio_magyar_a_facebookon)
(HUN) in March that the number of Hungarian users has reached one million:

> […] The reach of the psychological line in the case of a social networking
> service is not only a psychological advantage: it comes by the
> characteristics of these sites that they can move circles of acquaintances
> easily.
>
> For this the number of users it needs to reach a critical mass when
> everybody has acquaintances who use the service actively.
>
> Facebook has arrived to this level among Hungarian users. As it shows up
> from the data, by now there are some hundred thousand signing up in Hungary
> per month. And if this tendency didn't get better for some reason, still it
> would be very likely that at least by the end of the year almost every
> active Hungarian net user would be in touch with Facebook. […]

The blogger of _Webisztán_ admitted that Facebook is still not on the very top
of the country's top 100 ranking. According to
[Alexa.com](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/HU) the first is the
[Hungarian page](http://google.hu) of Google search, the second is
[YouTube](http://youtube.com) and the third is still a Hungarian social
networking site, [iWiW.hu](http://www.iwiw.hu) (HUN). Facebook's ranking is
only #5.

Doransky, who's dealing with online marketing,
[highlighted](http://doransky.hu/?p=1671) (HUN) the power of iWiW that makes
it different from Facebook:

> […] Is there any web service in which there's a competitive edge of a
> cultural code? If there is, then the service which is based on the value of
> social connections could be that. Since the budget is similarly low.
> Facebook makes a drastic conversion almost every two months, which derives
> from the fact that 700 people are working on the system. It's the number of
> employees at the customer service in any European country, but not a whole
> company running with minimal customer relations.
>
> The power of iWiW is still in the fact that you can find everyone and their
> uncle there from the web, it has a good friend search and it's good for
> exchanging information among people, which is totally enough for the
> majority.
>
> Unlike a search engine, this network can't be conquered so simply because
> it's comprised mostly of the people who feel the local specialties and they
> got used to iWiW.

nyero?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Doransky+\(Doransky\))
(HUN), he added how it is important for iWiW to start facing Faceboook:

> […] If they do not accelerate, they will slowly suffer the fate of those
> services that were killed by Facebook. This happens so frequently nowadays
> that after the founder Zuckerberg people started to use his name as a verb:
> Zucked!

Konrád Berényi, a consultant in online marketing, published a
[post](http://onlinemarketing.blog.hu/2010/05/27/harakiwiw) (HUN) titled
“Harakiwiw,” criticizing Telekom, the owner of iWiW, not supporting their
service in the competition for the Hungarian market of social networking
sites:

> […] But I can draw it more harshly: T-Mobile doesn't give a hoot about the
> competition going on at home in the social media market, it follows the
> international trends and supports Facebook, either doesn't care about
> anything else or doesn't want to. And this won't take a turn for the better.
> If iWiW came out with an offer from tomorrow on, it could only be a silent
> follower. Facebook is the star, everybody wants its shine, while iWiW is the
> poor orphan: _be-quiet_ , _go-sit-in-the-corner_ , _you-can-get-some-
> leftover_.
