Uprising Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Uprising_Day), observed on
March 10 every year, marks the violent crackdown in 1959 by Chinese
authorities after Tibetan protesters launched protest against their presence
in Tibet.

This year's anniversary observation in Nepal is already under tremendous
scrutiny from the authorities.
_[EverestJournal](http://www.everestjournal.com/tibet-anniversary-china-
nepal/)_ , a blog on Nepal tourism and environment, says that Nepalese
government is ready to stop any anti-China demonstrations in the country.

> “Determined to prevent anti-China demonstrations in Tibet Wednesday, the
> 51st anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese annexation,
> Beijing has snapped most links between the former Buddhist kingdom and its
> neighbor Nepal.
>
> The bridge connecting northern Nepal with Tibet – the Friendship Bridge –
> has been effectively closed by the Chinese authorities, rights body
> International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) said in a statement, while flights
> between Kathmandu and Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, have been grounded since
> Friday.”

Nepal's forceful approach towards the Tibet Uprising Anniversary and any
public program that may be organized by Tibetan refugees in the country is
attracting criticism from Tibetan & Nepali blogs.

_[TibetCustom](http://www.tibetcustom.com/article.php/20100308211546208) _says
that Nepal is falling “into the arms of China over Tibet “issue””:

> “The Nepalese government has adopted a hard line against expressions of
> Tibetan identity in Nepal, despite strong cultural and religious ties among
> the Himalayan peoples that have existed for centuries. Long-staying Tibetan
> refugees in Kathmandu and in settlements close to the Tibet-Nepal border are
> increasingly fearful as the Nepalese government relinquishes its historic
> and sovereign interests in response to incentivized political pressure from
> Beijing and its Nepalese sympathizers.
>
> Mary Beth Markey, Vice President of Advocacy of the International Campaign
> for Tibet, said: “These disturbing developments deserve an immediate
> response by the international community…..”

At influential Tibetan blog
_[Phayul](http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=26823&article=Nepal+detains+Tibetan+govt.+representative+ahead+of+senstive+uprising+day)_
, _Kalsang Rinchen_ reported on Nepalese government's decision to detain
Tibetan government's representative. _Rinchen_ describes the government's
decision as a deliberate move to “appease” the Chinese.

> “The Nepal government has recently launched hunt for “trouble makers”
> through surprise raids of hotels, restaurants and homes earlier last week
> reportedly under pressure from China that rewards the crisis stricken
> country with financial aid and military assistance. Several Tibetans have
> been reportedly taken under “preventive custody” ahead of Wednesday's

_Over The Top_ , the Blog of _Himal Magazine_ from Nepal
[informs](http://himalmag.com/blogs/blog/2010/03/10/to-all-the-tibetans-in-
exile-living-in-nepal/):

> A letter dated 8 March from the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Committee of
> Kathmandu, currently making its rounds in the community, makes the ominous
> allegation that the Nepali police have been going so far as to threaten some
> extremely dire consequences to the kinds of protests Kathmandu has seen in
> the past. In a stark warning to the community, the letter states that, in
> the areas deemed off limits to demonstrators, “the police may even resort to
> shoot[ing].” As news of arrests of Tibetan activists continue to trickle in,
> the accompanying photographs taken today around the valley indicate that the
> Nepali government will continue to channel the paranoia of Beijing.

This is not the first time Tibetan community in Nepal has come under
government's ire. There was a large scale violent crackdown in 2008 when
protest against China broke out in Kathmandu before the Summer Olympics in
Beijing.

A recent report in [Al Jazeera
English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MElxNM17fE&feature=player_embedded#)
characterized the incident as Nepal curtailing Tibetan community's free speech
rights, under pressure from China.

Focus on the Tibetan community in Nepal and neighboring India has however
failed to include growing division within the community on a very serious
issue-religious freedom. The Dalai Lama has [imposed a ban on worship of deity
Shugden](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2008/08/dorje-
shugden-dalai-lama-ban). This has divided the community as Shugden's believers
face hostility and suspicion.

As Nepal continues to put emphasis in building closer relationship with China,
its relationship with hundreds of Tibetan refugees scattered around the
country is bound get more strained in coming days. Anniversaries commemorating
events like 1959 uprising juts add extra pressure to the already difficult
situation.
