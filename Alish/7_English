Former Nepalese Prime Minister [Girija Prasad
Koirala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girija_Prasad_Koirala) passed away on
Saturday March 21st, after prolonged illness. He was an influential and
powerful presence in Nepalese politics, but was also often controversial and
polarizing figure.

Despite his sixty years long public life and five different terms as Nepalese
Prime Minister, Koirala's unreasonable ambitions for his daughter marred his
reputation.

Girija Koirala's inability to successfully govern, or his lack of management
skills was analyzed by [_Deepak Adhikari_
](http://blog.com.np/2006/04/26/importance-of-being-girija/)in an article
published back in 2006.

Due to his pivotal role in the country's peace process and ongoing efforts to
write a new Constitution, Koirala's untimely death has attracted international
attention and concerns too.
[India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Koiralas-death-will-slow-
down-peace-process-in-Nepal/articleshow/5709227.cms) seems especially
concerned. [United States ](http://www.nepalnews.com/main/index.php/news-
archive/2-political/4883-us-japan-salute-late-koirala.html)also re-iterated
that true tribute to Koirala will be to finalize the new constitution and to
accelerate the peace process.

_Uttam Babu Shrestha_ at [_MySansar_
](http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2010/03/id/9886)says that void left by
Koirala's demise has put Nepal's peace process in a tough spot. Those who in
the past criticized Koirala's inability provide strong leadership are faced
with the challenge of directing the peace process to a positive conclusion.

There is no doubt that Girija Koirala's demise has left a big void in Nepalese
politics. His presence will be missed in the coming days as the political
parties struggle to complete new constitution writing process within
stipulated time. The debate over his legacy and his history of ineffective
management will drag on. He was a politician after all and no one in public
life has been able to escape public scrutiny-not even after death.
