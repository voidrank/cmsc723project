It's been a whirlwind [week of weird
weather](http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Middle-East-Hit-By-

for much of the Levant, as relieving rains and surprise snows blanket the
landscape. In the Syrian capital, the streets are covered with snow for the
first time in years. Though the Damascus skies occasionally sprinkle snow,
rarely does it stick to the ground. One blogger, _50% Syrian_ , is
[thrilled](http://halfsyrian.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/syrians-flipped-over-
their-robes-to-ask-for-rain/) by the development:

> For most young Damascenes (20s, early 30s), this is the very first time in
> their life that they see it snow in Damascus. A report I just read says it’s
> been 25 years since it last snowed in this beautiful city of spirit and
> soul. But according to my father-in-law he saw it snow around 50 years ago…
> and doesn’t remember seeing snow on the streets of the Syrian capital, ever
> since.
>
> Before settling in this city I most cherish and adore, I have been in and
> out of Damascus during many seasons, but this is the first time in my
> 30-something life that I see snow fluff down from the sky, so serenely and
> beautifully, filling me with hope and love, more than anything else.

_Why so Syria?_ describes herself as a Mexican-American in Damascus by way of
Boston. For that reason, she was especially surprised to wake up to snow
flurries. The blogger
[writes](http://web.me.com/waseemdaoud/WhySoSyria/Main_Page/Entries/2010/12/12_White_Christmas_in_Damascus_-
_SNOW!.html):

> Ok so Christmas is still a few days away but this morning we woke up to
> significant flurries in Damascus. What an unexpected and pleasant surprise!
> As I groggily opened my eyes and looked out the window, for a split second I
> thought I was still in Boston…
>
> …This city is always full of surprises. Just when you think you’ve got the
> place figured out, BAM — SNOW! It kind of blows my mind.

Syrian blogger _Ayman Ashour_ unfortunately missed the snowfall. He
[quips](http://kanaker.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1/):

نحن المحرومون من روعة البرد هدية الثلج الجميلة نناشدكم إرسال بعض الصورعلنا
نخفف من شدة احتجاج الأبناء علينا ومطالبتهم لنا بأن يلعبوا بالثلج مثلما لعبنا
به

Those of us who are deprived of the wonders of the cold and the beautiful gift
of snow are asking you to send us some photos so we could ease our children's
protests and demands of playing with snow as we once did.

A Syrian satellite television channel [shared a beautiful
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dGcoxDU8wz8) on
YouTube, illustrating the beauty of the Damascene snowfall:
