In recent weeks, the Costa Rican blogosphere has continued to discuss,
comment, and criticize the new Traffic Law, which went into effect the first
week of March. Many have expressed their dissatisfaction with some of the
items proposed in the new law.

Many do not agree with the stiffer financial penalties for those committing
infraction of the new law. In addition, [there were also not many reductions
in penalties, as had been
hoped.](http://www.elpregon.org/costarica/politica/2335-multas-no-bajaron-en-
articulos-varios-de-la-nueva-ley-de-transito) The increased fines will mean
more money for the Ministry of Revenue, politicians, as well as for the
traffic police. Nacho of _Media Blog [es]_

Some of these laws are good. However, the majority are just plain stupid, and
only serve so that the traffic cops are more corrupt and charge money for not
giving tickets, and they charge money so that the congressional deputies can
go around in luxury cars on the backs of the poor and not to be spent on the
ALLEYS that we have for streets.

In addition, many drivers do not see how traffic cops can enforce the law,
when they themselves violate traffic laws. The blogger at _Conejitos Suicidas
[es]_ published [a video made by YouTube user
Carlossave](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1Tk0c-eJBY&feature=player_embedded),
who recorded himself following a police officer traveling at a high rate of
speed.

Another area of concern with the new Traffic Law is that it has allowed an
increased level of blood alcohol for drivers. Because now a drunk driver, who
is first-timer, would not go to jail in the event that there are no injuries
or property damage. Haroldo Rivas of _Harol's Blog [es]_
[writes](http://www.harolsblog.com/2010/03/conductores-borrachos-y-leyes-de-

Yesterday, ladies and gentlemen (after yelling at one another like the most
common person in the world) agreed that the first-time drunk driver would not
go to jail even for however macabre are their actions, in addition to
increasing the blood-alcohol level allowed, they do so to protect themselves
because they are the same protagonists in the same scenario. When will they
begin to work with the people's safety in mind and for their own comfort or
money? Shame on you…

Due to this uncertainty, the main questions from Costa Ricans are whether this
law will work property in the country and whether its results will be a
benefit for its citizens. Mae Moto of the blog _Caballeros de la Luz [es]_

But the question is, does it really serves the above (referring to the full
paper written in his blog on the new Law on Traffic: to improve the situation
on our saturated roads? In my humble opinion, this reform to the Traffic Act
is completely a farce, and a way to get money from the middle class, who will
always be the worst enemy of the rich class.

This confirms the insecurity and distrust that Costa Ricans have of the new
laws created in our country, in this case the Traffic Law. As it has been the
main topic of discussion of the various blogs of Costa Rica, it been good for
people to have this space to express what they feel and want to say about the
decisions that affect the citizens.
