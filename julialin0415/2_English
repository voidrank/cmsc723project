Stilt fishing in the evening light—a unique tourist attraction in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has been a [popular tourist
destination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Sri_Lanka) for
centuries, and tourism is a key source of revenue and a driver for local
economy. The [Sri Lankan Civil
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War), which spanned more
than 25 years and ended in 2009, naturally hurt the country's tourism, keeping
the industry stagnate.

Tourism has been [rising
rapidly](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/end-of-sri-lankas-civil-
war-brings-back-tourists-1773082.html) ever since the end of the war, however.
Among many new developments, the Sri Lankan government is implementing a major
4,000-acre [tourism development
project](http://cyberspaceandtime.com/Kalpitiya_Dutch_Bay_Resort_Sri_Lanka_Tourism_Development_Project/JXYS49hIeGw.video)
175 kilometers north of the capital Colombo at
[Kalpitiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpitiya), which is revered for its
scenic beauty.

[Raisa Wickrematunge](http://groundviews.org/2016/09/27/paradise-lost-the-
hidden-costs-of-tourism-development-in-sri-lanka/) writes in Groundviews that
more than a [million](http://www.sltda.lk/node/745) tourists visited Sri Lanka
between January and August this year alone. This is an industry that provides
thousands of people with jobs, either directly or indirectly.

There is evidence, however, that locals are being denied work in the tourism
industry on a systematic basis. Wickrematunge
[found](https://spark.adobe.com/page/JDNqBSkQtIEkb/) several local people who
say they were not allowed to work for tour companies. In some cases,
individuals weren't even allowed to offer their own services directly to
tourists, such as boating and hospitality services. Indeed many hotels—both
private facilities and those owned by the armed forces—refuse to employ local
workers.

The Sri Lankan military, incidentally, is [investing heavily in the tourism
business](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2013/08/sri_lankan_army_goes_into_tourism_business_after_crushing_the_tamil_tigers.html).
The armed forces have several hotels and resorts, many restaurants and cafes,
and other tourist facilities.

[According](http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/10/tourism-sri-lanka-
threatened-military-declining-accountability/) to a recent report by Global
Risk Insights, the military is using [press-
ganged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_gang) soldiers receiving
negligible wages to staff resort and entertainment venues owned by the army. A
report by Society for Threatened Peoples, titled “[Dark Clouds Over The
Sunshine Paradise](http://srilankabrief.org/2015/03/toursim-and-human-rights-
in-sri-lankadark-clouds-over-the-sunshine-paradise/),” found that the military
secures lucrative additional income through the tourism sector by employing
members of the military in tourism, which allows it to beat competitors’
prices in the private sector.

Out of every tourist dollar spent in Sri Lanka, a [significant portion
goes](https://www.tourism-watch.de/en/content/after-civil-war-sri-lanka-
relies-tourism) to funding the military, which critics say is grossly
oversized and lacks a raison d’être after the end of civil war. Instead of
demilitarization, as many as 200,000 troops remain stationed in the Tamil-
populated north—nearly [one soldier for every ten
civilians](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2013/08/sri_lankan_army_goes_into_tourism_business_after_crushing_the_tamil_tigers.html).

The rapid development of tourism has also led to other problems. The new
tourism initiatives by the military and private companies are depriving many
local populations of their traditional lands, most seriously affecting
community life and cultures in places like Kuchchaveli, Passikudah, Kalpitiya,
Jaffna (in the Northern Province), and Panama (in the Ampara district of the
Eastern Province).

[Yves Bowie](http://groundviews.org/2015/06/23/tourism-mega-development-in-
sri-lanka-results-in-human-rights-violations/) at Groundviews shares a few
stories from these local communities:

> Kuchchaveli is a small fishing village in the north-east of Sri Lanka. The
> people are mostly engaged in fishing and agriculture. At the end of the war,
> a lot of land in Kuchchaveli was occupied by the Sri Lankan Navy. The
> villagers had to leave their own homes, their farms, and their fishing
> areas. After the end of the war they wanted to return to their land but the
> Navy did not leave.

> The villagers in Passikudah area are mostly fishermen and their families.
> They have been fishing in this area for generations. After the hotels were
> built most of them had to leave their workplaces. The boat fishermen were
> sent to a very small place in the corner of the bay, which they also might
> have to leave soon. They are under a big risk of losing their livelihood.

Also at Groundviews, [Ruki Fernanda and Herman
Kumar](http://groundviews.org/2016/07/11/tourism-in-sri-lanka-catalyst-for-
peace-development-or-militarization-dispossession/) write:

> Tourism must be centered on local populations and war affected peoples.
