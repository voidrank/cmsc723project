While Chinese authorities remain [weaselly](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-
robinson/myanmars-monks-show-the-_b_65994.html) in their diplomatic response
to Myanmar's fatal clampdown on the tens of thousands of monks and citizens of
Yangon who have come out to rally for an end to the military dictatorship, a
number of influential Chinese bloggers have taken the radical move of going
against [all known truths regarding The Chinese Mind as of Sept. 17,
2007](http://www.chinaherald.net/2007/09/why-democracy-does-not-work-tom.html)
with some throwing their weight squarely behind [the Saffron
Revolution](http://ratchasima.net/saffron-revolution/) and others even using
this incident as an opportunity to reflect on the state of China's own
democratic movement.

Wednesday morning when the Chinese blogsphere began to respond to news of [the
growing protest](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/09/25/myanmar-voices-
from-the-region/) and [subsequent
crackdown](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/09/26/myanmar-updates-
from-26-september/) was when the first [Bullog](http://bullog.cn)—an
independent blog portal home to many prominent Chinese journalists’
blogs—blogger Don Ma posted the first of his several updates on the situation
with [‘different government, same old
line,’](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/drunkortobe/archives/108666.aspx) a
response to the junta's claim of instigation from both domestic and foreign
enemies. “All dictatorships think the same way,” writes one reader; “[Li
Hongzhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi)” jokingly (?) blurts
another. [A further
update](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/drunkortobe/archives/108695.aspx) from Ma
closer to noon that the Myanmar military had begun cracking down on the monks
received no response.

Bullog blogger and historian Fu Guoyong posted not long before lunch on
Wednesday [an
essay](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/fuguoyong/archives/108846.aspx) he'd written
on [Aung San Suu Kyi](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi) back in 2002 in
which he puts forth some ethical guidelines for China's own democratic
movement, and without naming names, perhaps referring to those currently
([housebound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Zhisheng) and
[imprisoned](http://zonaeuropa.com/20050529_1.htm) parallels nonwithstanding)
involved in it.

One of Fu's readers writes:

> 昂山淑姬……丧失理想的中国何时才能有这种“圣徒”般的人物？

Aung San Suu Kyi….when will ideal-less China ever have such a “saint” of her
own?

Writes another:

> 为何不期待自己成为这样的人物？

Why do you rule out yourself becoming just such a figure?

Coincidentally, a search on YouTube for
[缅甸](http://www.nciku.com/EntryDetailView.php?entry_id=27432&dictype=2) brings
up two recent cellphone-shot clips from the streets of
[Yangon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangoon), the latter having been posted
by a [‘yongfuguo’](http://youtube.com/user/yongfuguo):

By noon Thursday, other Bullog bloggers began kicking in. Blog editor for
major internet news portal NetEase Wen Yunchao [posted two
photos](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/wenyunchao/archives/109056.aspx) under the
title [borrowed from People's
Daily](http://sc.people.com.cn/news/HTML/2007/9/24/20070924144326.htm): ‘two
photos of anti-authoritarianism':

> 9月23日，缅甸仰光，大约2万名僧侣和市民走上街头，反对军事独裁。  
>  人民网的报道称这场运动是“反对军事独裁”：

Yangon, Myanmar, September 23, roughly 20,000 monks and citizens walk through
the streets in opposition to the military dictatorship. The People's Daily
online report [is referring to this
movement](http://sc.people.com.cn/news/HTML/2007/9/24/20070924144326.htm) as
“anti-military dictatorship”.

Some comments:

> 我们物价上涨的时候……

When our commodity prices go up…..

> follow monks

I'm with the monks

> 已经开枪了

They've already started shooting

> 震撼,感动!  
>  啥也不说了……

Shocking! Exciting!  
I'm not gonna say anything…..

[Indispensable](http://www.danwei.org/internet/secrets_out_in_the_open.php)
_ProState inFlames_ blogger and _[The Beijing
News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing#Press)_ reporter moogee made his
first post of several just after lunch Thursday with [a
translation](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/moogee/archives/109080.aspx) of a
Myanmar Daily editorial which dismisses the protests as the actions of an
extremely small rumor-spreading and reactionary minority instigated by
reactionary Western forces, manipulating and encouraging people to violate the
constitution and attack the government, the military and the whole of society
with the aim of throwing the country into chaos; the editorial adds that the
government also hopes to see an end to corruption, the promotion of democracy,
that in fact it's these illegal groups out protesting who are working against
such goals…

Two translatable comments from the many caustic and sarcastic others left on
this post:

> 好熟悉的文字

Those are some familiar-looking words

> 真他妈比的有意思  
>  全世界的独裁专制统治者，说起话来，强调和语气都完全一摸一样  
>  日他娘的比

Really [bleep] interesting  
Autocrats and dictators the world over, everything they say, what they
emphasize and even their tone, it's all exactly the same  
[bleep][bleep][bleep]

A few hours after another post from Don Ma responding to news that monks and
citizens were being attacked—[“sure enough, the Communist Party of China
government won't interfere with another country's domestic
politics”](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/drunkortobe/archives/108998.aspx)—moogee
[added](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/moogee/archives/109112.aspx) that:

> 和尚情绪稳定，开枪的都是临时军人

The monks are keeping calm; those shooting are all [temporary
soldiers](http://jenbrea.typepad.com/africabeat/2007/09/africans-beaten.html)

Reader comments:

> 不知道仰光的路况能不能支持住坦克…..

I don't know if Yangon's roads can hold up to tanks…..

> 党太虚伪了，当年没有日本人干涉内政，他们有今天。对自己是自由主义，对别人是专职主义的垃圾。

The Party's too full of it. If the Japanese hadn't interfered in our domestic
politics back in the day, the Party wouldn't even be here. Now it's liberalism
for themselves, and autocracy for everyone else.

> 缅甸的和尚还算对得起自己的信仰  
>  另一方面也反应缅甸的专制还不成熟  
>  我们共产中国老早就专辟了一个“宗教事务局”，一网打尽佛道僧尼上帝安拉……  
>  有时候我想，如果要我一边信仰一个神，一边服从宗教事务局的领导，我真会害怕自己下地狱。

At least Myanmar's monks are able to keep their own faith  
But at the same time it just shows how unripe Myanmar's totalitarianism is  
Here in Communist China we've had a “Religious Affairs Bureau” set up for
ages, which rounds up the whole lot of various religions…..  
Sometimes I think that if I was to believe in one god, but then obey the RAB's
leaders as well, I'd be really scared of going to hell.

Later in the afternoon moogee
[reposted](http://www.bullog.cn/blogs/moogee/archives/109114.aspx) one
netizen's strongly-worded demand for China to immediately dispatch troops to
Myanmar and restore order, generating two pages of heated and fascinating
debate in comments over this issue; Sina blogger Yan Nanfei put out [a post at
five pm](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_42a9c85a01000al6.html) that the
authorities had begun using tear gas to stop the procession, and then the
Paparazzi Brigade ycul blogger [put
out](http://gzddwsj.yculblog.com/post.1771747.html) at just before nine:

Is there any way to stop the killing?

The Myanmar situation is spreading like wildfire, the whole world is watching  
And now mainland media have clearly gone dead silent, like nothing were
happening in our neighboring country at all.  
There have been reports all over on the latest developments of the situation,
but I've yet to see anything in-depth.  
What's the connection between the monks and the democrats? Why were the monks
the first to get out and start protesting?  
Who's behind all this?  
Rising oil prices ignited this, but what's the conflict at the lower levels in
Myanmar society?

What's China, standing in the middle, doing about this?  
Every country is watching to find out.  
China's worried about the impact this will have on its international image  
As well as negative impact on the '08 Olympics  
Just like where China has fallen short in the Darfur humanitarian crisis  
Leading some countries to boycott the Olympics
