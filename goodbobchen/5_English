In order to stop the spreading panic, most of the detailed recounts of what is
happening in Tibet are filtered out; however, a few blogs have survived to
report what had happened at the frontline.

In the propaganda sparring, each side has shown their best skills to stand
their positions by the name of “people” on their banners. But given the
records of people who have in person witnessed the violence and anti-violence
by the means of crackdown, it's the thousands of commons who were hurled into
a sea of infinite fear.

> 在我个人看来，此次事件策划非常圆满，从3月10号开始，拉萨周边寺庙的喇嘛尼姑就入城集会闹事，被迅速驱散（市中心大昭寺广场，数十名僧人举藏独的雪山狮子旗呼喊独立口号，两分钟内被抓捕）。之后，拉萨大批警力被派往寺庙周围，城内警力有限。到了14号上午10点，开始有人围攻市区内小昭寺外执勤警察，迅速演化为暴力行为，全城开花。可以说是非常漂亮的声东击西。

I personally think the riot is quite successfully planned. Since 10 March,
monks and nuns around Lhasa have entered downtown to protest, but were soon
dispelled. Then, great hordes of police were sent to around the temples at
suburb, thus the force available in city was limited. On 14th, 10 am, some
started to siege the police outside the Xiaozhao Temple in the city, and the
action soon turned into violence. The whole city was then thrown into the
insurgence. A very pretty feint.

> 14
> 号白天，在骚乱地点是见一个汉人就杀，死亡数据是封锁了的。但在14日晚九点，我同事的爱人在公安厅，当时透露了一个数据，汉族平民死亡大概在一百七八十左右，之后就没有数据了。拉萨各医院住满了伤亡者（我在报社的朋友去医院采访，亲眼见到5个失去了耳朵的伤者，还有一具被点了”天灯”女尸），武警总医院是隔几分钟就抬入一个受伤战士（因为白天不能动武，只靠人墙去挡）。顺便，可以告诉你两例真实的暴行：一是三名藏族男子追上一汉族女子，每人一刀；另一是以纯专卖店的5位花季店员，汽油瓶丢入，卷帘门拉下，被活活烧死。

On the day of 14th, (mobs) killed every Han they met at where the riot was
going. But the overall death toll was unreleased. However, my colleague’s
spouse who worked in Public Security department told that about 170 Hans died.
Then there was no more statistics. Hospitals in Lhasa were crowded with the
injured. My friend working in newspaper office has been there and saw in
person 5 people lost their ears and one body of a female burnt to death. In
the police hospital, every a few minutes an armed police was sent in, as in
daytime they could not crackdown by force but could just stopped the mob with
flesh wall.  
By the way, I can tell you 2 cases of real violence: 3 Tibetans caught up a
Han girl and each gave her a knife stab; another case —– 5 young salespeople
were kept in a shop, door shuttered up and gas bottles thrown in. They were
burnt to death.

> 14号夜间，对于冲击武警的，已经可以开枪了。15号凌晨5点（拉萨在西部，此时还是黑夜），军队进城，同时有40多辆轮式装甲车进入。15号15点（在拉萨，这个时间相当于天津13点），三十余辆履带式装甲车入城（对于所有汉族人，振奋人心）；同时，15号开始入户搜捕。16号22点，履带式装甲车撤出，局势基本控制，但仍有零星事件。现在17号11时，我们正常上班。

On 14th, the police were allowed to shoot at those who strike them. At 5 am,
15th, the army drove in with 40 wheeled armor cars. (That inspired us Han).
And on 15th the police broke in homes for search. On 22; 00, 16th, the pedrail
tanks withdrew, situation under control. But pieces of violence still existed.
At 11 am, 17th, we were back to work.

The whole afternoon was spent in panic. For a while we heard that armored cars
had showed up…. for another while it’s said tanks came too, and then smoke
rising at around Xiaozhao Temple. I dared not go out, and had no idea what’s
happening outside. There was all noise —– screaming, guffaws, sound of
chasing, 120 (emergency medical call) for twice and something blown up.

> 晚饭还好，有中午剩下的菜汤，再加点菜，居然很香！吃饭时发现多了好多人，一共十几个人吧，哪冒出这么多的人？奇怪？还有两个四川人，好像受伤了

The dinner, some soup left from lunch plus a few more dishes, is fine. It
tasted so good! When at table I found quite more people, over 10 totally.
Where did they come up? So strange. And there were 2 men from Sichuan, who
seemed injured. The men said they hurdled the wall and observed the situation
for quite a long time before skipping down to our yard. I was not sure if they
were exactly the men beaten up howling when at dusk. We were so scared too,
speechless, daring not to open the door for the fear that the thugs would
broke in on hearing we are Han. I am too frightful to imagine that.

I phone a Wenzhou girl staying at Pingchuo Youth Hotel for regard. She said
the place was out of power. The only little food could be bought was so dear.
She saw the doors of Pingchuo burnt at noon and so did the door of a bank
nearby. The hotel owner was keeping watch downstairs and she was also scared.
I comforted her for a while and ringed off. Actually I was scared no less.

> 和我们一起的有游客，有在拉萨投资的，当然还有这家主人，大家表面上都不说，可是我相信大家心里都很怕！很 很怕！很很很怕！
> 这逃进来的两个人中其中一个告诉我们，他的摩托车被烧了，车上有现金两万元人民币和无数帐单……我们当时就告诉他，人没事才是最重要的！他们被打劫了，
> 身上的钱也被抢了，而且，被打得好惨，进到我们这里，脸都是惨白的……虽然我没和他们在一起，听到他们说这些，仍然觉得，有政府各部门的关爱真是一件非常幸福的事情！假设这个时候没有政府在保护，我们这些待在拉萨的人们，是怎样的一番场景？

Staying with us were tourists, investors in Lhasa, and of course the owner of
the house. Though no one spoke it out, I was sure every one of us was very
scared. Very very very scared!  
One of the two found here a shelter said his motor was burnt along with the
20000 RMB cash and bills on it…. We told them it’s the personal safety that
matters!  
They were robbed and beaten up, faces pale.  
Though I had not been with them at the time, when hearing this I still thought
how lucky to have the care from the government. Imagine what would have
happened then without the protection of the government? What would we staying
in Lhasa be?

Two nights ago my husband marched to Tibet, and I know nothing about where he
is now. The cell phone must have been out of power, contact lost. Qiu told
that they were demanded to reach within 3 days. They should be there now.  
Gloomy…. I hadn’t read news a few days ago until my husband said he would go
to Tibet. But it seemed to have nothing to do with our life. Well, now
everything is different. My husband was sent to Qinghai to protect Tibet,
exactly on the early morning of my birthday, a time He should have been here.

> 就在他们出发的那天下午—还不知道要去，去买了戒指项链等东西，总共有一万六七吧，不过还好花了7000。要不我肯定有的心疼好长一阵子了。给他也买
> 了不过好像也不是特别合适但是晚上他就出发了，现在也没有办法去换，只有等到回来了再去。我的戒指也稍有一点大，可是他那没有这个款了，而且这个还是铂金
> 镶的VVS级别的钻，应该说是很不错的，换一个可能就不会有这么好了吧。  
>  下午去跟妈妈逛乐逛，看了看婚纱，水分还是挺大的，有一个老板要500多，后来直接跟我们说不到300，应该还能便宜。

> 这两天晚上一个人也不想睡觉，看电视到困的不想看了抱着枕头倒头便睡，不习惯没有他的日子，不习惯没有人陪，希望他们在外边一切顺顺利利，能够照顾好自己，也不知道给他带的衣服会不会冷，笨蛋的我还是忘了给他带洗发水了，怎么洗头发呀？  
>  期望西藏早点安定，盼望老公早点回来  
>  祝福西藏，祝福老公！

On the day they set off —– we didn’t know it then—- we did shopping for rings
and necklace. It’s good that we just spent about 7000 or I have to be sorry
for the money for quite a while. I bought some for him too, but it doesn’t fit
very well. However, we had no chance to ask for a change now. I have to wait
until he is back.  
These two nights I don’t feel like to sleep until the TV shows made me
extremely sleepy to midnight. So unaccustomed to the days without him, without
a companion.  
Hope they can be fine outside, take good care of themselves, and I don’t know
if they’ll suffer cold with the clothes I sent. How stupid that I forgot to
bring him shampoo. How could he wash hair?  
Wish a peaceful Tibet coming soon, wish my husband coming soon.  
Blessing on Tibet, on my husband!
