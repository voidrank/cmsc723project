**Shoes thrown at a leader, but not G.W Bush this time**

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was [greeted by a shoe thrown at
him](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7865868.stm) during his
speech in Cambridge University, England. The lecture was about [building
harmonic](http://news.163.com/09/0203/00/516J43NG0001124J.html) international
relations.

The protester hurled a shoe at Wen, yelling, “How can the university
prostitute itself with this dictator? How can you listen to these lies?” He
then blew the whistle, and was shortly removed by security. The London Times
described him as a “young, Western-looking man with dark hair”, a possible
pro-Tibet or human rights activist.

Wen came back to his lecture soon, commenting on what happened: “this
despicable behavior cannot stand in the way of friendship between China and
the U.K.”

Wen's speech in Cambridge is one part of his 5-day European visit. The trip is
considered an effort to repair the relationship with Europe which was damaged
by Tibet riots and protests during the Olympic torch relays. On the other
hand, with a stable and strong, though slightly slowed economic growth, China
is trying to exert its influence and signal friendship in a time of global
financial crisis.

Wen's lecture is also a call against protectionism, which may greatly
undermine China's export-oriented economy. Wen has criticized the U.S and some
enterprises for the cause of the crisis, blaming them as irresponsible and
immoral.

France is not on the Wen's visit schedule. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French
president, met with the Dalai Lama last year, which was considered a
particularly unfriendly action by Chinese.

Protests accompanied Wen during his visit, most of them concerning issues
about Tibet.

**Pissed off by the shoe**

Unlike the way many Americans reacted to their former president Mr. Bush's
embarrassment in Iraq, it seems that this time the shoe thrown to Wen has
really pissed off a great many people.

In Xiaonei, the Chinese copy of facebook, a post named [“Britain, do you still
wanna
play?”](http://blog.xiaonei.com/GetEntry.do?id=358755463&owner=248936387)
showed up shortly after the incident. It aggregates a few furious comments.

F–k Tibet-separatists, I'd go fighting with you jerks if I had known I had no
class today. Let's see who has more shoes. Don't ever forget that the shoes
that flew at Bush are both made in China.

In [DWnews](http://app1.dwnews.com/comment2/postcomment.php?newsid=4705447),
an independent media publication, someone, obviously reminded of Bush,
commented:

> 没有创意。

No creativity.

And another netizen followed:

> 呼吁人肉搜索，把肇事者暴露出来！

Call for human flesh search engine, find the man out!

On Youtube, the video gathered a group of comments written in both English and
Chinese.

[guanchyun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ_50VrLUBo) applauded for Wen

> 没给中国人丢脸，牛﻿

You don't lose face for Chinese, cool!

[qujiahe](http://www.youtube.com/user/qujiahe) felt sorry for Wen

> 这么慈祥一老头都被扔鞋，剑桥那哥们脑子坏了么﻿

Even so benign an old man was thrown by a shoe. The guy in Cambridge has his
brain going wrong?

But [Jianghua2](http://www.youtube.com/user/Jianghua2) replied to the comment
above:

And in Xiaonei, not everyone is so much indignant. User

commented on the news:

> 难道只能布什给人扔鞋子，轮到温家宝就气愤了？

So only can Bush be thrown with shoes? And when it's Wen's turn, we turn out
to be so furious?

> 另外温家宝那番话讲得也太官话，这样都热烈鼓掌？怀疑剑桥里面都是些什么人……

And Wen's reply to the incident is all too official. Even clap for this? I
doubt who are those in Cambridge.

Regardless of how the internet and overseas media react to the shoe, however,
the state-media covered up the news determinedly. In discussion boards and
blog servers, also, nothing related to the incident can be found. It seems as
if the shoe has never been thrown in this harmonic world.

Follow-up: After a short time of black-out, the authority is likely to [have
approved the report on the incident
](http://news.163.com/09/0203/20/518N4TGG0001124J.html)on Chinese media. The
delay can be interpreted as a necessary time for the top officials to assess
the situation and public opinion, in order to determine in what way the story
be told.
