With the presence of thousands of armed police, Urumqi, the capital of
Xinjiang province, has largely restored order and people are [returning to
their normal life](http://news.163.com/09/0710/01/5DQU44HG000120GU.html). [The
violence that has led to 156 death
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/06/china-urumqi-mass-incident-and-
beyond/comment-page-2/#comments)in past a few days seemed to be gone, but the
images of the brutal killings haunted people's mind across the country.

Although the official media keeps appealing for national and ethnic
solidarity, the pictures and coverage of the riot presented to most Chinese
indicate it is nothing but a hate crime directed at Han Chinese by Uygur
gangs. Furious at that scores of innocent people were killed, Chinese netizens
are calling for a tough response to what they think is exactly a terrorist
attack.

Kukumusic[ told what he
heared](http://club.backchina.com/main/viewthread.php?tid=777519&extra=) from
his friend in Urumqi. In his eyes, he saw no so-called ‘peaceful protest’ by
Uygurs but only brutal butchers:

>
> 早上起来终于联系到了一个在乌市的哥们儿，很高兴他还活着（不是开玩笑），后来说到了乌市的现况，他跟我说了点那边动乱的细节，和现在网上论坛里报道的有些不同，一起说出来吧。  
>  维族人在大街上见到汉族人就上去割喉，分成7、8人一组，杀了汉人后，5秒钟就散开，走在路上，常看见躺着很多具尸体。  
>
> 暴乱的维族人都是生活在贫困线下的维族，据说被境外收买后，实施暴动行为。有一些维族人已经到了丧心病狂的地步，有直接把人从天桥上往下扔，更狠的是有些维族普通老百姓也受到牵连，也被他们错打。

In the morning I finally reached to my friend in Urumqi. Glad that he was
still alive (no joking). We talked about the riot, which he revealed to me a
lot more details different from what I have seen on the internet.  
Uygur gangs rushed to every Han Chinese they saw and cut their throats in
groups of 7 and 8. After the murder, they dispersed in 5 seconds. Walking
along the street, he can see dead bodies around.  
The rioters are those living in poverty. It is said they were manipulated by
foreign organizers to carry out the violent killings. Some Uygurs are just
crazy that they threw people straight from the bridge. More violently, they
even mistakenly slaughtered their own people.

In EastSouthWestNorth.com, [a number of witness
accounts](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20090706_1.htm) were translated into
English, along with bloody pictures. The people injured, judged from their
appreance, are most Han Chinese.

The brutal killings obviously provoked many netizens. Therefore, on the
internet the call for a tough strike-back is prevailing. Some even complained
the government is too soft.

I have just called my brother working in Urumqi. It can be felt that Han
Chinese there are very discontent of the government's performance during the
riot.  
1\. They were not well protected. They don't believe in the government. When
the terrorists killed and robbed there are no armed police (perhaps the
government underestimated the situation). But when the Han Chinese marched on
street, there were helicopters, armed police and tear gas to stop us.  
2\. The harmonious ethnic relationship in our company turned tense. As long as
people saw the scenes that Han were viciously killed, I am afraid they would
no longer feel kind of Uygurs. It is a very serious problem.

The harm by the riot to both Uygurs and Han Chinese in Xinjiang is destined to
be far-reaching. No one would forget the battle-field-like, horrible killings
happened in Urumqi.

A journalist[ noted down what he
experienced](http://www.1688.com.au/site1/news/headline/2009/07/08/152953.shtml)
after the interview of Uygur women protesting for their missing husbands and
sons who are said to be arrested:

> 当记者结束採访赛马场维族妇女示威后，约过了20分钟，好不容易找到的士返回酒店，车子刚行驶约10分
> 钟途经大湾北路时，经验丰富的汉族的士司机感觉前面气氛不对，急忙停车说，不能再走这条路了。记者不解其意，问他「为什麽不走？」仅过了1分钟，就见前面

> 司机见状急忙掉头，四周汽车纷纷转向，一时间交通秩序大乱。Mitbbs.com  
>
> 记者从未经历如此紧张场面，只见路上行人朝同一个方向奔跑….车子至一个交叉路口刚要转弯，车后忽有女人拼命拍打车尾，急呼「帮帮忙，我跑不动了」，好心的司机停车让她上车，  
>
> 一行人脱险后，记者反问司机﹕「刚才情景好像在伊拉克打仗，要这样紧张吗？」司机回答说，「你没经历过当时惨景，那些维族暴徒连妇女小孩都不放过，被他们撞到能有好结果吗？」

20 minutes after the interview, I finally got a taxi back to hotel. 10
minustes later, when the taxi passed by Dawan N Road, the experienced Han
driver felt something wrong and stopped the car, saying ‘we can't go this
way’. I wondered what happened. But 1 minute later I saw a crowd running up to
us as if a pouring rain was coming, some yelling ‘Run, something is going on
ahead’. I looked that way and found a gang of Uygurs has blocked the street. I
heared windows crashed. The driver turned away immediately with all other
cars. The traffic is chaotic.  
I have never seen such a tension. All people ran to the same direction. When
our taxi was about to turn, a woman flapped on the window shouting, ‘I can't
run anymore, help!’ We stopped to let her in.  
When we got out of the danger, I asked the driver, ‘It was just like a war in
Iraq. Do we have to be so?’ The driver said, ‘You don't know about that. Those
gangs don't even let women and girls go. Nothing good would happen if they
capture you’.

Many Han Chinese are grieved to see that, the effort to restore order in
Urumqi is, again, was seen by some western media as ‘crackdown’, and the riot
as but ‘peaceful protest.’

> 其实，为了维护民族团结，防止仇恨加剧，中国媒体的报道已经非常“不客观”了，那些血淋淋,惨不忍睹的镜头只有在海外媒体和互联网论坛上才可以见到，无耻的德国媒体竟然说中国政府用宣传propaganda来煽动汉人对维族人的仇恨。  
>
> 如果是警方武力镇压造成所谓的维族“和平抗议者”大量伤亡，图片呢？视频呢？截至此刻，有哪家外媒，有哪个境外疆独组织能提供哪怕一张（段）这种性质的图片和视频？

Actually, in order to maintain ethnic harmony and prevent hatred, the Chinese
media is already way too constraint. Those bloody and shocking images can only
be seen in oversees media and internet. But the shameful Germany media said
Chinese government used propaganda to fan Han's hatred against Uygurs.  
If it was police crackdown that made so large a casualty of ‘peaceful
protesters’, where are the pictures? Videos? So far, has any single picture be
provided by western media or separatist to prove the bloody crackdown?

On Youtube. in response to [a video
titled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBedY-rB5rM) 新疆万人抗议 呼吁国际关注 (Thousands
protesting in Xinjiang, call for international attention), ahuich said

> 放你妈的狗屁！有计划的镇压！  
>  维吾尔人屠杀了154人，重伤800人，是冲突，是示威。武警前 来维持秩序，就是有计划的镇压

Bullshit well-panned crackdown!  
That Uygurs killed 154 and hurt 800 is only conflict and protest. But armed
police to restore order is well-planned crackdown!

> 如果政府机关枪扫射了。拿我做梦都偷着笑。可怜的中国政府，什么 事都不做也照样被人扣屎盆子。既然这样，为什么不痛痛快快的干呢 ！！！

If the government fired machine guns, I would laugh in my dream. But the poor
government, even if it did nothing it will still be condemned. If so, why not
just do it?

On New York Times, a series of pictures showing the riot is also criticized as
catering to stereotypes and distorting facts.  
[This picture by Nir
Elias/Reuters](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/07/06/world/20090706-CHINA_5.html),
which shows a man lying on the bed with the caption ‘Uighurs injured at a
hospital in the city during a media tour by the authorities on Monday.’, is
ridiculed by Chin:

> 是啊，这照片明明是里面的名字明明是汉人，到了注解的时候变成维族了

The name tag shows the man is obviously a HAN Chinese. But in the caption, he
becomes a Uygurs.

walala said:

> 构图的idea就是: 先拍军警, 再拍维族, 拍伤者/血之类, 也放个维族在照片里. 总之  
>  要旨是暗示军警打维族.

The idea of making pictures is: first armed police, then Uygurs, then injured
people blooding, and a few Uygurs. Anyway, it is meant to imply that police
beat Uygurs.

Radio Free Asia is also [criticized for
mistakenly](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20090706_1.htm) citing a picutre of
Shishou incident for Xinjiang riot. What is interesting is that, Rebiya
Kadeer, the woman alleged by CCP to be the head of the riot, showed exactly
this picture in her interview to depict the situation in Urumqi. Relative
information can been at the bottom of[ this
page](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20090706_1.htm) in EastSouthWestNorth.

The journalists’ unscheduled confrontation with a large crowd of Uygurs women,
who were wailing for their missing families arrested by authority, was also
thought to be suspicious. The [protesting women were
featured](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/media-tour-goes-very-
very-badly-for-chinese-authorities/?scp=4&sq=Uighurs%20injured%20&st=cse) by
several influential western newspapers.

The[ journalist of Wenhui
Newspaper](http://www.peacehall.com/forum/200907/boxun2009a/75566.shtml) wrote
about what happened at the time:

>
> 在成功吸引众多记者的注意后，这些维族妇女又分成几群，对记者、特别是外国记者，声泪俱下地用维语哭喊。她们当中，每几个人裡便会有一名懂汉语的维族妇女负责用中文作现场翻译，这让记者们很容易地明白其哭诉的主要内容是：她们的丈夫、儿子或父亲，昨晚被警察抓走了、打死了。但当被问及到底有多少人昨晚被抓或死亡时，这些维族妇女却又不断变换「口径」：最初向外媒记者说有100人，之后又改口说300人，最后又称有上千人。
>
>
> 记者注意到，在一些中国记者用普通话向这些妇女提问时，她们会用中文回答说听不懂，但面对外国记者的镜头，她们马上用流利的汉语大声哭诉，并不断有人晕倒。如果发现外国记者没注意到这些「细节」，还会有人主动上前，拉外国记者们去拍。

After attracting the attention, the Uygurs women divided into a few groups,
wailling in Uygurs to reporters, particularly those foreigners. Among them,
there was one women in each group that translated their words into Chinese so
that jourmalists understand what they were talking about easily, that is,
their husbands, sons, or fathers were taken away or beaten to death last
night. But when being asked how many were dead or arrested, they changed the
number all the time: first it is 100, then 300, and finally over 1000.
