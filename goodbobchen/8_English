Vaughan Smith, founder of the [Frontline Club](http://www.frontlineclub.com/)
for journalists in London, is video-blogging from Afghanistan on [Frontline's
blog](http://www.fromthefrontline.co.uk/blogs/). On September 1, 2007 he
[reported](http://www.fromthefrontline.co.uk/blogs/index.php?blog=2&title=fighting_in_sangin_afghanistan&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1)
on a battle between British and Afghan soldiers against the Taliban.

Vaughan said:

> The Green Zone is the area on either side of the Helmand River, which runs

> difficult walk we arrived at the start point of the operation and began what

**Herat is not our Paris**

_Herat Blog_ [says](http://www.heratblog.com) [Fa] many in Afghanistan believe
that [Herat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat), the third largest city in
Afghanistan, is being reconstructed as government officials say. However,
locals are saying that nothing is happening compared to a few years ago. The
blogger quotes Naghib Arvin, a local journalist who argues:

> Many think that Herat is Afghanistan's Paris and they want to stop the
> reconstruction project. Such an idea is no more than a joke. We should not
> stop reconstruction in Herat.

According to this journalist, two reasons that reconstruction may have stopped
is lack of investment and support for local producers.

**Do not make fun of people's accents!**

_Mohmmad Kazem Kazemi_
[says](http://www.persianblog.ir/posts/?weblog=mkkazemi.persianblog.ir&postid=7235579)
[Fa] that he sent a letter to JameJam, the official magazine of Iranian TV, to
protest against the television series
[_Charkhaneh_](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/08/24/afghan-bloggers-
irritated-by-iranian-tv-series/). He criticized producers of _Charkhaneh_ ,
for making fun of Afghan people's accents and the way they speak
Persian/Farsi. He says Afghans are hurt and offended by it. The blogger adds
that in reality nobody in Afghanistan speaks as the characters do in the
series.
