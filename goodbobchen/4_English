[A list of casualty](http://news.163.com/08/0512/21/4BPAV1DG0001124J.html) in
every affected regions was being refreshed in portal websites.

**Updated: 9219（8.00 am, 05.13） deaths were reported in 8 provinces, while the
information** **in Wenchuan county** (汶川县) **,** **the epicenter,** **is still
unknown. It has been isolated as the communication and roads were cut off. The
place is where Han, Tibetans, Hui people lived together.**

A [7.8 magnitude
earthquake](http://news.163.com/08/0512/14/4BOIJQ910001124J.html) struck China
at 2:28 p.m. local time. The quake was centered at Wen-chuan county, Sichuan
province, some 50 miles west-northwest to Chengdu, where 12 million people
live. It was not only intense but massive as well, since across the country
has felt its impact. Up till now 107 deaths have been reported, along with
cases of injured and collapsed buildings.

The road to Wen-chuan has been paralyzed.

The casualty is feared to be still rising.

Updated: In the evening, 3000 to 5000 deaths were estimated in Beichuan
county, contiguous to the epicenter.

After about an hour of the tremor, related news was released on scores of
websites, including Xinhua Net, the official news agency.

Premier Wenjiabao has reached the disaster area to lead the rescue, saying
that the situation is “particularly severe”. 5000 soldiers have been sent for
rescue.

The range of the quake’s impact is huge. It could by no means be covered up as
shortly after the seism occurred, from southern cities as far as Hong Kong and
Haikou, to northern metropolises such as Beijing, or populated regions like
Chongqing and Shanghai, tremor, shaking, and dizziness caused by wobbling were
felt in varied degree.

Swarms of people went online to share their experiences during the quakes that
lasted for over 10 seconds. A roundup is coming.

A netizen from Beijing
[reported](http://comment.news.163.com/news_guonei7_bbs/4BOIJQ910001124J.html):

> 木樨地有震感！我还以为是自己头晕呢，原来是发地震了！

I could feel the timber floor vibrating! I first thought I was just giddy.
Then I realized it was an earthquake.

Another netizen in Tianjing
[commented](http://comment.news.163.com/news_guonei7_bbs/4BOIJQ910001124J.html)

> 我单位在16层，震感很明显，持续了约2分钟。

I worked on the 16th floor, and the tremor was evident. It continued for about
2 minutes.

Beijing and Tianjing were 960 miles to the northeast of the epicenter, a fact
from which people came to realize how severe the seism was. The picture below
showed exactly the evacuated people outside the building of Xinhua Net, the
official news agency in Beijing.

In [tianya](http://tianya.cn), a special thread was opened to collect the
information from all over the country about the astounding minutes.

Briel [told](http://cache.tianya.cn/publicforum/content/free/1/1222072.shtml)
what he felt in Luoyang, Henan, middle China.

> 我在十楼上。。。突然发现自己在晃。灯在乱抖，然后外面有玻璃哗啦掉的声音。。  
>  晃的好厉害啊！  
>  现在好了。

I was on the 10th floor, and suddenly felt myself in shaking. The lamp was
swaying and the crack of falling glass from outside was heard. So crazily
shaking!  
It’s better now.

There was no exception even in Ningbo, a coastal city on the east-south.

So terribly shaking!  
I was on the 18th floor, and could feel strongly the house swaying to and fro,
just like on a boat. I was so dizzy at the time. When running out to ask about
what happened, my colleagues told me to go downstairs. People gathered on the
staircases. And I saw all people in the office building were out there.

I am still feeling uncomfortable.

Feeling dizzy is what quite a lot of people initially felt when the quake
coming. Most of them were amazed at the situation, having no idea what was
happened. But soon the instinct forced them to act.

In a voting “do you feel the quake?” on Tianya.com, Chongqing, a city of over
30 million people, topped the list that most people felt the tremor there. The
city was contiguous to Sichuna province.

In [163.com](http://163.com), someone from Chongqing [told her hard
time](http://comment.news.163.com/news_guonei7_bbs/4BOIJQ910001124J.html):

> 当时正睡午觉,货架上的货物哗哗掉,只见房子剧烈晃动,老公拉上我就跑,车都没敢去开~~~~  
>  从来没想过,合川还会地震

I was taking a nap then, and heard the packages and sundries clamoring down,
and the house shaking intensely. My husband dragged me away on foot
immediately, without even trying to get in the car.  
I have never thought the city would meet an earthquake.

_In a Chongqing community, people in panic_  
yybz020123 told about Xi'an, a city in mid-China:

> 西安震感强烈，有十几秒，大地在抖，窗子，门，在响，现在院子里都是人，手机没型号

The city was rocking for over 10 seconds, the land trembling, so were the
windows, doors rattling. Now people are gathering in the yard. But the
cellphones are not able to work.

According to the updated news, 2300 telecommunication towers were disrupted by
the quake, which added to the hardship of rescue.

_Students getting rescued._

Shanghai was affected as well.

> 上海有震感，我们大楼晃了几分钟，头晕得厉害

The quake was felt here too. Our building wobbled for a few minutes, which
made me dizzy.

Deep-adventure was in Guangzhou

> 广州感觉到了 我还以为我患了帕金逊  
>  当时蹲在椅子上 全身不自觉左摇右摆 好可怕  
>  7.8级 祈求不要有人员伤亡  
>  今年有点烦

Guangzhou got it, too. I thought I had parkinsonism.  
I was then crouching on my seat, involuntarily shaking left and right. So
terrible!  
7.8! Pray no one get hurt. Such a year!
