Fayzinisso Vohidova, a prominent Tajik lawyer who was renowned for her
preparedness to defend political arrestees and constant criticism of
Tajikistan's authoritarian system, passed away on January 4.

On Facebook, where open criticism of authorities in the Central Asian country
is growing rarer and rarer, the outpouring of grief told its own story.

A mother of three, Vohidova was often referred to by her admirers as a
“Gurdofarid”, referencing the fearless ancient Persian heroine from the
[Shahnameh epic Persian poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh).

She lost a short battle to pneumonia only a week after celebrating her 55th
birthday.

In recent years, Vohidova suffered regular harassment at the hands of Tajik
authorities, verbal attacks from regime supporters and a curtailment of her
professional activities.

Although she avoided arrest, Vohidova had her license to practise law
suspended and[ could not leave the
country](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/16/tajikistan-travel-ban-rights-
lawyer) at the time of her death.

Steve Swerdlow of the Human Rights Watch group wrote a moving and widely-
shared thread on Twitter in honour of a woman he regarded as a friend and
colleague.

## ‘The mother of braveness’

Vohidova was born in a remote district in northern Tajikistan and studied law
at the prestigious Moscow State University.

A member of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Tajikistan, she earned a
name defending young people facing jail over extremism charges widely applied
by the secular authorities.

When a[ BBC reporter, Urinboy Usmonov, was
arrested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13793062) on similar
charges in 2011, it was only logical that Vohidova would take up the case.
Usmonov was convicted but freed from jail as the international media spotlight
burned down on the country.

Another BBC journalist, London-based Darius Raja bian [wrote on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dariush.rajabian/posts/10155732280762027)
that the online reaction to the rights defender's death was unprecedented:

> Ҳаргиз Файзбуки Тоҷикистон ин ҳама сӯгвор набуд ва ин ҳама файз намеборид,
> ки ҳоло меборад. Рафтанаш ҳам дарсе буд…

> Tajik Facebook has never been in mourning the way it is now. Even by leaving
> us she gave us a lesson.

Yet another reporter, Anora Sarkorova, [described Vohidova
as](https://www.facebook.com/anora.sarkor/posts/10156252308379200) “the honour
and conscience of the Tajik nation.”

“She was not silent when others buried their heads in the sand. She risked her
life every day and knew the value of this risk,” added Sarkorova.

Vohidova’s own Facebook wall, filled with birthday congratulations just two
weeks ago, is now overflowing with condolences.

Tajik social media users who have been silenced in recent years thanks to
state targeting of online critics, broke this silence to express deep sorrow
at Vohidova's passing and their own rightlessness.

In a country passionate about poetry, it is perhaps unsurprising that some
users expressed their distress in verse.

On December 9, in her [last ever Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1152274424931816&id=100004478071911),
Vohidova wrote about two women that she particularly admired — German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and the well-known Russian rights defender Lyudmila
Alexeyeva, who had died the day before.

While she wrote that she liked Merkel for her simplicity and, poignantly, the
German leader's recent decision to step away from power, Vohidova celebrated
Alexeyeva as “a defender of the fallen, the suffering, the poor.”

“In any case, there is only one path (to God)! And this path should be the
path of honour, of good will and actions, with human dignity, pure and modest.
Let us pray to God to ask that people would cry after each one of us with
tears of thankfulness!” Vohidova wrote.
