Odessa's police will investigate the city's mayor Gennady Trukhanov for
“impeding the lawful professional activity of journalists”, a punishable
offence by Ukraine's criminal code, following an incident in which his
security detail physically assaulted a local reporter.

On December 27, Radio Svoboda journalist Mikhail Shtekel posed a question to
Trukhanov at a press briefing, to which the mayor responded by pushing him
away while his security proceeded to expel the journalist out of the building.

Shtekel, whose employer Radio Svoboda is the Ukrainian version of Radio Free
Europe, recorded the whole incident on camera and posted the video on Twitter
soon afterward:

[Article 171](https://juristoff.com/resyrsi/kz/ugolovnyj-kodeks-
ukrainy/5958-statya-171-vosprepyatstvovanie-zakonnoj-professionalnoj-
deyatelnosti-zhurnalistov) of Ukraine's criminal code typifies the crime of
“impeding lawful professional activity of journalists,” which covers illegal
seizure of reporting materials, denial to provide access to information, among
other actions. It imposes fines and a maximum prison time of three years.

On December 29, Shtekel [stated, on his Facebook profile
page,](https://www.facebook.com/mishajedi/posts/2285690684777357?__tn__=-R)
that with the help of his lawyers he had filed a criminal complaint related to
Article 171 against Trukhanov, his guards, and the police officers who
participated in the aggression. On January 2, the police of Odessa confirmed
for Detector Media that they had initiated a criminal
[investigation](https://detector.media/community/article/143776/2019-01-02-politsiya-
vidkrila-provadzhennya-cherez-intsident-za-uchastyu-zhurnalista-radio-svoboda-
ta-mera-odesi/) of the incident.

### The mayor's contempt for journalists

This is only the most recent episode in which Trukhanov or his subordinates
have attacked journalists. In July 2018, when reporter Bogdan Osinskyi asked
him why he had referred to a group of environmentalists as “green worms,” the
mayor grabbed the journalist's phone and[ tried to hit
him](https://znaj.ua/ru/mer-nabrosylsya-s-kulakamy-na-zhurnalysta-yz-za-
zelenyh-glystov?page=39) with it.

In April 2018, British journalist Andy Verity, who had come to Odessa with the
BBC to report on a corruption probe that involves the mayor, was
[pushed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLR3J1FUuA), knocked down, and
kicked in the groin by Trukhanov's security guards after he approached him
with a question. The [BBC has captured ](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-
europe-43867430/bbc-reporter-andy-verity-was-kicked-in-the-groin-in-
ukraine)the whole incident on camera.

Finally, just before the end of 2018, Trukhanov said that Member of Parliament
Mustafa Nayem, a former journalist, [asks “stupid
questions](https://www.facebook.com/sternenko/videos/2312618205681182/).”

Separately, Trukhanov is a defendant at an emblezzlement
[case](https://delo.ua/econonomyandpoliticsinukraine/delo-protiv-truhanova-po-
zavodu-krajan-peredali-v-sud-346876/) related to the sale of Odessa's city
hall building known as the Krayan plant. A trial began in October — the press
briefing where Shtekel was attacked on December 27 followed a court hearing of
this trial.

The mayor has also received harsh criticism, including in international fora,
for the behavior of his “municipal guards”. Those are private security
officers hired by the city of Odessa under suspicious circumstances who have
been [accused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--93rovrLP4) of multiple [human
rights violations](https://globalvoices.org/2018/10/24/ukraine-is-outsourcing-
law-enforcement-to-private-companies-whose-record-on-respecting-human-rights-
isnt-great), including [against
journalists.](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/07/25/attack-by-municipal-
guards-signals-rising-threats-against-journalists-in-ukraine/)

Trukhanov is expected to run for re-election in 2020. However, if any of the
criminal cases he's facing ends in conviction, he might find himself fighting
for his own freedom rather than for his seat as mayor of Odessa.

On November 30, Trukhanov [presented](http://timer-
odessa.net/news/mer_odessi_otchitalsya_pered_gorodom_za_rabotu_v_2018_m_630.html)
his own work in a positive light at an annual ceremony at Odessa's city hall.
Such enthusiasm probably isn't shared by the city's journalists, for whom
press freedom feels ever more elusive.
