A banner calling for a march to Aso Villa, the workplace and official
residence of the Nigerian President, located in the capital city of Abuja, to
protest the continuous killings in Nigeria, June 2018.

On [June 23, 2018, ](https://qz.com/1315817/plateau-attacks-more-
than-200-killed-in-herdsmen-farmers-clash/)armed gunmen attacked 11 villages
and killed more than 200 people near Jos, the capital city of central
Nigeria's Plateau State, without any intervention from security forces, in one
of the bloodiest retaliatory pastoral conflicts yet.

Following the June 23 attacks, Nigerians are saying enough is enough and have
taken to social media to protest a nation-wide uptick in brutal killings using
hashtags such as #MakeNigeriaSafeAgain and #StoptheKillings. Others have taken
to the street, though in trickles.

As Africa's most populous nation, [with 87 million of its residents living in
poverty,](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/26/africa/nigeria-overtakes-india-
extreme-poverty-intl/index.html) the [Boko
Haram](https://globalvoices.org/2018/02/14/several-months-after-their-
abduction-by-boko-haram-thirteen-nigerian-citizens-regain-freedom/)
insurgency, communal clashes, banditry and other forms of conflict are also to
blame for the [soaring number of violent deaths in the
country](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/violent-
deaths-1351-killed-10-weeks/). Since January 2018 at least [1,813 people have
been
murdered](http://saharareporters.com/2018/06/28/revealed-2018-alone-1814-nigerians-
have-been-killed-—-more-double-entire-2017-figure) across 17 states — double
the 894 people killed in 2017 in Nigeria.

Gimba Kakanda, a writer and media influencer, took to the street along with
fellow Nigerians to air his displeasure and had this to say:

Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, former Minister of Education and [vice president of the
World Bank](http://blogs.worldbank.org/team/obiageli-ezekwesili) also took to
the street:

Through his Twitter account Africa Fact Zone, award-winning publicist and

Civil society groups also joined in:

Even former vice president Atiku Abubakar was stern in his condemnation of the
government's inability to protect its citizens:

> Mindless killings in our country, we cannot be in continuous mode of
> bloodletting & mourning. Government needs to be alive to its primary
> responsibility of protection of lives and property. My heart goes to the
> victims of Barkin Ladi LGA of Plateau State <https://t.co/x3f0UcHC2F>

In a [press
statement,](https://www.facebook.com/ainigeria/posts/1325617434249415) Amnesty
International Nigeria joined the online commotion:

> The authorities have a responsibility to protect lives and properties, but
> they are clearly not doing enough going by what is happening. The latest
> incidence in Plateau state, where armed gunmen attacked 11 villages on 23
> June for at least seven hours and killed at least 200 villagers without
> intervention from security forces should be investigated.

On Twitter, the NGO has also shared a map of the killings:

> Nigeria: Mapping the killings across Nigeria from January to June 27:

Following massive condemnation over the June 23 attack, President Muhammadu
Buhari paid a condolence visit to Jos. In his speech to distressed citizens,
Buhari praised his government over the handling of insecurities in the
country, but urged citizens to [pray for divine
intervention:](http://sunnewsonline.com/insecurity-fellow-nigerians-let-us-
pray-buhari/)

> Nobody can say that we haven’t done well in terms of security, we have done
> our best, but the way this situation is now, we can only
> [pray](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/274045-what-buhari-gov-
> lalong-told-plateau-citizens-over-killings.html).

The president's remarks only added fuel to the fire, as the country's citizens
are not having any of that.

> Pres Buhari [@MBuhari](https://twitter.com/MBuhari?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) went
> to Jos to tell the people who had just buried hundreds of their loved ones
> that were massacred that there is nothing he can do they should pray to God,
> yet he has lots of security protecting him. Why didn't he send his security
> to Jos & pray to God?

With rising frustration in the country, the demand for good governance and
protection of lives and properties continues to rise among Nigerians. Only
time will tell if things will improve.
