What is the human side of the Brexit, the UK ‘divorce’ from the EU? Numerous
controversies remain, as well as the need to fix the system in order to avoid
further suffering for millions of people caught in a bureaucratic uncertainty
or facing arbitrary and unjust rules and regulations.

According to the newspaper [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2822423/eu-
citizens-uk-after-brexit-visas-numbers-britain/), around 3.6 million EU
nationals currently live in the UK, including nearly 600,000 children. Among
them, eastern Europeans have been specially branded by Leavers (those who
support UK's separation from Europe) as “unwanted” immigrants. They often are
[tagged](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/11/i-dont-speak-my-
native-language-in-public-eastern-europeans-on-post-referendum-life) as
“benefit scroungers, here to steal jobs”. This sentiment is not new, as they
already felt like second-class citizens because of working restrictions
initially put on migrants from central and eastern Europe when they joined the
EU. Arguably, [UK's decision to open its labor
market](https://theconversation.com/the-huge-political-cost-of-blairs-
decision-to-allow-eastern-european-migrants-unfettered-access-to-
britain-66077) to these countries is what led the voters to become so opposed
to migration from the EU.

Photographer [Deividas Buivydas](http://www.davidphos.com/) shared some
[captivating images](http://www.calvertjournal.com/features/show/8470/brexit-
britain-eastern-europe-eu-photography-race) from Boston, Lincolnshire, where
tension against eastern Europeans is evident and post-Brexit anxiety is
bubbling. This town registered the highest Leave vote in Britain, at 75.6 per
cent and was dubbed “the capital of Brexit”. It also is home of the largest
proportion of Eastern Europeans in the country.

The life story of [Alexandra
Bulat](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ssees/people/politics-and-sociology-research-
students-folder/alexandra-bulat), a young scholar from Romania who made a
career at top UK academic institutions also offers a telling example, as she
referred to a [famous phrase by UK Prime Minister Theresa
May](http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/exclusive-brightest-and-best-
migrants-will-still-come-to-east-anglia-says-prime-minister-theresa-
may-1-4858570), uttered in January 2017:

Ms. Bulat shared her story in [a series of much-retweeted
tweets](https://twitter.com/alexandrabulat/status/971001795630764033) which
are summarized bellow.

On 1 June 2016, few weeks ahead of the [Brexit
Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016),
the “Vote Leave” campaign issued [a statement by Michael Gove, Boris Johnson,
Priti Patel, and Gisela
Stuart](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606220453/http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/restoring_public_trust_in_immigration_policy_a_points_based_non_discriminatory_immigration_system),
claiming that:

> Second, there will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully resident in
> the UK. These EU citizens will automatically be granted indefinite leave to
> remain in the UK and will be treated no less favourably than they are at
> present.

In October of the same year, David Davis, Brexit Secretary [tried to
downplay](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-10-10/debates/6CE5F6BB-3AA4-4332-BF7A-577DB35BDB77/NextStepsInLeavingTheEuropeanUnion#contribution-6FF59BED-475A-46B6-A5BD-9F064194A17E)
the concerns of people like Ms. Bulat's mother, by claiming that “Five out of
six migrants who are here either already have indefinite leave to remain or
​will have it by the time we depart the [EU].” However, the UK fact-checking
service FullFact [concluded](https://fullfact.org/europe/brexit-which-eu-
citizens-will-have-right-stay-uk/):

> This is not fully substantiated by the evidence and will depend on the
> arrangements we make upon leaving the EU. Whatever happens, EU citizens are
> not going to be forced to leave en masse.

FullFact also noted other points of uncertainty, which depend on the outcome
of the [UK-EU negotiations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit_negotiations)
which are still in the works, and are supposed to end by March 2019. For
instance, the right to permanent residence under EU law may or may not survive
Brexit and might depend on meeting criteria for permanent residence such as
“whether they’re working, looking for work, self-employed, studying or self-
sufficient…”

Instead, automatic grant of all existing rights promised by Vote Leave is
still uncertainty for both EU migrants in UK and British in EU27. Many areas
remain unclear and are under negotiations such as some family reunification
rights and political rights (EU migrants can vote in local elections only)…

A [recent protest by the group Highly Skilled
Migrants](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/30/skilled-migrants-
protest-against-uk-visa-policies), which says it represents over 600 doctors,
engineers, IT professionals, teachers and their families in Britain attempted
to raise profile of ‘discriminatory’ Home Office rules. The [‘harsh migration
policy’](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/16/business-leader-
warns-may-against-harsh-immigration-policy) affects both immigrants from
‘overseas’, and those coming from the EU member countries. Latest data
indicates large drop in the number of EU nationals seeking jobs in the UK due
to [Brexit uncertainty](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/net-
migration-of-eu-nationals-to-britain-falls-by-75000).

Ms. Bulat concluded her story with the following tweet:

> We need a solution to protect all
> [#CitizensRights](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CitizensRights?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw),
> just as promised by Vote Leave. No more “bad migrant”-“good migrant”
> division games. People's lives do not fit in a tickbox. Politicians should
> listen to more real migrant stories to understand.
