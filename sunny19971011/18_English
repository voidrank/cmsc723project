Since 2015, at[ least 42 Ugandan
women](https://twitter.com/ntvuganda/status/1012765173424193536) have been
kidnapped, maimed and murdered in and around Uganda's capital Kampala, half of
them in a space of only three months in 2017. Some of their bodies were found
with brutal signs of sexual violence.

The string of murders, all bearing gruesome similar details, has horrified the
country. The motivation behind them remains unclear, but [witchcraft is a
popular theory](https://globalvoices.org/2017/09/14/ugandan-police-
investigate-a-serial-murder-spree-targeting-women/). Authorities are yet to
charge a single suspect.

Tired of living in fear, the women of Uganda felt they had to do something.

On June 30, 2018, the Women’s Protest Working Group (WPWG), with the support
of feminists from other countries, staged a peaceful demonstration in the
capital city of Kampala to protest against the rampant kidnapping and murders
targeting women in Uganda.

> And so I March. To remember them, they were not given any justice and no one

At the march, which Global Voices attended, WPWG leader Dr. Stella Nyanzi told
the crowd that the women are pursuing key interventions such as justice for
the families of those murdered and also to push for action on violence against
women. Fellow activist Patricia Twasiima then read out the names of the 42
murdered women.

Earlier, the police had attempted to block the protests claiming that the
issues the women were protesting had already been resolved after President
Museveni addressed the nation on his [10-point
plan](http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Did-Museveni-security-
master-plan-answer-questions-day-/689844-4627442-7tytyn/index.html) for
restoring security in Uganda.

protest-over-kidnaps-murders/688334-4634738-14jemldz/index.html) from the
Commissioner of Police stated:

> This serves to inform you that the intended demonstration to raise
> awareness, express displeasure about the spate of killings and kidnap of
> women/girls cannot be allowed to go on as scheduled.

The women were determined to go on with the protest anyway:

> We will no longer settle for speeches, thought and prayers, from the police
> force and government funded with taxpayers’ money. Its time for action so
> join us tomorrow at Centenary Park as we demand for answers to the
> unanswered questions

The attempted ban triggered even more support from Ugandans including
journalists who vowed to join, with men and women alike.

opinion piece in the Daily Monitor that made rounds on Twitter on why he would
be joining the protest:

TV journalist Mujuni Raymond said that he would also join the protest:

Eventually, police gave in to the pressure. The women’s march observed strict
guidelines set by the police.

This is the first peaceful protest led by activists since the passing of the
controversial [Public Order Management Act
2013,](https://ulii.org/ug/legislation/act/2013/1/PUBLIC%20ORDER%20MANAGEMENT%20ACT.pdf)
which grants the Police's Inspector General wide discretion to permit or
forbid public gatherings. Past protests since the Act was published have
turned violent.

> The women of Uganda have proved that protests don't have to be violent.

The March wields more pressure on authorities not only to provide a safer
society for women but also to uphold Uganda’s constitution and respect
citizens’ right to freedom of assembly.
