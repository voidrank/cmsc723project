On Friday afternoon, March 16, 2018, many people in the Netherlands found
themselves watching a campaign commercial for the Party for Freedom (PVV). Red
block letters flashed against the screen to the sound of a booming musical
score. “Islam is discrimination,” the first sentence read. To the sound of
ominous drumbeats, “discrimination” is then replaced with words like
“violence,” “terror,” “Jewish hate,” and “Christian hate.”

The Netherlands hosts local elections on March 21. The video from the PVV was
aired on public broadcaster NPO in a time slotted for political messages.
Almost immediately, complaints to the public station began to pour in. Many
were shocked that such a video could be aired at all. Others complained that
it was aired in the afternoon.

In response to complaints, [the NPO ombudsman
stated](https://nos.nl/artikel/2222742-kritiek-op-pvv-spot-rutte-noemt-

has no influence on political messages:

For his part, Prime Minister Rutte stated:

### A criminal complaint on the horizon?

Controversy is nothing new for Geert Wilders and the party he leads.

Wilders has been brought up on criminal charges of discriminatory speech twice
already. The first time was for a series of incidents that included articles,
videos, and public speaking and was alleged to spread hatred of Moroccans,
Muslims, and other non-Western minorities. The second criminal charge was the
result of public event where he led his campaign supporters in anti-Moroccan
chants.

In the above video, Wilders tells his supporters that there are three
questions that define the PVV. The first question he asks is, “Do you want
more or less of the European Union?” His supporters chant, _Minder, minder,
minder_ (Less, less, less).

The next question is whether his supporters want more or less of the labor
party. Prior to asking the third question, Wilders states that he knows that
he will be criminally charged because of what he is about to say, but he
values “freedom of expression” too much not to say it. He then goes on to ask,
“Do you want more or fewer Moroccans in this city and this country?” In a 2016
trial, he was, indeed, found guilty of incitement and encouraging
discrimination.

Will history repeat itself for Wilders this time round? The party Islam
Democrats [shared on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/islam.democraten/posts/1576999922413214)
their intention to file a complaint against him for the recent TV spot:

> “Wij roepen een ieder in dit land, moslim en niet-moslim, op om stelling te
> nemen tegen moslimhaat, xenofobie en andere vormen van onverdraagzaamheid.”

> We call on everyone in this country, Muslim and not-Muslim, to take a stand
> against Muslim hate, xenophobia, and other forms of intolerance.

### ‘A clear double standard’ on identity

While the extreme message of the PVV video is easy to condemn, everyday racism
is no novelty in the Netherlands. In 2011, Prime Minister Rutte said:

> We gaan er gewoon voor zorgen, dames en heren, dat we dat prachtige land
> weer teruggeven aan de Nederlanders, want dat is ons project!

> Ladies and gentleman, we are going to ensure that we return this beautiful
> land to the Dutch, because that is our project!

What many understood from his words was that being “Dutch” excludes immigrants
or even second, third, or fourth-generation descendants of non-white
immigrants.

Dr. Halleh Ghorashi has written about the resistance to talk about racism by
Dutch society in “[Racism and ‘the Ungrateful Other’ in the
Netherlands”](http://hallehghorashi.com/nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/chapter-
in-book-Dutch-racism.pdf):

> Every reaction that acknowledges the insecure feelings of the “native Dutch”
> justifies the critique of migrant culture as well. Here we can observe a
> clear double standard: It is OK for the “native Dutch” to feel defensive and
> to protect their culture, but migrants are criticized for defending theirs.
> Migrants are seen as the ones who need to adopt or even assimilate into the
> new culture. Not many people would consider this asymmetric approach racist,
> since it is believed that the discussion is about culture and not about race
> (see also Schinkel on this). This begs the question of why the discussion of
> the culture of migrants focuses on how it needs to change, yet discussion of
> the culture of the “native Dutch” recognizes the reasons for a defensive
> attitude.

In her book “[White Innocence](https://www.dukeupress.edu/white-innocence),”
Dr. Gloria Wekker talks about the way racism permeates Dutch society, yet
remains unspoken and unacknowledged. She states that Dutch society sees itself
as progressive and tolerant, and this blinds many to the racism inherent in
the system:

> In that story we are a very progressive country. We are the champions of
> women’s liberation, liberation of gays and lesbians. We also like to tell
> ourselves that we are color blind and anti-racist. The thing is, if you ask
> people from the colonies or from Morroco or Turkey, this does not conform to
> their experiences.

In this short talk, she discusses the ways in which racism manifests itself
the Netherlands.

### Where is the discussion about racism in the Netherlands heading?

On Sunday, March 18, an estimated 13,000 people in Amsterdam braved the cold
to demonstrate against racism. What is clear is that more and more people
affected by racist policies are creating platforms for discussion and debate,
as well as engaging with the political process.
