Secondary school [entrance
examinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_Entrance_Assessment) in
[the Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Examinations_Council)
have been around for over a century, a colonial holdover [from as early as
1879](http://uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/13706/Secondary%20School%20Entrance%20Examinations%20in%20the%20Caribbean%20De%20Lisle.pdf?sequence=1)
in some territories. Though renamed and restructured several times, they have
remained as what many experts
[deem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Entrance_Examination#Criticism) an
[irrelevant](https://globalvoices.org/2017/07/08/trinidad-tobagos-secondary-
school-entrance-exam-elitist-divisive-irrelevant/), stress-inducing test that
sucks the joy out of learning for eleven-year-olds region-wide.

Now, at least one regional government is poised to actually do something about
it. According to [Barbados Today](https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/06/03/death-
knell-sounded-for-common-
entrance/?fbclid=IwAR1RNkk2miAzK_5B3dri6zLfzZhb8N-ZC6cJn_1agmeIAoKz0r-LEvImCHg),
“sweeping changes are on the horizon” for the country's education system —
including getting rid of the controversial Common Entrance exam — in an effort
to create more diverse and
[equitable](http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/nl/node/309686) educational
opportunities for schoolchildren.

At a public meeting in the capital city of Bridgetown on June 2, 2019, Prime
Minister Mia Mottley linked the prevalence of violent crime to an education
system that does not value everyone's talents and said that it was time to
reject such an approach.

Under the current secondary entrance exam structure, only the top performing
students — essentially, those who test well — win access to the best schools.
Class also becomes a factor, since parents with good social connections often
pull strings to get their children into schools of their choice. Prime
Minister Mottley's position is that Barbados must “create an educational
system that makes every school a top school”.

The statistics back her up.
[Results](https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/06/18/common-entrance-result-reform-
needed/?fbclid=IwAR0cU5R0WKtUN2LnKNqmzGpU5pcpjrfIKAS3ZED1hewUydQNClm556lJ49s)
from the [2019 Barbados Secondary School Entrance
Examination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y79XYNfSMUk) (BSSEE) point to a
need for reform that includes a move away from a curriculum that is heavily
slanted towards academics to include more of the arts as well as technical and
vocational training.

There have also been calls for more inclusivity when it comes to [special
needs children](https://newsday.co.tt/2019/04/04/more-support-coming-for-
special-needs-students/?fbclid=IwAR353BCBdeNWONQ3-gE4cUTJULD21Nny8I9gQcRs-
MmLlFf9ReYXN_D0Cds), who are often [not adequately
supported](https://newsday.co.tt/2019/04/03/ministry-blanks-119-students-
special-needs-for-
sea/?fbclid=IwAR11BNM6xoXG1qwJGULxD79H0O6Qw3fBimMCLgJjPBmeW7ZIep0dTbFCH7k) by
the public school system.

In fact, it is often [private
schools](https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/private-schools-top-common-entrance-
exam/) that perform best on the exam, which again raises the issue of means
and class. Barbadian educator Rhonda Blackman
[noted](http://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/43360/abolish-exam) that
“many parents are of the opinion that the Common Entrance [exam] is the only
fair system for the ‘poor man’ child to get into a ‘good school'”, a
perception that she challenges, saying, “It is not the school but what
children do when they reach the respective schools that matters.” Blackman
recommends continuous assessment as opposed to a one-shot exam, zoning, which
she says will eradicate the “pecking order” of schools, and a “broad and
balanced” curriculum that takes the diversity of students’ skills into
account.

If the Mottley administration succeeds in this endeavour, it would be history-
making; other governments in other [CARICOM](https://www.caricom.org/) nations
have [promised](http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/04/education-trinidad-and-tobago-
putting-an-end-to-common-entrance-stress/) to abolish the exam before and
failed. In fact, the inability (on unwillingness) to abolish the exam —
despite its ill effects on children's mental health and self esteem — has
spawned spin-off industries in the form of [text book
publishing](http://www.news.gov.tt/content/education-minister-meets-book-
industry-organisation#.XRedD5NKgWo) and [extra
lessons](https://www.facebook.com/atuitionservices/posts/3320287704663957?__tn__=-R).
These, in turn, create a domino effect, with children's health being
compromised by having to tote [heavy
backpacks](https://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/local/child-labour-the-
average-schoolbag-is-
pounds/article_bbbaad1c-91d4-11e9-84e5-677737f2fce4.html?fbclid=IwAR1lV8BHCpcrRu9uyYYs4zIhG5V0ECiUVk9lBUgVurhqUapE8tVwfl755BE)
to and from school as well as by having less time to play, which has [widely
been established](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/1/182) as
integral to healthy childhood development.

Until the exam is abolished, however, children will continue to suffer in a
myriad of ways — including [being
abused](https://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/local/sea-abuse-parents-told-to-
back-
off/article_c11127cc-554e-11e9-991b-fb4d80a1a498.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-
share&fbclid=IwAR1nNtEoSY0ex4vxJ_cOP4XyWrKpFwKku-rKV0qnEWstNar25Q-d3eM0Or8) by
their parents in an effort to have them pass for a preferred school. The
vicious cycle prompted Jamaica-based writer Nazma Muller to [lay the
blame](https://www.facebook.com/nazma.muller/posts/10156744842325546) not at
the feet of desperate parents, but at the regional governments full of “old
dogs refusing to learn new tricks”:
