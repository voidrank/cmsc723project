In May, Japanese director Hirokazu Kore'eda became the first Japanese director
to win a [Palme d'Or](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/cannes-film-
festival-2018-award-winners-palme-d-or-1202816743/) at the Cannes Film
Festival in 21 years. This was the [sixth
time](https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/hirokaz-kore-eda-cannes-favorite-
japanese-1202816938/) Kore'eda had been nominated for an award at Cannes; the
Japanese director had won the Cannes [Jury
Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Kore-eda#Accolades) in 2013 for
his movie [‘Like Father, Like
Son’](https://variety.com/2013/film/global/cannes-film-review-like-father-
like-son-1200483388/).

The [Cannes Festival](https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/) is an annual film
festival held in Cannes, France, on the French Riveria. Widely considered to
be the most prestigious film festival in the world, [Cannes features just a
small, exclusive list of
films](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/16/15508284/cannes-film-
festival-2018-when-pronounce-high-heels-netflix-jury) each year for
competition. The festival has launched the careers of many influential
filmmakers, with [past
winners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival#Awards) of the
Palme d'Or [including](http://www.dw.com/en/10-memorable-winners-of-the-palme-
dor/a-38991434) ‘The Piano’ by Jane Campion, ‘Pulp Fiction’ by Quentin
Tarantino and ‘The Third Man’ by Carol Reed.

The last Japanese director to win the Palme d'Or was the [Japanese New
Wave](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/94-japanese-new-wave)‘s
[Shohei Imamura](http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007novedec/imamura.html),
for his film [The Eel](https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/the-
eel-1117341389/).

This year, Kore'eda won the Palme d'Or for his film
[‘Shoplifters](https://youtu.be/yl0Xf41hfJk)’. The movie, [which Kore'eda says
is based on real
events](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/02/national/media-
national/can-kore-edas-success-shed-light-poverty-japan/#.WxS3H0gvxhE), stars
frequent Kore'eda collaborators [Lily
Franky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Franky "Lily Franky") and [Kirin
Kiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirin_Kiki) and tells the story of a
family of shoplifters living on the poverty line, struggling to get by in
Tokyo.

Kore'eda's films typically explore family relationships, while documenting
human experiences. Although Kore'da is often compared with mid-century
Japanese director [Yasujiro
Ozu](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2x824a/hirokazu_koreeda_and_the_burden_of_ozu/),
Kore'eda himself has said as a director [he feels he has more in common with
Ken Loach](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/hirokazu-kore-
director-our-little-sister-interview), the British [social
realist](https://www.ft.com/content/c97ab83c-aa89-11e6-ba7d-76378e4fef24) film
director whose naturalism attempts to “[capture the truth of the
moment](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/11/ken-loach-capture-truth-
moment-jimmys-hall-readers-questions).”

Some [suggest](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/02/national/media-
national/can-kore-edas-success-shed-light-poverty-japan/#.WxsTkUgvxhE)
‘Shoplifters’ is intended to be a commentary on an economically struggling
Japan that has seen [economic disparity
increase](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-japan-inequality/) over the
past two decades, as [wages have
stagnated](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Low-wage-growth-stifles-Japan-s-
long-fight-against-deflation).

‘Shoplifters’ has indeed [provoked a
reaction](http://www.fccj.or.jp/component/k2/item/1089-shoplifters.html) in
Japan. For example, [notorious Japanese right-wing commentator and rhinoplasty
tycoon](https://globalvoices.org/2017/08/24/a-popular-japanese-cosmetic-
surgeon-is-called-out-for-admiring-nazism/) Takasu Katsuya has criticized
Kore'eda's film, saying:

> 日本人の「万引き家族」を日本人が賞賛することこそ世界の恥ではないかな？  
>  沈黙するのが国家の品格だよ。 <https://t.co/CBZ3Ty24uF>
>
> — 高須克弥 (@katsuyatakasu) [June 1,
> 2018](https://twitter.com/katsuyatakasu/status/1002361829006249984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

> Isn't it a global embarrassment that a Japanese person has won an award for
> making a film about a family of Japanese shoplifters? Just one more example
> of a nation on the decline.

In response to the sniping by Takasu and others, in a recent
[interview](http://www.fccj.or.jp/component/k2/item/1089-shoplifters.html)
with the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan Kore'eda said:

> A film is not a vehicle to accuse, or to relay a specific message. If we
> reduce a film to this, we lose all hope for cinema to ignite a richer
> conversation. I have never made a film to praise or to criticize something.
> That kind of filmmaking is nothing but propaganda.

After winning the Palme d'Or in May, Kore'eda also turned down an invitation
to meet and be recognized by Japan's culture ministry,
[explaining](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180608/p2a/00m/0et/019000c):

> Reflecting on the past where the film industry became united with ‘national
> interest’ and ‘national policy,’ I tend to think that keeping a clear
> distance from government authority is the right thing to do.

## A short selection of Hirokazu Kore'eda's films

Since 1991, Hirokazu Kore'eda has made 18 films and television documentaries.
Nearly all of them use a realistic style to explore the human experience,
often in the context of family.

### Maborosi (幻の光, 1995)

Based on the book by novelist [Teru Miyamoto](https://apjjf.org/-Miyamoto-
Teru/4402),
[‘Maborosi’](https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2009/09/the-humanists-
hirokazu-koreedas-maborosi-1995.html) (‘mirage’ or ‘phantom lights’) tells the
story of a young mother, widowed following the unexplained suicide of her
husband, who remarries and moves to the remote [Noto
Peninsula](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4252.html). [According to a New York
Times review](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/26/movies/film-festival-review-
suicide-mourning-and-a-different-sense-of-reality.html):

> Watching the film, which has little dialogue and many lingering shots of the
> Japanese landscape, one has an uncanny sense of entering the consciousness
> of the main character and seeing through her eyes, all without really
> knowing her.

The indoor ‘[tatami shots](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2257-the-
ozu-shot-tokyo-ga-and-late-spring)‘ Kore'eda employs as a director in this
film, combined with his focus on character and family life have led to
comparisons with director [Yasujiro
Ozu](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/5-essential-films-by-yasujiro-
ozu-263749/).

### After Life (ワンダフルライフ, 1998)

[In this 1998 film](https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/after-
life-2-1200455115/), the recently deceased get into heaven by selecting their
happiest memory — remembering this happy moment will be how they spend
eternity. Those who cannot decide on a memory are instead employed as
bureaucrats, counseling the newly dead while they remember the past. While
writing the script for ‘After Life’, Kore'eda Hirokazu actually interviewed
500 people, asking them to choose one memory they would want to remember for
the rest of time.

Writing in 1999, Roger Ebert [said](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/after-
life-1999):

> Kore-eda, with this film and the 1997 masterpiece
> ‘[Maborosi](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/maborosi-1997),’ has earned
> the right to be considered with Kurosawa, Bergman and other great humanists
> of the cinema. His films embrace the mystery of life, and encourage us to
> think about why we are here, and what makes us truly happy.

### Nobody Knows (誰も知らない, 2004)

[Based on true events](http://sensesofcinema.com/2017/cteq/nobody-knows/),
‘Nobody Knows’ tells the story of four children abandoned by their mother —
with a father nowhere to be seen — in a Tokyo apartment. With parents and
adults absent,the children recreate their own family as they struggle to
survive, with the film demonstrating [how social bonds have been severed in
contemporary Japan](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/04/movies/abandoned-
children-stow-away-at-home.html).

### Still Walking (歩いても 歩いても, 2008)

With its low, interior shots and scenes of family life, the 2008 ‘[Still
Walking](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/14/still-walking-review)‘
has also led to comparisons with Ozu. Set over the course of a weekend as a
family gathers to commemorate a death, ‘Still Walking’ examines how families
communicate — or choose not to.

Says reviewer [Peter
Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/14/still-walking-review):

> Unlike family dramas as conceived of in British or American drama, there are
> no crockery-smashing rows. ­Resentments and anger are contained within the
> conventions of politeness and respect. But this, I think, reflects the truth
> about the quiet, undramatic real lives of all families anywhere […]
