Sri Lanka has been embroiled in a [political
crisis](https://globalvoices.org/2018/11/02/the-peoples-voices-prevail-sri-
lankas-prime-ministerial-crisis-put-to-a-parliamentary-vote-on-november-5/)
since October 26 when president [Maithripala
Sirisena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maithripala_Sirisena) removed Prime
Minister [Ranil Wickremesinghe
–](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe) replacing him with
former president [Mahinda
Rajapaksa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa). This has led to a
[power struggle](https://globalvoices.org/2018/10/31/one-dead-in-sri-lanka-
amidst-a-constitutional-crisis/) between the newly appointed PM and the
recently ousted PM who both believe in the legitimacy of their position.
Thousands of protesters [have taken to the
streets](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1057465931306319873) of the capital
Colombo to question the constitutional legitimacy of the president's decision
and demand the parliament be reconvened to settle the matter. Bowing to
pressure, President Sirisena has promised to [reconvene the
parliament](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/sri-lanka-president-
agrees-to-summon-parliament-on-nov-7-10891078) on November 7.

On November 4, 2018, a group of people gathered at the Liberty roundabout in
the Kollupitiya neighborhood of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.

For some, it was their fifth day of standing in protest. Following news that
President Maithripala Sirisena and the United People’s Freedom Alliance had
stepped down from the coalition Government, a group of citizens decided to
meet at the roundabout every day, from 4:30 to 6:30 pm, until Parliament was
convened. On the first day, the protest coincided with a larger rally
organised by Ranil Wickremesinghe-led United National Party (UNP) held nearby
– but many of those who attended the rally on that day were quick to say that
they were not attending to support the UNP.

On October 30, a tweet by Lisa Fuller featuring one of the posters held by a
protester went viral. It read, “I’m not here for Ranil – I’m here for
democracy”.

The poster appeared to encapsulate the sentiments of many of those gathered at
the Liberty roundabout on October 30 and every day after.

Over the past few days, Groundviews documented those who attended the citizen
protest. Those attending included young people who had never attended a
protest before, senior citizens, activists and members of civil society. On
November 4, there were participants from Jaffna, Mannar, Batticaloa and Kandy
as well as from Colombo. For some, it was their first time at a protest.
Others had seen corruption continue on for decades (the oldest participant was
92 years old). Members from the corporate sector stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with activists from Jaffna and Batticaloa, who were flanked by those in the
theatre community.

Corruption was a recurring topic, given [revelations from UNP MP Ruwan
Wijewardene](https://groundviews.org/2018/11/05/infographic-the-cost-of-an-mp-
who-pays-the-price/) about sums of money being offered for Parliamentarians to
switch allegiances.

On October 30 and afterward, we asked those who attended one simple question –
“What made you decide to participate?”

Over the past few days, Groundviews documented those who attended the citizen
protest.

This is what they had to say:

As evening fell, the electricity at the Liberty roundabout remained switched
off. Later on, Mayor of Colombo Rosy Senanayake tweeted that this was “an act
of sabotage”.

Undeterred, the protesters used the light of their mobile phones and continued
chanting.

Eventually, at 7 pm, the protest came to an end – to be resumed the next day,
and the day after that, until Parliament reconvenes.
