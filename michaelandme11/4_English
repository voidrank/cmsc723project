Maoist protesters became a major spectacle in the series of [anti-Japanese
protests](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/16/china-censor-machine-
suspended-for-anti-japan-mobilization/) in China that took place between
September 15 – 18, 2012, with Chairman Mao's portraits and nostalgic slogans
praising the nation's founder standing out in the crowds.

To many intellectuals the Maoists’ return to the Chinese political scene
carries the bitter memories of the rounds and rounds of political campaigns
and prosecutions, such as the [Cultural
Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), in Chinese
history. That's why the incident of an 80-year-old man being beaten up by a
Maoist Professor Han Deqiang during the rally in Beijing on September 18, has
caught a lot of attention on Chinese micro-blogging platforms in the past few
days.

**Maoist leftists in the anti-Japan protests**

Lao Ye [shared](http://weibo.com/1400060484/yCuOTpzZ0) [zh] his observations
in his micro-blog about the return of Maoists in the anti-Japan Rally in
Beijing:

> 【从“小平您好”到“毛主席，人民好想您”】9月18日，北京学生和群众举行抗曰游荇。毛泽东的画像和标语异乎寻常的多。有学生打着“毛主席，人民好想您”的横幅。84年学生打着“小平您好”的横幅，曾作为历史的一个标志。但是今天，没有看到任何人举邓的画像或标语。这种变化值得关注

Incidentally, a drama happened during the rally in Beijing. While the Maoist
protesters were chanting “Chairman Mao, people really miss you”, an 80-year-
old anti-Japan protester yelled at them: “Miss my ass!”

One of the protesters beat up the old man and called him a “traitor”. A
blogger later [identified](http://weibo.com/2803668821/yCzbMi13z) [zh] the
attacker to be [Han Deqiang](http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article285), a
famous Chinese nationalist and founder of Maoist website
“[Utopia](http://book.wyzxsx.com/article.php?id=1888)“, who teaches at the
[Beihang University in Beijing](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/).

Later, an [aggressive
statement](http://club.kdnet.net/dispbbs.asp?boardid=1&id=8640049&page=1&uid=&usernames=&userids=&action=)
[zh] written by Han was circulated widely in many blogs and forums:

You may find it surprising that quite a number of netizens have actually
expressed their supports for Han [zh]:

Of course there are also opinions against the aggressive Maoists; below is a
