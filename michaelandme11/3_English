David DeGraw, one of the early participants of the [99%
movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_the_99%25) has explained about
the birth and development of the Occupy Wall Street protest in a one year
anniversary video (the first interview he has given in six months).

[Interviewed by Cenk Uygur](http://ampedstatus.org/another-world-is-happening-
occupy-wall-street-anniversary-interview/ "Cenk Uygur interviews David DeGraw
99% movement") for the TV program ‘The Young Turks’, he touches on the
emergence of the movement, the organization's pitfalls, how hard it was to
unify such a diverse group people, the expectations to have him become a
spokesperson of a leaderless organization, and also the triumphs of the
movement.

As quoted by [AmpedStatus.org](http://ampedstatus.org/another-world-is-
happening-occupy-wall-street-anniversary-interview/ "AmpedStatus.org quote on
Occupy anniversary "), the 99% media outlet was what opened a new generation's
eyes to see that they could make a change:

> This is about empowering a new generation to be leaders, to be engaged. […]
> We have millions of people engaged in creating change that were not engaged
> and creating change a year ago. […] Occupy globally is the big bang of
> humanity’s next phase of evolution. It created this wild new ecosystem of
> mass transformation. Millions of people turned on, let out of the propaganda
> cage. The first step is that you have to open the prison door so people can
> come flying out and realize that we can change things. You say another world
> is possible. Now, another world is happening.

For the future, there is the need to get money to fund the movement, but
DeGraw is quite closed about what the next big step will be. On [his tumblr
blog](http://daviddegraw.tumblr.com/post/25934699845/occupy-evolver-time-to-
flip-the-protest-script "Occupy Evolver tumblr blog post David DeGraw"), he
speaks about the evolution of the movement and where it should be going in the
future:

> It’s time to flip the protest script »
>
> Instead of protesting what we are against, let’s rally around what we are
> for.
>
> We need to occupy & amplify the solutions. Let’s occupy the forces that are
> evolving our society to a sustainable and prosperous future, for the 100%.
>
> Let’s hold rallies around successful alternative monetary systems,
> alternative energy, alternative education, alternative media, alternative
> food, alternative healthcare, alternative systems of governance.
