Tens of thousands joined the ‘Himpunan Kebangkitan Rakyat’ (literally
translates to Uprising of the Citizens Rally) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
yesterday, January 12, 2013, organised by the Opposition coalition Pakatan
Rakyat as they ramp up efforts in the lead up to the yet-to-be-announced
general election that must occur this year.

The rally highlighted the
[Bersih](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/04/30/malaysia-thousands-joined-
bersih-3-0-protest/) demands (for free and fair elections), the campaign for
free education, and protection of the environment. [The Malaysian
Insider](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/between-70000-to-100000-at-
kl-rally-says-bar-council/) cites information from the Malaysian Bar Council
that between 70,000 and 100,000 people attended the rally.

Many Malaysian bloggers appear to be very supportive of the cause like [Secret
Garden](http://mysecondkingdom.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/kl112-rally.html):

> Although I am not able to present myself there physically, but I am always
> with those who strive after a cleaner and fairer government, both mentally
> and spiritually.
>
> The unprecedented success of Rally KL112 shows that our people (including
> myself) have finally awaken to the corrupted and errant government.
>
> Thanks to advanced technologies and uncensored net, we are no longer
> blindfolded by main streamed media and government. That's why the rally is
> named as “People's Uprising”.

[Ipohgal](http://188hughlowstreet.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/himpunan-
kebangkitan-rakyat-kl112-all-well-ends-well/) provided a summary of the event
from her perspective:

> Many came with salt, mineral water and towel, ready to face another round of
> tear gas and water cannon. Surprisingly, the police presence was minimal and
> there was a carnival atmosphere. Traders were doing good businesses selling
> T-shirts, souvenirs, foods and drinks around Stadium Merdeka.
>
> About 50,000 to 60,000 people managed to pack into the Stadium and spent the
> hot afternoon listening to fiery speeches by the NGO’s and political
> leaders. Malays, Chinese, Indians, Eurasians, Ibans, Dayaks and the Orang
> Asal were all there. Young and old, male and female, came out in full force.
>
> It is comforting to see total strangers standing or sitting together in
> solidarity. We were one people with one spirit. We were truly and proudly
> Anak-anak Bangsa Malaysia (Children of Malaysia). We clapped, we sang and we
> cheered with one voice. Everyone helped to pass mineral water around and we
> also donated money to cover the cost of renting the Stadium. Yes, we paid
> the organizers to attend, and not paid by them to attend.

There were also some who were sceptical about it, claiming that the Opposition
is merely trying to engineer a revolution within Malaysia. For instance,
[Aeshah Adlina Karim](http://aeshahadlina.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/pictures-
of-kl112/)posted pictures alleging that some Malaysians are supporting the
Opposition in calling for a revolution that includes changing the Malaysian
flag, supporting Chin Peng (a former leader of the Communist Party of Malaya
who is in exile and who has applied and been denied entry into Malaysia), and
‘legalising LGBT’.

[Dave Avran](http://avran.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/himpunan-kebangkitan-rakyat-
hooray-for.html), instead took a rather neutral and light-hearted take of the
rally.

> Having rallies like today's for example is good for the nation. We have a
> lot of bored people who don't know what to do on weekends and need a reason
> to leave their malls.

The topic has been very popular on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KL112&src=typd), with the hashtag
#KL112 and #HKR112 being promoted heavily by the organizers.

Earlier, Al Jazeera showed a video clip from YouTube of a dramatic
