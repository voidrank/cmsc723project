An interview with [Adam
Dobrzynski](https://pl.globalvoicesonline.org/author/adam-dobrzynski/), a
member of the heavy metal band
[Wanderer](http://www.myspace.com/wanderertheband) and a translator for GV
Poland.

He lives in Warsaw's district of Praga, will soon graduate with a degree in
American Studies and Philology with a focus on teaching. However, from the
beginning of his studies, he was thinking of becoming a translator rather than
a teacher. And even though his biggest talent is his English proficiency, for
the past 10 years it has been music that remained his strongest passion.

**Global Voices (GV): Who is Adam Dobrzynski? A musician? A student? A
translator?**

> **Adam Dobrzynski (AD):** Most of all, I am just myself, music is my
> passion, translation is something that, besides music, I want to do in life,
> something that I’m best at. To be honest, studying is just a professional
> formation. I think one could call me part translator, part musician?

**GV: Is your band a good material for an article?**

> **AD:** I think we are all fanatics of music, we are very determined to
> create something on our own – probably because of that we are still looking
> for our musical identity. We have some of our own material, we can’t
> complain about inspiration…just pass by one of our upcoming concerts.
> Despite some rotations in the band, we remain strong and tight, we want to
> achieve a lot in the world of music.

**GV: What are your musical inspirations?**

> **AD:** Rock and metal most of all, in all its colours and varieties. Also,
> classical music, but just occasionally – sometimes I listen to Wagner. For
> more than 10 years I’ve been fascinated by heavy, fast tones, I think they
> are a perfect carrier of energy.

**GV: How did you end up in the band Wanderer?**

> **AD:** Music is my passion, for the last 10 years I’ve been listening to a
> whole range of rock music, from rather light to very heavy sounds. It’s the
> music that has shaped my character, the way I perceive the world, et cetera.
> At some point, I found time to grab the guitar, I wanted to try myself out
> in creating music that I love and fulfill the dream of playing in a band.
> Despite initial trouble and a short career of my former band, I did not stop
> exercising and finally got rewarded. I got a chance to join Wanderer as the
> second guitar. From the first rehearsals and concerts I felt that this was
> it, that it was worth sacrificing life for playing. We’ve been playing
> together for more than one year now and it is, in my opinion, my biggest
> achievement and pride. Why? Because I live according to the rule that you
> have to fulfill your dreams without counting on somebody else, without
> waiting for financial stability, we just have one life, there is nothing to
> wait for.

**GV: And what was your path to GV?**

> **AD:** A friend showed me this website in May. I thought: “Why not? To do
> something I like, something that is meaningful and to gain some experience?
> Good bargain.” I’ve always wanted to translate and work according to these
> kind of rules, so I took a look at the offer, I filled out the form… and
> here I am.

**GV: Do you think that GV should write more about music?**

> **AD:** Of course, this is something that moves the whole world, that
> connects millions of people. I think that many people would like to read
> information, news (or maybe stories?) from the world of music.

**GV: Are you active in social media? Do you have a blog?**

> **AD:** No, I’m a bit asocial. And besides that, I don’t even have enough
> time to start this kind of activity.

**GV: What is the role of new technology in your life?**

> **AD:** I don’t like changes at all, I’m still using my old Nokia and the
> only “new technologies” I’m investing in are an iPod and a multi-effect for
> my guitar.

**GV: Are you a bit of an activist? Did you take part in the winter protests
against ACTA?**

> **AD:** I don’t consider myself an activist, I’m not a part of any group…
> but I did go to the protest against ACTA. I also remember our first concert
> in Warsaw, we dedicated it to the fight against ACTA, we have sacrificed our
> old T-shirts to make protest banners against this bill. We have expressed
> our “endorsement” for ACTA in the song “Drill” that we played for the first
> time at this concert [unfortunately, the song is not recorded yet].

**GV: Do you think that young people in Poland should get more engaged in
“internet politics”?**

> **AD:** Sure, Internet is nowadays probably the kind of media that young
> people feel the closest connection with. Where, if not there, to express
> your opinions and fight for a better tomorrow? And young people have to get
> involved in politics – they fight for their future.

**GV: In your opinion, how will the world of media look like in 10 years and
what will be the role of citizen media?**

> **AD:** I think everything will speed up even more, the flow of information
> will be even bigger, Internet will be king among the mass media. Social
> media will be the main point of discussion, self-expression and opinion-
> forming, a platform to exchange opinions.

**GV: Would you like to add anything?**

> **AD:** I feel proud translating posts for GV. Why? I’m doing something
> meaningful, I bring the events and stories from the world closer to the
> Polish public. It’s very important.
