After [Bahrain's police “Slap” video went
viral](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/12/25/bahrain-police-slap-video-
goes-viral/) the Minister of Interior issued a statement in which he asked
that “[anyone who films such an event should report it
immediately](http://www.iaa.bh/pressReleasedetails.aspx?id=410)” to the
authorities. Two days later, and in contrast with such statements, many were
shocked at the news of the arrest of a photojournalist.

Ahmed Ismail is a videographer who was

protest.php) in Salambad last year while filming a protest. He was shot from a
civilian car.

The Doha Centre for Media Freedom issued a
[statement](http://www.dc4mf.org/en/content/bahraini-photojournalist-arrested)
which said:

> The Doha Centre for Media Freedom is joining the quest for information with
> the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights which calls for the immediate
