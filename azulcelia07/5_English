It's clear by now that something has been brewing in Iran. On 28 December,
protests broke out in [Mashhad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashhad) over
the ‘high prices’ of everyday goods and spread to smaller towns and major
cities by 29 December. Theories about what is driving the current situation
abound, with many conjectures and theories being prematurely shared on the
issue.

To better understand the current situation, it is important to look at Iran's
recent history and unpack some of the potential motivations behind these
events. Here is a look at what is happening on the ground, how it differs from
the 2009 protests, and why some people think that there is a lot more to this
situation than meets the eye.

### Scenes on the ground:

These protests have been the first on this scale since the [2009 protest
movement against the re-election of President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Iranian_presidential_election_protests).
As in the 2009 protests, there is a widespread national mobilization against
the status quo; however, these current protests lack the support, and in some
ways, the [leadership of the reformist candidates that the Green
Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Green_Movement) had with Mir
Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. This time, the protest chants seem to
speak about a general dissatisfaction with both the reformist, the moderate,
and the hardline elements in Iran.

Here is what we do know so far: there are protests occurring across the
country; there is footage of various protest chants which outline people's
disillusionment with not only the Islamic Republic's ruling system but also
the moderate government of Hassan Rouhani; there does not seem to be one
collective goal or leader in mind; however, the protesters seem to be voicing
dissatisfaction with unemployment and economic stagnation; there are many
perspectives and interpretations being spread across social media; there have
been fears that the Internet will be cut off; and there have been some Iranian
users reporting some offline connections, disrupted cell services, as well as
VPN services no longer working.

However, in general, the country remains online and the steady stream of
protest footage is coming in from all across the country.

At the moment, the only Internet loss seems to be access to the major social
media platforms Telegram and Instagram. In Iran, there are an estimated 40
million monthly users (in a country with around 45 million users online) on
Telegram and around 20 million on Instagram. Telegram founder [Pavel Durov
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov)tweeted this message about the
situation:

### What is behind the protests?

While many experts are weighing in on the situation, one notable commentator
inside of Iran raised a few questions. Sadegh Zibakalam, a reformist-oriented
University of Tehran political science professor, noted the reasons behind the
protest and some of the peculiar new chants in favour of the former deposed
monarchy. The post was shared widely on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdVriZoBndb/) and
[Telegram](https://t.me/sadeghZibakalam):

Despite the surprising chants in favour of the monarchy, it remains unlikely
their return and support is a widespread theme of these protests, but rather
one type of chant in series of demands, expressions and protests.

There is also a general feeling that the events were spurred on by hardline
elements to undermine President Rouhani. Journalist Golnar Motavelli reports
this theory from Tehran through her monitoring of Iranian media:

According to Golnar however, it seems since the chants in the protests have
taken on the theme of overall dissatisfaction with all the leaders of the
system and that, those who hardline conservatives who may have initially
supported the protests, have essentially lost controlled.
