With the image of the “vulnerable” refugee dominating media coverage, Syrian
painter [Abdalla Al Omari](https://twitter.com/_AbdallaOmari_) wished to flip
the script and show the world how powerful politicians would look like if they
weren't so lucky.

Enter “[The Vulnerability
Series](http://www.abdallaomari.com/thevulnerabilityseries/)“.

He initially launched the series in Brussels, Belgium, in 2016 where he was
granted asylum and re-launched it in Dubai, where it ended on July 6, 2017.

Omari explained his [motivations for the
series](https://www.facebook.com/Abdalla.Omari.Art/posts/1388819587859942):

> Although I knew little about the internal world of those leaders, the
> countless, intimate hours I spent with them have taught me more than I could
> imagine. Just as easily as everything worth defending can become
> defenseless, moments of absolute powerlessness can give you superpowers.

The idea was to break their image of strength. He detailed [on his
blog](http://www.abdallaomari.com/thevulnerabilityseries/) how this made him
pity even Syria's embattled President Bashar Assad, whose forces are regularly
accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity:

> Even I felt sorry for (my version of) Assad. In this universe without
> gravity, all we can hold on to is our vulnerability. This invisible wind
> makes our chest heavy, yet, mysteriously propels us back on our feet again.
> I have convinced myself it is the strongest weapon humankind possesses, way
> more powerful than the trail of power games, bomb craters and bullet holes
> in our collective memories. Vulnerability is a gift we should all celebrate.

In an interview with Belgium's De Afspraak, Omari said the “strange feeling of
empathy” extended to other politicians:

> Everyday I was waking up with them and on my walls.. And there was a moment
> I had this strange feeling of empathy towards them after seeing them for so
> long. And this vulnerable state, looking at you, having eye contact with you
> all the time, telling you that ‘we are vulnerable’, we are weak, even them,
> I had this feeling of ‘wow, I could even empathize with them’.

  
Besides Assad, the series depicts US Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump,
Russian President Vladimir Putin, French Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and
François Hollande, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Turkish President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

“It was my personal desire to see them in the shoes of refugees, of vulnerable
people to see them in their vulnerable state because they always look so
perfect, so divine”, he told De Afspraak.

His widely-shared image of Trump as a refugee was inspired by the story of
Palestinian-Syrian refugee [Abdul Halim
Attar](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/11830463/Syrian-
refugee-receives-40000-in-donations-in-24-hours-after-viral-photo-selling-
pens.html).

Attar, originally from [Yarmouk
camp](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/04/07/the-situation-in-yarmouk-
refugee-camp-has-reached-catastrophic-levels/) in Damascus, and one of over a
million Syrian refugees who have [fled to
Lebanon](http://syrianrefugees.eu/?page_id=72), received considerable media
coverage after he was seen selling pens in Beirut while carrying his daughter.
The girl Trump is carrying is wearing the same clothes as Attar's daughter.

Omari's work has garnered a lot of online attention. One video by AJ+ got over
12 million views. In it, he says that “those leaders were partly responsible
for the displacement of Syrians. Maybe they will feel what it feels like to be
vulnerable.”

Mary Scully, once an independent socialist candidate for the US presidency,
[suggested](http://www.maryscullyreports.com/the-iconoclastic-art-of-abdalla-
al-omari/) taking the imaginary portrayal of world leaders a step further:

> There is another preferable way to portray them: in prison uniforms after
> they've been prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
