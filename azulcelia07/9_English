On July 4, 2017, parents across Trinidad and Tobago were anxiously awaiting
the results of an examination that would determine which secondary school
their pre-teens would attend for the next five years. The [Secondary Entrance
Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_Entrance_Assessment) (SEA)
exam, which was introduced by the education ministry in 2001 as a replacement
for the Common Entrance exam, is essentially the same as its predecessor: a
placement test.

Trinidad and Tobago touts itself as providing [free universal education for
all](https://www.facebook.com/dfhthrth52/posts/10154293728682812), but in
reality not all schools across the country are equipped with the same level of
facilities or trained staff. Schools are also not zoned, so there is great
pressure for children to gain entrance to “prestige” schools, not necessarily
close to their places of residence, in order to secure a solid secondary
education. From the ministry's point of view, this may be a practical
consideration—there are supposedly more children leaving primary school than
there are secondary school places, hence the need to stream children
academically. But the fact that all youngsters who sit the exam are placed in
a school blows a hole in that argument.

The examination ends up being a mechanism through which students who test well
end up at better schools. Social class and connections are also a factor.
Parents have been known to pull strings in order to get their children into
schools of their choice.

Every year, parents complain about the test and call for the ministry of
education to do away with the exam, but nothing changes. A former employee of
the ministry explained it this way: “If they decided on zoning, it would mean
that a whole lot of schools would need work to get them up to standard across
the board. Which parent would be prepared to sacrifice their child by having
him or her attend those schools while the upgrades are being made? I can't
name one. And that's exactly why the SEA exam will continue to exist.” This
despite the fact that the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has [expressed
concern](http://www.barbadostoday.bb/2016/10/19/low-grade/) that “the
Caribbean and Latin America was the region with the largest learning gaps,
while pointing out that children from wealthy families were learning a lot
more than those from lower socio-economic families.”

Educator Patrice Cox-Neaves told Global Voices that in the mid-1990s, the then
Chief Education Officer, Dr. Claudia Harvey, created an education plan that
involved assessment of children's portfolios by a panel of independent subject
experts at different stages of their school careers. If, at the Standard 2
stage (8 years old), there were learning gaps, children would be kept back and
given access to remedial courses. Their coursework in Standards 3 and 4, the
years when academic pressure for the upcoming exam usually starts to build,
would account for 40%, while their Standard 5 portfolio—the year they sit the
exam—would account for 20% of their final assessment. The three secondary
school choices each child is currently allowed would remain, except that two
of the three schools would be in the area of residence. Dr. Harvey's plan was
designed to render the exam obsolete within five years, but it was never
implemented.

More than 20 years later, the
[debate](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154094370745783&set=a.10152377411455783.1073741827.632415782&type=3&theater)

After the 2016 exam, writer Nazma Muller
[mused](https://www.facebook.com/nazma.muller/posts/10154106326805546) on
Facebook that:

> An education system that rewards a few at the expense of the rest—at the age
> of 11—is not about education at all; it's about divide and conquer. Until
> the day ALL our children – even the disabled – have access to a relevant,
> empowering education that will liberate their minds and prepare them for
> real life, we must fight to dismantle this oppression and divisiveness.

The 2017 exam attracted further ire from social media users because of an
error on the test that caused students great mental anguish. By the time the
results were about to be released, both [family-oriented
websites](http://www.trinikidscorner.com/things-parent-know-sea-results/) and
well-intentioned [Facebook
users](https://www.facebook.com/raymond.wayne/posts/10155779876000579) were
[posting
advice](https://www.facebook.com/kstollmeyerwight/posts/10154474761671831) to
parents about how to deal with the results. It was later revealed that more
than 2,000 students [scored less than
30%](http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20170705/news/2170-pupils-scored-less-
that-30-per-cent-at-sea) on the exam, calling into question the efficacy of
the education system's ability to create critical thinkers.

In a public Facebook post, playwright Tony Hall

There was a lot of talk online about the SEA's elitist tone. Artist Dave
Williams
[said](https://www.facebook.com/davewilldoso/posts/10155721339077573):

> A SUPERIORITY COMPLEX IS AS AWFUL AS SHAME. SEA season has provoked a lot of

In a similar vein, Jill Lian Goddard
[suggested](https://www.facebook.com/gillian.goddard.790/posts/10156359137828761):

> Every year, at this time, I post words of grief regarding the SEA and the

While some social media users were grappling with the big picture and its
daunting effects, others took a more practical approach.

Fulbright scholar Lesley-Ann Noel
[thought](https://www.facebook.com/lesleyannnoel/posts/10154636522301156) it
was time for action:

> Parents it's time for us to develop strategies to boycott and get rid of
> this classist exam!

Criminologist Renee Cummings was [concerned
about](https://www.facebook.com/renee.cummings2/posts/10158979303585068) the
tradition of publishing the results in the newspapers, in light of the problem
of escalating crime:

> Publishing SEA results in the newspaper is a major safety/security risk. The
> entire country has access to such private information. That concept has
> outlived its usefulness, if it ever was useful. Does the Ministry of
> Education secure a release from parents giving permission for the name of
> the child and the school to be published? I find it most irresponsible and
> it needs to stop. Back in 50s, 60s, 70s, it was probably a big thing or a
> proud moment for the entire village or community to see a child's name and
> ‘achievement’ in the newspaper. For the child who didn't live up to
> expectations, it was certainly a public shaming. But in these high crime
> times, it is not safe.

Karel Mc brought the discussion [back to
basics](https://www.facebook.com/karelmcintosh/posts/10154684334852727),
offering parents valuable advice:

> It is at this stage especially that the gap begins to widen between kids who
> have access to prestige education, and those who now gamble with the chance
> of going to a school that is not considered prestige, but may have dedicated
> teachers, or worst-case scenario… not-so-dedicated teachers. And I don't say
> this to be a killjoy, but to make us all aware of the societal gap that
> widens between the child who made 91 and 95 and the child who made 83 and
> 60. We all have made those types of grades – or worse – at some point in our
> lives, but at junctures like these kids feel it in different ways.
>
> Depending on where they go, expectations may decrease thereby decreasing
> children's output. It is even moreso now that our kids need our support,
> dedication, and encouragement. We must sit and read with them, supervise
> their schoolwork, and investigate the quality of education at school and at
> lessons. Let teachers know that we don't play with our kids’ education. Fire
> lessons teachers who are doing minimum for maximum pay.
>
> And we must teach our children to be bold. Some institutions teach our
> children to be sheep. To be slaves. To be buffers. […] Do not let the system
> teach our children to be subservient. They sometimes try to kill their
> spirit and independence. Sociology teaches us that education socialises us
> into serving different purposes in wider society. Do not let a secondary
> school determine who your child is, and who they will be. […]
>
> Our Government and our Ministry of Education are not doing anything to
> ensure that our kids are inspired and empowered in schools. So we must do
> it. […] I hope our future generation will be bolder than us, and create the
> change that we have failed to create. But they need us to place that seed in
