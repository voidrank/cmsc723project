The year of 2017 brought with it an unfortunate [rise of
unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/jordan/unemployment-rate) in
Jordan, hitting a [peak of
18.5%](https://tradingeconomics.com/jordan/unemployment-rate/forecast). The
future does not look so bright either, with 2018 promising an[ even bigger
rise.](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/unemployment-rise-near-future-
due-wrong-policies-%E2%80%98)

For university degree holders, the situation is worse than that of the general
population:
[23%](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180127055034895)
are unemployed. Of those graduates who are jobless,
[27%](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180127055034895)
are men, while
[68%](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180127055034895)
are women.

Tuition fees have
[skyrocketed](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/jordanians-protest-
soaring-university-tuition-fees-151006063919776.html) in recent years, but
those who manage to pay aren't guaranteed a decent living at the end of the
academic road. Graduates who Global Voices spoke with complained that while at
university they had to navigate politics and confusing government job advice,
and afterward they have found themselves stuck with menial and underpaid work
— or no work at all.

“My education has, if anything, hindered my employment,” Lara Mohsen, a former
student at Al-Balqa Applied University **,** told Global Voices.

The education that Lara and many more are referring to is that provided by
public and private universities. Since the form of government in Jordan is a
parliamentary monarchy, the students have to deal with [ever-changing
admission policies](https://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2017/10/jordans-decision-
shake-university-admissions-stirs-controversy/), with each government either
building on or completely changing the policies of the one before it.

Moreover, students often find themselves witnessing [dangerous tribal
clashes](http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/student-rights-movement-says-
uj-clashes-were-tribally-motivated%E2%80%99) on campus since tribal rule is
predominant in Jordan and the inner problems of tribes can often find their
way into educational institutions through youth.

Yazan Bahbouh, who graduated as an accountant from the University of Petra,
told Global Voices that he couldn't see the benefit of his degree:

> I graduated as an accountant from the University of Petra, and I got offered
> a job at a private company almost immediately. I was above the clouds, since
> it is uncommon for a recent graduate to land a job so quickly. The first day
> on the job, I realized I would be counting boxes for inventory. A job that I
> would be performing alongside high-school drop outs at the very same
> company. I resigned only a few weeks after. I couldn’t handle getting paid
> even less than my colleagues who drive the vans, given that they make more
> on tips than I, a person who has spent 4 years of his life getting an
> education.

Dana, a pharmacy graduate, told Global Voices that she was exploited at her
job to do extra work that is not in her job description:

> After five years of college, I graduated as a pharmacist. I found a job at a
> local pharmacy that had a vacancy and started working right away. One week
> into the job, I found out that I must take turns with my other colleague who
> has the night shift to wipe floors, and dust shelves. I thought ‘great, I
> really needed continuous four-hour lab training lectures for this’ and left
> the job immediately.

The story of Yazan and Dana are not unique. University graduates often refuse
jobs that they consider [beneath their level of
education](http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/fahed-fanek/extended-families-
tolerate-unemployment), but with [100,000 new
graduates](http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/fahed-fanek/extended-families-
tolerate-unemployment) looking for jobs every year, the positions that Yazan
and Dana refused could easily be filled by many others desperate for them.

### The difficulty of navigating the market's ‘continuously changing’ needs

Taima, a graduate in translation from Yarmouk University, said that she gets
paid as much now as she did during her freelancing years as a student:

> I used to work as a freelance translator while I was still a student. A lot
> of translation bureaus would demand a degree in translation, so I would
> revert to translating for individuals who just wanted a one-time kind of
> service. I thought that once I graduated I would be able to land those
> bureau jobs and make a better living. You would be shocked to find that I
> now make the same amount as I did as a student.

She continued:

> A [translation] bureau once told me that there is an ‘overflow’ of
> translation and language graduates. Later on, I realized I should have
> contemplated more carefully what to study, since the market needs are
> continuously changing.

Jordan's Civil Service Bureau issues [annual
reports](http://www.mohe.gov.jo/en/pages/Statistics.aspx) on the
specializations needed most in the job market, and what sectors of the market
have reached full employment. The agency also sends advice to the Ministry of
Higher Education as to what majors are not needed in the market and thus
should be shut down, and what majors should accept lower student numbers.

However, universities and students are often skeptical of such reports, given
that they are issued by the government, which many view as being responsible
for the[ unemployment](http://jordantimes.com/news/local/unemployment-rise-
near-future-due-wrong-policies-%E2%80%98) problem to begin with.

The reports often advise universities to exterminate majors that are not
required in the public sector [(such as psychology),](https://www.al-
fanarmedia.org/2018/01/jordan-data-suggests-universities-contribute-
unemployment/) even if there might be demand for them in the private sector.
Moreover, a specialization might not pay off in Jordan due to the current
state of the economy, but could be lucrative elsewhere.

For example, take Rawan, a dual citizen of Jordan and the US. After graduating
from the Jordanian University of Science and Technology with a degree in
veterinary medicine, Rawan was left unemployed for about a year, and has now
decided to move back into the US:

> I love my country, and I love living here [in Jordan], but I also cannot
> stay without work forever. I really thought I would move here for good, but
> the circumstances are not in my favor.

And there are other holes to be found in the bureau's advice, such as the fact
that many people choose to avoid studying a major, whether it's officially
recommended or not, that would require them to open their own businesses, as
the trade policies that the government makes have been [proved as
ineffective.](http://jordantimes.com/news/local/experts-say-eu-jordan-deal-
relaxed-rules-origin-fails%E2%80%99-bring-desired-benefits)

The University of Jordan recently created a new major within its foreign
languages faculty, a move which goes against the bureau report, which advised
that universities decrease the number of students accepted into the
specialization over the next five years.

The new and competitive program at the University of Jordan charges [60
Jordanian dinars (85 US
dollars),](https://www.sarayanews.com/index.php?page=article&id=444076) which
is three times the amount of any other in the faculty. Opening a new major
with triple the charges in a faculty whose degree is said to be redundant by
the government is quite the opposite of abiding by the report's findings.

### The consequences of Jordan's nationality law in higher education

Jihad, the son of a Jordanian mother and a Yemeni father, faces an even bigger
problem. Born and raised in Jordan, Jihad is still considered Yemeni because
the law in Jordan only allows Jordanian nationality to be passed down through
the father.

Therefore, he is required to enroll under the international program at the
University of Jordan. Although he passed the national Tawjeehi (the general
secondary examination that grade 12 students must take in order to apply for
university admission), he is still required to register as a foreigner, and
pays [500 US
dollars](http://registration.ju.edu.jo/en/english/RegPages/Parallel/SpecializationMedical.aspx)
per credit hour while his colleagues enrolled in the competitive program pay
[45 Jordanian
dinars](http://registration.ju.edu.jo/en/english/RegPages/Regular/SpecializationMedical.aspx)
(63 US dollars).

Jihad works a job at a local medical center, earning 550 Jordanian dinars per
month (500 US dollars). At that rate, he would have to work for approximately
22 years to pay for his education (that is, of course, only taking into
account the official credit hours of the program, and excluding the cost of
books, allowance, and [added registration
fees](http://registration.ju.edu.jo/en/english/Pages/ParallelProgram/AddFees.aspx)).

“I could open a whole hospital with the 132,500 US dollars that his education
is going to cost me,” Jihad’s dad joked.

Luckily for others, new regulations issued in 2017 [would
give](http://jordantimes.com/news/local/children-jordanian-women-married-
foreigners-be-granted-new-higher-education-rights-%E2%80%94) the children of
Jordanian mothers and foreign fathers the same higher education privileges as
Jordanian citizen, although that won’t be of much use to Jihad and the others
whom have applied for universities before then. Moreover, [Syrian
refugees](https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/whats-happening-to-
syrias-students-during-the-conflict) and [non-Jordanian passport
holders](https://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2014/04/untold-story-ex-gaza-refugee-
students/) who were born and raised in Jordan (people who migrated to Jordan
from Gaza in the 1948 and 1967 Israeli-Palestinian wars, for example) are
excluded, and thus still have to enroll in the international program.

### Discrimination against people with disabilities in the job market

The stories of students who struggle with unemployment are abundant, but some
face additional challenges like disabilities.

Hakeem is a short-sighted student who studied finance at the University of
Jerash. After struggling through high school and university, he finally
graduated with a 3.2 grade point average in 2015. He remains unemployed until
this very day, as companies would prefer hiring one of the many candidates who
do not have a disability to deal with.

Hakeem's childhood friend, who has himself regularly switched jobs ever since
he graduated, told Global Voices that he hoped an education would help his
friend:

> I wanted [Hakeem] to get an education because I believed that he and I would
> have an equal chance to both study and work, but the educational system has
> failed us.

These stories paint a picture of joblessness in Jordan as experienced by
university graduates, who invested money into a degree that they thought would
bring them gainful employment, but that instead left them with disappointment
in the real world and consequently in one’s country and self.
