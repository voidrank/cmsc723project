The photograph that sparked a heated debate in Brazil. Screenshot from Lucas
Landau's Facebook page.

It's New Year’s Eve at one of the most famous tourist destinations in the
world. While [2.4 million people
](http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/geral/noticia/2018-01/festa-da-virada-em-
copacabana-reuniu-24-milhoes-de-pessoas)gather at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana
beach to watch the fireworks, the lens of freelance photographer Lucas Landau
turns to a young black boy. He is wet and shirtless, standing in the sea with
the water reaching his knees. His hands crossed at his waist, he looks like
he's shivering, but stays there, mesmerized by what he sees in the sky above.
Behind him, out of focus of the camera, a crowd of people dressed in white
cheer, take selfies and celebrate.

Landau published the shot on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and the photo
was soon spread to WhatsApp with a fake story about the boy being homeless and
abandoned. The narrative fit with what some saw in the image: a black boy who
embodied the inequality of Brazilian society.

But those assumptions of poverty and sadness soon encountered pushback.

the perspective:

Interviewed by the Brazilian version of the Spain-based newspaper El País,
black writer Anderson França
[said](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/01/02/politica/1514924485_498274.html):

> O problema não é a foto, é a interpretação dela, do seu contexto. As pessoas
> que olham aquela foto estão pré-condicionadas a entender que a imagem de uma
> pessoa negra é associada a pobreza e abandono, quando na verdade é só uma
> criança negra na praia. Essa precondição é racismo estrutural, que vem da má
> educação do povo brasileiro sobre ele mesmo.

> The problem is not the photo, it’s the interpretation of it, of its context.
> The people looking at the picture are pre-conditioned to understand that the
> image of a black person is associated with poverty and abandonment, while it
> is actually just a black child at the beach. This pre-condition is
> structural racism, which originates from the poor education of the Brazilian
> people about themselves.

The true story, however, remains unknown — not even the photographer knows who
the boy is. After the image went viral, Landau [added a
caption](https://www.facebook.com/lucaslandau/posts/10215003728268819)
explaining the context in which the photo was shot:

> eu estava a trabalho fotografando as pessoas assistindo aos fogos em
> copacabana. ele estava lá, como outras pessoas, encantado. perguntei a idade
> (9) e o nome, mas não ouvi por causa do barulho. como ele estava dentro mar
> (que estava gelado), acabou ficando distante das pessoas. não sei se estava
> sozinho ou com família. essa fotografia abre margem para várias
> interpretações; todas legítimas, ao meu ver. existe uma verdade, mas nem eu
> sei qual é. me avisem se descobrirem quem é o menino, por favor.

> I was working, photographing people watching the fireworks in Copacabana. He
> was there, as were other people, marveling. I asked him about his age (9)
> and his name, but I didn’t hear it because of the noise. Since he was in the
> water (which was cold), he ended up being apart from the rest of the people.
> I don’t know if he was by himself or with his family. This photograph opens
> space for several interpretations; all of them legit, from where I stand.
> There is a truth, but I don’t know which one it is. Let me know if you find
> out who the boy is, please.

### **Another white savior story?**

A
[screenshot](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1594210284006679&set=a.512196692208049.1073741826.100002531676607&type=3&theater)
of someone in the comments section of Landau's post looking to buy a print
copy of the photo — to which he replied with his contact details — began to
circulate. In response, people started digging into Landau's work.

Landau, who is white, has photographed [black communities in South
Africa](http://www.lucaslandau.com/proudly-south-
african/w72e1lx96gkf27mx7wi076acai109z) and [violent
events](http://www.lucaslandau.com/copacabana-riot/) taking place in Rio de
Janeiro’s favelas, where residents are overwhelmingly those of color.

As a result of this dynamic, an expression made the rounds in the debate:
“white savior complex”. According to[
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior), it “refers to a white
person who acts to help non-white people, with the help in some contexts
perceived to be self-serving”.

Regarding the photographer and people's general response to the picture,
blogger Marcelo Rocha, himself a black man, [reminded of a character
from](https://www.geledes.org.br/eu-um-garoto-negro-e-crise-da-srta-morello/)
the US TV show “Everybody Hates Chris”, which is popular in Brazil:

> A personagem Srta. Morello (Jacqueline Mazzarela) retrata uma pessoa branca
> que reconhece seus privilégios, mas de forma tão soberba que realmente se
> acha superior em tudo e acredita que todos os negros dependem de sua ajuda e
> assistência. Vê se em vários episódios a professora do protagonista da série
> Chris Rock (Tyler James Williams) com suas “melhores intenções” tentando
> ajudar o personagem em sua história trágica que criou em sua mente. O
> fotógrafo humanitário de alma negra ainda é lucro pro mercado. (…) Só
> criaram ele pois existe um povo sedento por ser a Srta. Morello.

> The character of Ms. Morello depicts a white person that acknowledges her
> privilege, but in such a presumptous way that she actually believes herself
> superior and that all black people depend on her aid and assistance. In
> several episodes, we see [her] with the “best intentions” as she tries to
> help the main character cope with some tragic story that only exists in her
> mind. The humanitarian photographer with a black soul still generates profit
> in the market. […] It only exists because there are people thirsty to be
> Miss Morello.

### **A reflection of the country itself**

Meanwhile, some have argued that people couldn't help but see the image
through a lens of inequality and sadness given the larger Brazilian context.

Copacabana, an affluent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, is surrounded by
favelas and low-income communities, whose majority of residents are brown or
black-skinned. In Landau’s original post, [one
commenter](https://www.facebook.com/lucaslandau/posts/10215003728268819?comment_id=10215019562544666&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D)
remembered how bus lines coming from the suburbs stopped running that night,
supposedly to prevent young black people from coming to the fireworks
spectacle.

In Brazil, the last country in the Americas to formally abolish slavery (in
[1889](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Brazil)), only a small
fraction ([17
percent](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2015/12/04/negros-
representam-54-da-populacao-do-pais-mas-sao-so-17-dos-mais-ricos.htm)) of the
country's richest 1 percent are black, even though black people make up 54
percent of the entire population. At the current rate, the [wage
gap](https://www.cartacapital.com.br/sociedade/seis-estatisticas-que-mostram-
o-abismo-racial-no-brasil) that currently exists between black and white will
only equalize in 2089.

There is also a representation issue. A
[study](https://www.cartacapital.com.br/sociedade/seis-estatisticas-que-
mostram-o-abismo-racial-no-brasil) by the University of Brasilia revealed that
among all the books published in Brazil between 1965 and 2014, only 10 percent
were written by black authors. It also showed that around 80 percent of the
main characters in fiction books were white. In films, only 4 percent of the
productions employ black screenwriters and only 31 percent cast black actors —
who almost always play characters associated with poverty and criminality.

Brazil is undeniably a country with a racism problem, even though it never had
an official segregation law. As Brazilian photographer Fernando Costa Netto
also pointed out, in an [El
Pais](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/01/02/politica/1514924485_498274.html)‘
quote:

> Mesmo que a foto aponte outra coisa quando encontrarem o menino, o Brasil
> está muito bem espelhado pela foto em Copacabana”, avalia Netto. “Nós
> estamos aqui discutindo a força e o papel da fotografia, preconceito, o
> réveillon no Rio, a estética, a emoção, o documento, questionando… A
> fotografia está cumprindo o papel.

> Even if the photo points to another direction once we see the boy, Brazil is
> mirrored pretty well in the Copacabana photograph(…) We are here debating
> the role and the power of photography, we are debating prejudice, Rio’s New
> Year’s eve, aesthetics, emotion, documentation, questioning
> ourselves…Photography is fulfilling its role.
