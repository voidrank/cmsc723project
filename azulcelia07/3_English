_From 1990 until 2000, Peru was under the authoritarian right-wing rule of
President Alberto Fujimori. About 2,000 kilometers away in Venezuela, leftist
President Nicolas Maduro has held an ever-tightening grip on power in his
country since 2013._

_Javier Torres sees many similarities between the two, even if they occupy
different ends of the political spectrum. Torres is director of a non-
governmental organization called Servicios Educativos Rurales (Rural Educative
Services) and a political analyst for Poder magazine and the[
](https://lamula.pe/)[Lamula.pe ](https://lamula.pe/)website. _

_In 2012, when the[trial against
Fujimori](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicio_a_Alberto_Fujimori) began for
human rights violations, he was executive secretary of the National Commission
of Human Rights, where he promoted a legal strategy and citizen mobilization
to bring Fujimori to justice. _

_The following is a re-edited version of an interview with Torres conducted[

**Rafael Uzcategui (RU): What are the main similarities between the Nicolas
Maduro and Alberto Fujimori governments?**

> **Javier Torres (JT)** : There are several. In order for a country to be
> democratic there must be separation of powers, a free press, and free
> elections. There are other elements, but these are fundamental. Both in
> Fujimori's Peru and in Maduro's Venezuela, no separation of powers exists.
> The [emergency laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Emergency_laws)
> that are executed, as much as the changes or violations that these rulers
> make, form the scene of a dictatorship, there is a distinct similarity.
>
> The second has to do with the subject of freedom of expression, which is a
> factor one has to consider under certain conditions. Elections do not
> guarantee that a democracy exists if the electoral system does not comply
> with the minimum laws it must have to function – electoral calendars, for
> example. An electoral system must be standardized and not be subject to
> vagaries of the executive role, which is happening in Peru a little and is
> also what one sees taking place in Venezuela. It seems to me that what they
> have is a dictatorship like the one we suffered under.

**RU: Have you encountered resistance among social movements, particularly in
the Southern Cone, against classifying the Fujimori government as a
dictatorship?**

> **JT** : Dictatorships not only learn but are sophisticated in their
> methodology. In the Peruvian case, due to having characteristics of a
> privatization goal, there was no resistance at the beginning. Fujimori had
> the Congress closed and then held an election where fraud allegations were
> raised. Then the Constitutional Court intervened the following year. Even as
> early as 1990 or 1991, what we have in Peru is the building of an action
> that will reaffirm that blow: The Fujimorist aim was a totally anti-
> political appeal, absolutely against the search for compromise. It was an
> approach based upon denouncing politics as useless, that democracy doesn't
> work so we must be pragmatic. That started to justify the act of
> privatization.
>
> There wasn't a big debate in Peruvian civil society about the dictatorship
> as it formed, which could be Venezuela's case too, but I think a lot has to
> do with how [Venezuela's] regime is viewed from outside. Other countries see
> it as a leftist government that has generated social platforms. That's where
> the problem arises, the ideological activity is generating a kind of
> resistance to call it a dictatorship.

### **About transitions**

**RU: There has been a debate in Venezuela about how conflict resolution
should unfold: transition by collapse or transition by resolution. In Peru's
case, how did the incumbent coalition break down?**

> **JT** : In Peru's case, a transition came near the end of the regime
> because there was a collapse. [It is true that] as early as 2000 a dialogue
> table had already been in place [but it was because of allegations] of
> election fraud in the past. However, around the beginning of Fujimori's
> third term, most popular mobilizations were neutralized, mostly because of
> exhaustion.

**RU: According to what you've said before, another key moment in Fujimori's
fall was the loss of the popular support he had had in his first years in
power.**

> **JT:** There was a moment in his electoral campaign, for the first time in
> that whole decade, where Fujimori began to be rejected by a few localities.
> No one would have dared to hold an opposition demonstration before. The
> important thing is that it wasn't pre-planned, everything was unfolding
> spontaneously. “Fujimorism” was wearing out. These kind of regimes refuse to
> leave though an electoral way. They are so steeped in corruption that they
> have to stay in power.

### **Participation, dialogue and consensus**

**RU: If you are convinced these authoritarians cannot be removed by
elections, is there any reason to participate in processes organized under
unfair conditions?**

> **JT** : That is a matter of debate, because these processes can legitimize
> third parties that could be fraudulent, but they understandably attract
> people's attention. People may not go to vote, but they are attentive to
> what is happening. Elections can be a kind of sounding board, so some
> participate to voice their part. But when you understand the logic of
> abstention, you realize it is always very difficult to achieve a total
> abstention from a whole political force. That way, the non-participation of
> some gives opportunity to others.
>
> The other thing is that every empty seat is occupied. If an empty seat is
> left open to the regime, then the regime will sweep everything. People don't
> always necessarily see any of it beforehand, they only see the fraud
> afterwards, when they see the evidence. It is a subject that is seen after
> its happens.

**RU: Because of the nature of conflict, mechanisms of dialogue should be
promoted. How can this be done in adverse situations?**

> **JT** : There comes a time when those political parties perceive their own
> lack of legitimacy and accept that a civil society organization or others
> that take the initiative to build bridges be seated at the negotiating
> table, and they are shown that there is a common goal: the return of
> democracy.

### The return of democracy

**RU: What would you consider to be the liabilities of a democratic transition
process in Peru?**

> **JT:** Any transition process, especially in Peru's case, involved key
> issues like justice system reform. It did not progress as quickly as it
> should have, which was not the case of the electoral system. We rebuilt [the
> electoral system] in record time. In four months it went from being an
> institution under the Intelligence Service's control to being under the
> citizens’ control.
>
> In the judicial case, there was no full commitment to reform and there were
> too many powers installed in the justice system. Another point was the issue
> of the fight against corruption. Progress was made in sanctioning a group of
> actors, but unfortunately the locks were not kept in place to prevent it
> from happening again.

**RU: Have these liabilities kept the door open for an eventual return of
Fujimorism?**

> **JT** : That's where political system reform comes in. The parties have
> been rebuilt, but many of them are not transparent and do not reveal their
> funding sources. A party law was made but the issue of financing was
> omitted. Evidently, that always carries the danger of turning to silver
> bullet solutions.
>
> The figure of the _caudillo_ (a leader, a warlord, a strong man) is very
> present in the DNA of Latin American political history. This makes people
> feel disaffected and believe that somehow democracy fails to solve their
> problems.
