Afghanistan's jagged, sky-scraping mountain ranges have over centuries been
its best defence against foreign invasions, but there are other ways they can
be put to use for the country.

Since 2011, the annual [Afghan Ski Challenge](http://afghanskichallenge.com/)
has run from February through March in the Koh-i-Baba mountains, not far from
where the Taliban infamously
[bombed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1326063/After-1700-years-
Buddhas-fall-to-Taliban-dynamite.html) giant Buddha rock carvings in the
country's central Bamyan province.

Here there are races for both professionals and amateurs, in which mostly
Afghan skiers compete against each other and a handful of international
rivals.

The event is organized by the [Bamyan Ski](http://www.bamyanskiclub.com/)[
Club](http://www.bamyanskiclub.com/), a Zurich-based not-for-profit
organization founded six years ago with the aim of promoting skiing and
tourism in Bamyan.

### Real backcountry

Covered by snow for six months of the year, the Baba range would seem a far-
flung option for foreign adventurers seeking their next backcountry skiing
fix. Moreover, Afghanistan is regularly portrayed as devastated and overrun by
militants in international media.

But Bamyan province, while poor and [ignored by the central
government](https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/07/afghanistans-hazaras-do-not-
eliminate-us/), is safe from the dangers of the Taliban and ISIS, and open to
both local and international tourism.

Since 2011 an average of more than [30
skiers](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/oct/21/skiing-in-afghanistan-
its-one-hour-up-and-two-minutes-down) from countries like Australia, New
Zealand, the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, and the
United States have visited Bamyan annually, a trickle organisers of the Afghan
Ski Challenge hope will grow over time.

Many come simply for the adventure. Backcountry skiing — as opposed to alpine
skiing — grew up as a North American cottage industry but has turned into a
movement expanding into some of the least-traveled-to countries on the planet.
It thrives on virgin snow and a general absence of the infrastructure found in
ski resorts, such as chair and button lifts.

In February 2012, the first ski school was
[launched](http://bokhdinews.af/news/6982-%DA%AF%D8%B4%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%85%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D8%B3%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86)
in Bamyan by Rah-e Abrishom Travel and Tours, providing ski trainings for as
many as 60 young Bamyanis in its first one-month course, led by two foreign
trainers.

There are presently [five](http://khabarnama.net/blog/2017/01/10/winter-ski-
in-bamyan-provence-of-afghanistan/) local ski clubs in Bamyan with over 200
members in total. Meanwhile, the [Afghanistan Ski
Federation](http://skifederation.af/) which was founded in 2015, [gained
membership](http://1tvnews.af/en/news/sport/22849-afghanistan-joins-
international-ski-federation) of the International Ski Federation in 2016.

Most local ski enthusiasts [do not
have](http://www.bbc.com/persian/afghanistan/2014/03/140303_k03_afghan_ski_chellange_bamyan)
the necessary equipment (skis, snowshoes, boots and helmets) which [combined
can run to over
$1,000](http://www.bbc.com/persian/afghanistan/2014/03/140303_k03_afghan_ski_chellange_bamyan).
The equipment used by the skiers for the Afghan Ski Challenge is
[provided](http://www.bbc.com/persian/afghanistan/2014/03/140303_k03_afghan_ski_chellange_bamyan)
by Switzerland, the Aga Khan Foundation, the Bamyan Ski Club and the Bamyan
Tourism Association.

Some, however, [rely on
innovation](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/oct/21/skiing-in-
afghanistan-its-one-hour-up-and-two-minutes-down) and whatever they have at
their disposal.

As one foreigner put it in an interview with the Guardian, “They decided to
copy us – making their own skis from planks of wood and tying them to their
shoes with fabric and rope. Skiing with them is all part of the fun of being
here.”

### **Women ski, too**

Girls have been a part of the Afghan Ski Challenge from its beginning, growing
in number every year. Now, the Bamyan Ski Club has over [30 female
members](http://khabarnama.net/blog/2017/01/10/winter-ski-in-bamyan-provence-
of-afghanistan/), some of whom have been
[winners](http://www.abroadabroad.com/2016/06/21/worlds-craziest-ski-race/) in
Challenge events.

Home mostly to ethnic Hazaras, Bamyan boasts one of the highest rates of
female education in Afghanistan. It was also the first province to be governed
by a woman after the fall of the Taliban.

Women's reintegration into public life in post-Taliban Afghanistan has been an
uphill struggle for the most part. In Bamyan, while [challenges
persist,](http://www.dw.com/fa-
af/%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B3%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AF/a-6492946)
the social environment is more forgiving.

### **Sports and politics**

In Afghanistan sport is political. Since the majority of Afghan cricket
players are ethnic Pashtuns, for instance, some other ethnic groups resent the
game. However, the government has invested significant funds and political
capital into cricket.

Recently, President Ashraf Ghani
[received](http://dir.pajhwok.com/en/2017/04/02/president-ghani-all-praise-
afghan-cricketers) cricketers at his residence upon their arrival from India,
and the government’s Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah [joined
spectators](http://www.khaama.com/abdullah-visited-india-to-support-afghan-
team-in-world-t20-match-against-england-0427) in India cheering the team on at
the T20 World Cup.

Both President Ghani and CEO Abdullah also serenaded the cricket team on their
Twitter accounts:

> What a fab win & what an amazing batting by G. Naib! Thoroughly enjoyed it.
> Would also like to congratulate the fans. Keep it up our heroes!
>
> — Ashraf Ghani (@ashrafghani) [January 6,

Taekwondo is more often associated with Hazaras. Two-time Olympic medal winner
Rohullah Nikpah is an ethnic Hazara, who
[resigned](http://www.afghanzariza.com/2015/02/13/olympic-medalist-rohullah-
nikpah-resigns-in-protest-against-corruption-in-afghan-olympic-committee/blog)
in protest against alleged corruption in the Afghan National Olympic
Committee. Corruption in the National Olympic Committee and the Afghan Sports
Federation have [received regular attention in
local](https://mountain2mountain.wordpress.com/2016/04/10/corruption-in-
afghan-sports-federations/) media.

Skiing meanwhile, has not spread far outside of Bamyan, and has been largely
ignored by the government, despite the Afghan ski federation's ambitions to
[enter two trained Afghan skiers](http://afghanskichallenge.com/) into the
Winter Olympics in 2018.

Agha Mohammad Kargar, who heads the federation, complained in a telephone
interview with Global Voices that “the government has been totally neglectful
of this sport.”

“The budget of the federation is zero, and we rely on donations to cover our
expenses,” he told Global Voices.
