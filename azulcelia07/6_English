One of the most talked about stories on Spanish social networks demonstrated
what it takes to bring neighbours together. The story's thread has made
Pesesín the most famous goldfish in Spain.

On July 2, 2017, the residents of a block of flats in
[Gijón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n) (Asturias, Spain) stumbled
upon a goldfish bowl, a tin of fish food and a note in the hallway of their
building. The note said:

> Me voy unos días de vacaciones y no me dejan llevar a PESESÍN. Necesito
> vuestra ayuda para que le deis de comer, solo se le debe echar una vez al
> día. Dejo la comida y un cuadro para saber cuándo comió.
>
> MUCHAS GRACIAS

> I'm going on holiday for a few days and I can't take PESESÍN with me. I need
> you to help feed him, he only needs to be fed once a day. Here's the food
> and a chart to keep track of when he was fed.
>
> THANKS A LOT

On the note, there was a chart that the neighbours could use in order to
record when he was fed, which started on Sunday July 2 and ended on Thursday
July 13. Without any hesitation, the neighbours adopted the goldfish, feeding
him and noting each feed time diligently. They even left notes and
instructions for their fellow neighbours:

The note that was left with Pesesín that outlined the instructions for taking
care of him. Image shared by Nuria on Twitter.

> ‘¡No echar tanta comida!’  
>  ‘Agua cambiada el viernes 07/07′  
>  ‘Se le cambió el agua a Pesesín el lunes 3 y mientras tanto estuvo nadando
> un poco en el lavabo (1°D), pasolo estupendo!’

> ‘Don't give him so much food!’  
>  ‘Water changed on Friday 07/07′  
>  ‘We changed Pesesín's water on Monday 3 and whilst doing so he was swimming
> for a while in the sink (apartment 1°D) He had a great time!’

It also seems that on Sunday there was a mini-crisis when Pesesín's food ran
out. But this was quickly resolved by the neighbours in apartment 4°, who
bought another tin.

One of the neighbours, Nuria, found the story amusing and decided to share it
on Twitter:

> Alguien de mi edificio se ha ido de vacaciones y ha dejado en el portal a su
> PEZ para que el resto de vecinxs lo cuiden mientras tanto

> Someone in my building has gone on holiday and left their FISH in the

> He's a very attractive fish and is there swimming peacefully whilst the
> whole block is extremely curious as to who left him there.

What Nuria didn't expect was the response that her tweet received. It quickly
went viral, with more than 60,000 retweets and 100,000 likes. Soon, Pesesín
became a trending topic on the social network — and not only in Spain. The
tweet also grabbed the attention of users from Argentina, Mexico and Colombia.

Many Twitter users reacted to the news by praising the community that looked
after the fish:

> Me encanta que vecindario más majo donde vivir que me mudo jajaja me encanta

Other users rightly criticised the recklessness of the fish's anonymous owner,
highlighting — in some cases — the double standards we apply to animals:

> Muy gracioso lo de Pesesín pero dejar el pez en el portal para que te lo
> cuiden los vecinos es tener un morro impresionante.

The national police also weighed in on the debate.

Pesesín himself, who has a Twitter account, gave his opinion on his unexpected
rise to fame:

At the end of the week, we met Yurena, Pesesín's owner. Stunned by the fame
that her pet had garnered, she explained her side of the story during an
[interview with the Spanish TV channel Cuatro
TV](http://www.cuatro.com/cronicacuatro/Pesesin-pez-momento-visitamos-
hogar_2_2401905180.html), in which she said that a trip came up with her
parents, but she couldn't take the fish with her. After asking friends and
acquaintances [to take care of him] without any success, she decided to leave
him in the hands of fate…and the solidarity of her neighbours.

After seeing Pesesín looking well, Yurena felt immense gratitude towards her
neighbours and wanted to express her thanks by leaving another note in the
same spot that goldfish bowl had been during her trip:

[![Nota de agradecimiento de Pesesín a los
vecinos](https://es.globalvoices.org/wp-

A thank you note from Pesesín to the neighbours that had looked after him so
well. Image shared by Yurena Sabio on Twitter.

> MANY THANKS TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURS!
>
> On behalf of Pesesín and with special mention to those who changed the water
> and bought food. Although the food that was left was meant to last a few
> months and now I need to put him on a diet for a few days, he has loved
> getting to know you.

On Pesesín's story's thread, a Twitter user took advantage of the good nature
that the police usually show on the microblogging site, making this
suggestion:

> ¡Hola,[@policia](https://twitter.com/policia)!
>
> Me gustaría que la próxima trama policial que tengáis la llamaseis
> «Pesesín».[#elcasoPesesín](https://twitter.com/hashtag/elcasoPeses%C3%ADn?src=hash)

> Hello, [@](https://twitter.com/policia)police! I would like you to call the

To which the popular account replied:
