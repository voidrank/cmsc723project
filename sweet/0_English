Ehsan Mansouri, Ahmad Ghasaban, and Majid Tavakolli, the three imprisoned Amir
Kabir University students, and told them angrily and authoritatively: “We
warned you several times not to speak anywhere, not to interview, not to
distribute the news about inside ward 209 of Evin prison, and not to meet
anyone, but you didn’t listen and did your own work. Now I have transferred
your children to solitary confinement again, and unless you change your
approach, you won’t be able to visit them or talk to them on the phone… We
haven’t tortured them yet to make you understand what torture means!”
