_Khabgard_ [reminds](http://www.khabgard.com/?id=1187214218)[Fa] us that
Yaghoub Yadali, an award winner writer, is going to be judged in court because
of his novel “The behavior of unrest”. This story was published two years ago
with permission of Iranian authorities and won a couple of awards.It seems
some people complained against some sentences in this book.The blogger says it
was the first time in Iranian history that such a thing happened and it will
have negative consquences for country's writers.Yadali had already been in
jail, for the same reason, for 40 days.
