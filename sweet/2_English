_“Memories from Romania: On the last day I spent in
[[Onesti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One%C5%9Fti)] many of the students came
to the Cancelarie (staff room) to sing carols for the teachers. I had
absolutely no idea they had prepared this, an absolutely delightful memory to
take away :)” – by_ [L-plate big

[Romania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania) and
[Bulgaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria) became [the EU's newest
members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union) Jan.

Here's what Flickr user [_L-plate big
cheese_](http://flickr.com/photos/olenkaolja/) writes about Romania in the
introduction to her [Romania photo
set](http://flickr.com/photos/olenkaolja/sets/72157594168612635/):

> This is a land which seems to have everything. And much of this everything
> seems to have been overshadowed by the developments of this and the last
> century. Now, it does not necessarily mean that Romania has been ruined, on
> the contrary. Her landscapes are a story of recent past and ancient past,
> all defused along one horizon.
