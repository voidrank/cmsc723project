[Sudan's uprising](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/dozens-have-

the iconic image of 22-year-old Alaa Salah [chanting poems and slogans of
resistance](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/10/alaa-
salah-sudanese-woman-talks-about-protest-photo-that-went-viral) while standing
on top of a car in Khartoum, the capital, went viral, bringing global
attention to the revolution. Salah has been likened to Sudan's [Statue of

The original photo of Salah, taken by Sudanese student,[ Lana
Haroun](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/photographer-iconic-woman), has
inspired artists around the world to exalt Salah as a symbol of the
revolution. Artist[ Amado Alfadni](http://www.amadoalfadni.com/home.html),
born and raised in Cairo, Egypt, with Sudanese roots, seized the opportunity
to remix the image with the classic ‚ÄúBint El Sudan‚Äù or ‚ÄúDaughter of Sudan‚Äù
perfume label.

[Created in the 1920s](http://africa-me.com/bint-el-sudan-a-fragrance-across-
the-sands-of-time/) by WJ Bush in London, the best-selling perfume has been
dubbed Africa's ‚ÄúChanel No. 5‚Ä≥ and is worn widely by women throughout Sudan
and East Africa. The ubiquitous non-alcoholic scent ‚Äî a musky mix of jasmine,
lilac and lily ‚Äî was first sold not in exclusive shops but public markets,
eventually becoming an essential part of[
weddings](https://alisonbate.ca/2010/01/09/memories-of-bint-el-sudan/) and
circumcision rituals as a
[staple](http://www.mimifroufrou.com/scentedsalamander/2011/12/bint_el_sudan_the_african_chan.html)
in Sudanese women's lives. The scent triggers notions of feminity, power and
allure. It's also recognized as having [magical and
medicinal](http://africanaromatics.com/sudans-aromatic-culture/) qualities
that stem from Sudan's ancient aromatic and herbal traditions.

Alfadni explains: ‚ÄúBint El Sudan was my mother's perfume and so [it] was a
part of the identity I made for myself as a Sudanese person.‚Äù

Original Bint El Sudan perfume label features a photo credited to Eric
Burgess, who first brought the idea of creating a perfume to his London-based
company WJ Bush & Co. in the 1920s. Photo shared by artist Amado Alfadni, used
with his permission.

The original perfume label featured a photograph of a topless young Sudanese
woman wearing a traditional Sudanese elephant-hair skirt and adorned with
bridal jewelry on her ankles and wrists. It was taken by Eric Burgess, a
representative for WJ Bush's business interests in Sudan.

For decades, the image of this young woman traveled from Khartoum, Sudan, to
Kano, Nigeria, as traders reportedly began using the heady scent as a [form of
currency](http://www.mimifroufrou.com/scentedsalamander/2011/12/bint_el_sudan_the_african_chan.html).

Twenty years ago, Alfadni says, Sudan's Islamic regime changed the original
image of the topless girl to one wrapped in a modest black burqa in alignment
with Islamic values.

Omar al-Bashir ruled Sudan for 30 years (1989-2019) and introduced [penal code
reforms](http://www.mwcoalition.org/quotas/id10.html) ‚Äî based on strict
interpretations of Sharia (Islamic Law) ‚Äî in 1991. Bashir's reforms relegated
women to the status of legal minors and restricted their freedom of movement
by enforcing [strict ‚Äúmorality laws‚Äù](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-
sudan-women-protests/its-about-freedom-women-on-the-frontline-of-sudans-
uprising-idUSKCN1PV1U2) and gender segregation in public spaces. Women have
faced[ flogging and death by
stoning](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/sudan-christian-
women-40-lashes-trousers) for violating these laws.

The modest Bint El Sudan perfume bottles were introduced 20 years ago under
strict interpretations of Islamic law. Photo by Amado Alfadni, used with his

‚ÄúWhat she wears ‚Äî that is actually what women used to dress like in my home
town in northern Sudan,‚Äù Alfadni said in an interview via Facebook messenger.
‚ÄúThe same with [Nubians](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-
explains/2016/09/19/who-are-the-nubians) of Egypt, I am also Nubian,‚Äù he
wrote.

Not much has changed about Bint El Sudan's unique formula in 100 years, but
the clothing of the young woman on the label has been modified over time to
reflect enduring debates about women's modesty.

Bush Boake Allen, the company that produced various Bint El Sudan products
beginning in
[1966](http://www.perfumeprojects.com/museum/bottles/Bint_El_Sudan.shtml), re-
imagined the label with a young woman who resembles the original traditional
Sudanese bride but draped in red to cover her chest ‚Äî a slight modification to
accommodate more modest markets, depending on where the Bint El Sudan products
were sold.

oppression in public and private spaces, among other grievances.

Eventually, protesters called for the resignation of Bashir ‚Äî who is also
wanted for the role he played in numerous alleged [crimes against humanity.

On April 11, after protesters surrounded security headquarters in Khartoum,
[Bashir was arrested by the military
](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/sudan-army-removes-bashir-latest-
updates-190411125048555.html)in what has been described as a military coup ‚Äî
that only lasted one day. General Ibn Auf, Sudan's defense minister, called
for a three-month state of emergency and two-year transitional government led
by the military but [stepped down as the transitional
leader](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/sudan-military-council-ruler-
ibn-auf-steps-190412194737727.html) as protesters insisted on civilian-led
leadership.

Ironically, the spicy, sweet scent of Bint El Sudan **** is[ now produced in a
small factory in Kano, northern Nigeria,](http://africa-me.com/bint-el-sudan-
a-fragrance-across-the-sands-of-time/) ‚Äî a region terrorized by [Boko
Haram](https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/09/world/boko-haram-fast-facts/index.html),
a militant group aligned with ISIS. The tightly-secured factory produces
approximately seven million 12-milliliter bottles per year, at least 80
percent of the world's demand.

While Alaa Salah's image has brought global attention to Sudan's struggle for
regime change ‚Äî and inspiring artists like Alfadni and others to exalt her as
a symbol of the revolution ‚Äî feminists and activists have warned against the
dangers of any single person carrying the burden of revolution, noting that
many unnamed women have come before her and that Salah herself has [received
death threats.](https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/alaa-salah-will-not-bow-
down-after-receiving-death-threats-21004670)

As for Alfadni, he said his decision to remix the famous perfume label with
Salah's image was about challenging notions of Sudanese identity: ‚ÄúI am trying
to represent the image of Sudan away from anger and extremism.‚Äù
