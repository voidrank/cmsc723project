Tuesday, October 16 marked the last matches in the [third
round](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%28CONCACAF%29#Third_round)
of the [Concacaf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF) (Confederation of
North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football) qualification
competition for the [2014 FIFA World Cup
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup)in Brazil. Because the
Federation is one of the largest (due to the amount of islands), the
qualification consists of three rounds where six teams rank for a final round
called ‘[the
Hexagonal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%28CONCACAF%29#Fourth_round)‘.
Those six teams will fight for three and half tickets to the World Cup.

With the classification of these six teams, a qualifying round two years in
the making has started to take shape. Fernando Palomo
([@Palomo_Espn](https://twitter.com/Palomo_ESPN)) [es] lists the six ranking
countries in this Tweet:

> [@Palomo_Espn:](https://twitter.com/Palomo_ESPN/status/258400335473803264)
> México, Honduras, Panamá, Estados Unidos, Costa Rica, Jamaica entran al
> Hexagonal de Concacaf.

> Mexico, Honduras, Panama, the United States, Costa Rica, Jamaica form the
> Hexagonal of Concacaf.

Thus three Central American countries enter among the six best in the
Federation.

Football fans on various social networks have been discussing the
qualification matches. The “marea roja” or the “red tide” (the name that
followers of the Panamanian selection identify with), for example, took over
Twitter last Friday and managed to create a global trending topic under the
label “[Somos Marea
Roja](https://twitter.com/search?q=somos%20marea%20roja&src=typd)” [es] (We
Are the Red Tide).

October 16 was no exception, and although Panama dealt with an agonizing tie
in Cuba, Panamanians celebrated their entry to the Hexagonal in the streets
and on social networks. Felipe Baloy
([@pinbaloy23](https://twitter.com/pinbaloy23)) [es], the captain of the
Panamanian team, posted on his account:

> [@pinbaloy23](https://twitter.com/pinbaloy23/status/258352855759593472):
> Panama Disfruten el pase a la Hexagonal ya habra tiempo de ver q se hizo mal

Meanwhile Honduras, which needed a win to classify, crushed Canada in San
Pedro Sula with a final score of 8-1. Honduran fans also expressed their joy
on social networks, like Héctor Martínez
([@heremaga2009](https://twitter.com/heremaga2009)) [es]:

Costa Rica also qualified in a crushing manner beating Guyana 7-0 in San Jose.
Joel Campbell ([@joel_campbell12](https://twitter.com/joel_campbell12)) [es],
a promising young Costa Rican footballer, commented after the game:

>
> [@joel_campbell12](https://twitter.com/joel_campbell12/status/258428808078688257):
> Primer objetivo cumplido, pero esto apenas empieza, la meta es el mundial de

> First objective completed, but this is just the beginning, the goal is the

The Hexagonal begins in February 2013 and will certainly be full of surprises
and more activity on social network sites. The table is set.
