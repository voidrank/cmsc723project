On June 13, Tanzania’s Minister of Finance and Planning, Phillipo Mpango,
announced the decision to [reinstate a
tax](https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Tanzania-government-proposes-new-taxes-
on-wigs--licenses-/1840340-5156194-h8sw45/index.html) on sanitary pads in the
2019/2020 budget, triggering a major debate on the impact this tax will have
on girls and women.

Last year, the same minister
[proposed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Govt-to-
scrap-tax-on-sanitary-pads/1840340-4612558-view-asAMP-djxsbhz/index.html)
scrapping the sanitary pad tax.

His recent announcement sparked public outrage, especially from women who see
the tax as gender-based discrimination. The minister
[explained](https://tgnp.org/2018/06/15/how-tax-exception-for-sanitary-pads-
twisted-smiled-during-the-2018-kijiwe-cha-kahawa/) that the [tax
exemption](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Tanzania-reinstates-
taxes-on-sanitary-wear/2560-5176202-td1gua/index.html) implemented last year
had not achieved the intended effect — to enable access to sanitary pads at
affordable prices and therefore ensure “better menstrual health management.”

But the exemption did not reduce the retail price of sanitary pads — instead,
it allowed traders to raise the rate of pads and increase their profits.

The minister stated that with this budget, the government will
[reduce](https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/1840340-5160408-view-asAMP-
kpjqrr/index.html) corporate income tax by 5 percent — from 30 percent to 25
percent — for investors who manufacture sanitary pads locally. The purpose is
to attract investors, create employment opportunities for locals and reduce
dependency on imports of menstrual sanitary products.

### The price of periods

The sanitary pad tax announcement comes months after the Deputy Minister of
Finance and Planning, Ashatu Kijaji, hinted that it was a possibility. On
April 23, the deputy minister explained that her ministry had received
complaints from consumers that sanitary pads were still [highly
priced](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Sanitary-pads-prices-still-
high-despite-VAT-exemption/4552908-5090316-vwi7udz/index.html). She insisted
that the ministry was looking for better options that would benefit both women
and the government, and mentioned the sanitary pad tax as a possibility.

Earlier this year, Ummy Mwalimu, Minister of Health, Community Development,
Gender, the Elderly and Children, stated that her ministry had [received
](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Sanitary-pads-prices-still-high-
despite-VAT-exemption/4552908-5090316-vwi7udz/index.html)letters urging the
reduction of high prices on sanitary pads.

The average cost of having a period in Tanzania is 36,000 Tanzanian shillings
or 15.63 United States dollars per year.

The [current prices](http://satf.or.tz/sanitary-pads-tax-scrap-a-positive-
move/) for disposable sanitary pads range from 2,000 TZS (.87 USD) to 4,000
TZS (1.74 USD) depending on the brand.

In response to these complaints, Mwalimu wrote letters to the Ministry of
Finance and Planning and the Ministry of Trade and Industry,
[requesting](https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Zero-Vat-fails-to-cut-prices-
of-towels/1840340-4984498-view-asAMP-p9ji56/index.html) them to direct
manufacturers to reduce the prices on sanitary pads.

Early this month, Upendo Peneza, a member of parliament, requested the
government to set[ indicative
prices](https://dailynews.co.tz/news/2019-06-035cf4c2f124e28.aspx) on sanitary
pads (an average, fixed rate). But the Minister of Industry and Trade, Joseph
Kakunda, explained that the government is only responsible for setting
indicative prices for public goods and services — and sanitary pads do not
fall under that category.

MP Peneza then requested a sit-down between the government and stakeholders to
discuss how sanitary tax exemption can reflect the needs of consumers instead
of rushing to reinstate the tax:

> “Tulikutana na wauzaji/wasambazaji wa pedi, walitueleza kwamba
> wauzaji/wasambazaji wa jumla wamepunguza bei, tena kwa vielelezo, shida ipo
> kwa wauzaji wa rejareja. Serikali lazima ianzishe mfumo wa namna ya
> kusimamia maslahi ya watumiaj wa mwisho.”

> We met with the distributors and traders of sanitary pads in this country
> and these traders, with illustrations, informed us that they had reduced
> prices. The problem was on the retail end, that is where the pricing has not
> been reduced.

In her speech, MP Peneza's said:

> The government has considered women’s opinions, it has considered
> Tanzanians’ opinions, it has considered the opinions from members of this
> parliament and that is why the tax was scrapped. Let us go back and sit down
> with the stakeholders dealing with sanitary pads, from distributors,

> come up with a system of how to protect the interests of consumers. This was
> my move in 2016, this was my move in 2018 when I contributed on this same
> issue.

Various parliamentary leaders also spoke against the reinstatement of the
sanitary pads tax. Zitto Kabwe, MP representing Kigoma Ujiji, argued that
menstruation was biological and taxing sanitary pads was an [injustice to
women](https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/1840340-5160408-view-asAMP-
kpjqrr/index.html).

Special Seat MP Sonia Magogo said that one year was not enough time for the
government to conclude that restricting distributors and traders to adhere to
price controls was impossible.

> “Napinga suala la taulo za kike kurudishiwa kodi ikiwa ni mwaka mmoja tu
> tangu ile kodi imeondolewa. Naona huu ni muda mfupi kufanya tathmini kwamba

MP Magogo went on to say:

### Period poverty

Many women and girls, especially in rural regions, cannot afford sanitary pads
and have to live without them. Dhalia Mbaga, a health specialist, cited
studies that show [91
percent](https://dailynews.co.tz/news/2019-06-035cf4c2f124e28) of shops in
rural areas in Tanzania do not even sell pads and “affordability remains the
biggest challenge,” according to the Daily Nation.

Period poverty is one cause of absenteeism among schoolgirls in rural areas.
Some girls have never seen a sanitary pad and at times, one pad is [cut in
half ](https://allafrica.com/stories/201801230241.html)to share among two
girls. Most times, schoolgirls in rural areas use inappropriate and unhygienic
materials such as[ rags, raw cotton and maize
cobs](http://www.snv.org/project/girls-control-tanzania), according to surveys
conducted by SNV Netherlands Development Organization.

Poor access to water and basic sanitation facilities in schools is one reason
why school girls in rural Tanzania choose to stay home when they have their
period. According to Raleigh Tanzania, [less than half
](https://raleightanzania.org/our-work/programmes-and-projects/water-
sanitation-hygiene/)the population have access to clean water and as little as
16 percent have access to adequate sanitation facilities.

In an editorial for The Citizen, writer Anna Bwana supported the [use of
reusable menstrual products](https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/oped/Why-the-VAT-
exemption-on-menstrual-pads/1840568-5126844-view-asAMP-
qtmfnu/index.html?__twitter_impression=true) such as cloth pads and menstrual
cups because they last 3 to 10 years.

However, in rural areas, where period poverty is prominent, a shortage of
water and sanitation makes it difficult to care for these products.

### ‘Pads are not a luxury’

Campaigners and netizens have taken to Twitter to express their outrage and
advocate against the sanitary pads tax with the hashtag #PediBilaKodi [meaning
#PadsWithoutTax].

Some men on Twitter have shown up as allies who have not shied away from the

Still, the issue clearly impacts girls and women’s lives. One netizen reminds
the world that menstruation is not a choice:
