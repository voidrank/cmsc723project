On the morning of September 2, 2012, one of the most spine-chilling crimes in
the last few years took place in the Dominican Republic: the murder of José
Carlos Hernández (Chiva), a young, 23-year-old Dominican rock musician
residing in Argentina.

The homicide took place at a night club in the National District, only a few
days after José Carlos arrived in the country on vacation. The suspects (who
had known the victim for years) stabbed him 27 times with a weapon that police
identified as a 10-inch rambo-style blade.

Despite the Public Ministry's failure to issue an official explanation of the
events, many said that it was, as Public Prosecutor Yeni Berenice — one of the
most respected judiciary figures assessed– a hate crime. She defined it on her
Twitter account ([@YeniBerenice](https://twitter.com/YeniBerenice)) in the
following way:

According to the hypotheses shared by different government authorities, it is
believed that the killers murdered the young man because of socio-economic
differences, since everyone belonged in the “Heavy Metal sphere,” which had
quite a limited audience in the country. But if the cruelty of the homicide
weren't enough to torment the victim's family and those close to him, the
[Dominican press](http://rosasilverio.blogspot.com/2012/09/jose-carlos-
hernandez-i-parte.html#) [es] tainted the integrity of José Carlos’ memory by
filling different newspapers with value judgements and accusing him of
Satanism as well as diabolic ritual practice because he had piercings, long
hair, and dressed differently.

The accusations were the order of the day and society's most conservative
sectors continued to echo these defamations before they revealed details and
testimonies from the case. Nevertheless, a more liberal faction of the
population declared their marked disagreement with the situation, which ended
up generating heated debates — above all on social networks — about the
different taboos and prejudices that still dominate the Dominican national
imaginary. Diverse personalities with great influence in the country made
their disagreement with the generalized reaction to the crime clear.

For example, Mariana Barrenese, an economist specializing in public policy,
share the following via Twitter [es]:

Similarly, figures in show business like the promoter, presenter, and
television host Yolanda Martínez, posted on her Twitter @YolandaMart [es]:

> Tattoos and piercings do not worry me. What worries me is hate and lack of

On the other hand, writer and communicator Camilo Venegas positioned his
criticism on Twitter towards the poor use of the media and its role in the
perpetuation of society's disvalues, saying [es]:

> The media sometimes become effective advocates of prejudices and anti-
> values, like machismo and racism.

Nonetheless, the debate was not limited to Twitter, as the majority of
Dominican television and radio programming dedicated space to discuss the
issue on a more professional and academic level. Different civil society
organizations joined the discussion, and even to this day, the youth continues
to debate the pros and cons of tattoos, piercings, and prejudices in an
overarching sense.

Authorities still have not officially validated any of the versions that
attempted to explain the incident nor have they announced any measure focused
on easing certain beliefs and considerations that underpin many of the double
standards that even now, in the 20th century, Dominicans harbor as universal
and irrefutable truths. Meanwhile, research continues and social pressure to
clarify the facts intensifies — especially due to the lack of confidence in
the Dominican justice system and the various channels of information.
