Remarkably, it is now a _fait accompli_ that the Ukrainian opposition has
taken control of the country's political process. President Yanukovich's fall
from power was in no small part due to the radical nationalists who made up
the core of the street activists standing opposite Ukrainian riot police for
the last three months. Nationalist parties like Svoboda, and radical
organizations like the “Right Sector” (see this [early YouTube
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDC0lDxinY) [ru] of Right Sector leader
Yarosh talking about taking the fight to “Ukrainian” lands in Russia)
contributed to the eventual victory of the Maidan movement, and now appear to
be in a unique position to influence Ukrainian policy making.

At least this is what Russian nationalists fear — not only that the new
Ukraine will look towards the West, rather than Russia, but that the Russian
speaking population in Ukraine will come under attack from radicals who will
attempt to “derussify” them. The prominence of Ukrainian nationalists in the
opposition movement gives fodder to these fears. A Russian radio-host Ilias
Mercury, for example, tweeted about statements previously made by leader of
the Svoboda party Oleh Tyahnibok:

and

It doesn't matter if such policies will ever come to pass. The very thought of
them scares nationalists who feel that Russian-speaking Ukrainians are also
Russian.

Some Russians blame Yanukovich for this turn of events. Blogger and publicist
Egor Holmogorov [wrote ](http://holmogor.livejournal.com/6160086.html)[ru]
recently that:

> Судьба Януковича – великолепный урок всем мелким тиранам, предающим русских.
> Он мог бы сделать русский язык государственным и править опираясь на русскую
> половину, которая постепенно стала бы русским большинством. Он предпочел
> прямо противоположный путь.

> Yanukovich's fate is a great lesson for petty tyrants who betray Russians.
> He could have made the Russian language an official state language and rule
> relying on the Russian half of the country, which over time would become a
> Russian majority. He chose an exactly opposite approach.

This language map by Kiev National Linguistic University shows the split
between Russian speaking east and Ukrainian speaking west.

In general, language appears to be a major point of contention for
nationalists on both sides. In the past couple of days the new opposition
controlled Rada has passed several laws, one of which was to repeal of an
older law that gave Russian the status of a secondary official language in
Ukraine. This led nationalist philosopher and founder of the National
Democratic party Konstantin Krylov to [proclaim
](http://krylov.livejournal.com/3219503.html)[ru] the new regime “anti-
Russian.” Krylov claims that such laws diminish political freedoms and
Ukraine, and calls for new policy that would allow Ukrainians to easily
acquire Russian citizenship, if they so choose.

Nationalist publication Sputnik & Pogrom also commented on the law repeal,
[saying
](https://www.facebook.com/sputpom/posts/599311876823142?stream_ref=10)[ru]
that it fits with their predictions of increased nationalism in Ukraine in the
case of an opposition win. S&P also criticized Alexey Navalny for supporting
the Ukrainian opposition movement, as it seems contrary to his claims of
looking out for the interests of Russians. S&P also published an [address to
“all Ukrainian Russians,”](http://sputnikipogrom.com/russia/ua/9420/to-the-
all-russian-people/) [ru] in which they call on them to self-organize and
create “Russian national organizations,” because, “that's the only way to
create a European Ukraine.”

Conservative publicist and radio-show host Dmitry Olshansky, on the other
hand, made a [more emotional
appeal](https://www.facebook.com/spandaryan/posts/719145778106243?stream_ref=10)
[ru]:

> Можно себе представить, что было бы, если бы не было 1941 года, и
> существовали бы те, кого убили, и их потомки, – а Рада отменила бы идиш в
> качестве регионального языка.

> You can imagine what would happen, if there was no 1941, and all of those

Truly, Russian nationalists are vehemently against any kind of ethnic
discrimination — unless, of course, they get to be in charge.
