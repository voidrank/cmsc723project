[Child marriage](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/yemen-child-brides) is a
widespread practice in Yemen, especially in the rural areas. The story of the
death of an eight-year-old child bride puts this serious issue under the
spotlight.

In a 2011 Human Rights Watch report, “[How Come You Allow Little Girls to Get
Married?](http://www.hrw.org/node/103334/section/1)” quoting a nationally
representative survey conducted by the Yemeni government and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 2006, 52% of all young girls are married
before age 18. About 14% of girls in Yemen are married before age 15. A 2005
study by Sana’a University noted that, in some rural areas, girls as young as
eight are married. The main underlying cause for child marriage in Yemen is
[poverty](http://www.undp.org.ye/y-profile.php). Fathers tend to pull their
young girls from school and often marry them to elder men for a generous dowry
in order to provide for rest of the family.

Nujood Ali, aged 10, made headlines in 2008 as the world's youngest divorcee,
after escaping marriage to a man who bought her as a child bride at the age of
nine. Today Nujood is 15, living with her elder brother as her father used
proceeds from her book deal, intended to secure her education, to marry twice
and arranged a marriage for her younger sister. Read more about her ordeal

At 10 years old, Arwa had already been married and divorced. Her case sparked
a nationwide debate about child marriage in 2009.

Last week, another Yemeni child bride, an 8 year old, made headlines as she
reportedly tragically died after bleeding to death on her wedding night to a
40 year old “Saudi’ man.

There was an wide international outrage as this story broke out in the media:

Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth tweeted:

Human Rights Watch urged Yemen's transitional government to [set the marriage
age to 18](http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/10/yemen-end-child-marriage) in
drafting the new constitutions order to save the childhood and lives of many
girls.

European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton,
[statement](http://eeas.europa.eu/statements/docs/2013/130913_01_en.pdf)  
demanded Yemen to ban child marriage:

In a follow up note on Facebook, he
[urged](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=626378434068807&set=a.222106194496035.59084.196704400369548&type=1)
the government of Yemen and all governments in Arab and Islamic countries that
do not have laws to prevent crimes violating children's innocence, by turning
them into goods for sale in the market under a slave-coated marriage, to
hasten to criminalize this heinous act and work hard to fight it through the
legislative, judicial and executive authorities. And he also urged fellow
clerks, scholars and preachers to abolish the practice, reminding them of
their obligation to raise awareness about this issue.

The credibility of the tragic and controversial story of the death of the 8
year old has been debatable. Reporter Saeed Al Batati investigated the case in
[Gulf News](http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/a-wedding-a-funeral-or-a-
cover-up-1.1230870) and in this [video](http://gulfnews.com/gntv/news/yemeni-
father-denies-8-year-old-daughter-was-married-and-killed-1.1231845).
Regardless, whether this particular story is true or not, or if it is a cover
up by the government, is besides the point. Child marriage is a major problem
in Yemen which causes the death of many girls, during marriage and child birth
– young victims whose stories do not make it to the headlines. This was not
the first story and certainly will not be the last. The fact is that Yemen's
government needs to stop child marriage.

Yemen's Human Rights Minister Hooria Mashhour also tweeted about the
controversial case:

[The Human Rights
minister](https://twitter.com/Hooria_Mashhour/status/378824338054852608) also
sent a letter to the head of Parliament to approve the minimum age of marriage
in Yemen and to enforce the law. Vocal advocacy to ban child marriage and set
the age limit for marriage has been a struggle in Yemen, long before the
minister's appointment, but has been repeatedly opposed over the years by
conservatives. In 1999 Yemen’s parliament, citing religious grounds, abolished
article 15 of Yemen’s Personal Status Law, which set the minimum age for
marriage for boys and girls at 15. In 2009, Yemen's parliament passed
legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to 17, but conservative
parliamentarians rejected it too and the bill was never signed. Passing the
law is an arduous and long process yet it is only the first step to win the
battle. Its implementation will be the real challenge for Yemen.

Dr. Jamela Saleh Alraiby, Deputy Minister of Public Health and Population
wrote a piece, last year, entitled [The Suffering of Girls Must
Stop](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jamela-saleh-alraiby/child-marriage-
yemen_b_1618547.html)  
She points out:

> cultural and tribal roots, but this challenge gives us more strength to save

She concluded:

Yemen's government and the civil society need to collectively work on this
issue. Passing a law setting the marriage age and implementing it by punishing
those who break it, alleviating poverty and empowering girls by allowing them
to complete their school education and work, countering religious fatwas
through an aggressive awareness media campaign about the harm of child
marriage, can save many lives in Yemen.
