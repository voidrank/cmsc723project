A few days ago, [many claimed that Mubarak's regime has unleashed thugs to
terrorise the protesters](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/01/egypt-
thugs-unleashed-to-terrorise-protesters/). Yesterday, we have witnessed the
first of the so-called pro-Mubarak demonstrators, and again, many people
claimed they are just security forces and thugs under cover. TravellerW warned
of what might happen in the square.

@[TravellerW](http://twitter.com/TravellerW/status/32757680015675392): Several
pro-Mubarak demos heading to Tahrir sq. right now. Shit's getting real.

Today, those pro-Mubarak demonstrators started to attack the protesters in
Tahrir Square.

@[naglarzk](http://twitter.com/naglarzk/status/32794626742034433): Mubarak has
continued to do one stupid move after the next. Latest: his thugs in Tahrir
attacking peaceful protesters.

They are even attacking the journalist and reporters in the square.

@[MennaGamal](http://twitter.com/MennaGamal/status/32792086105292802): If
those people are not really paid, tell me why are they breaking all the
journalists cameras?

And here is one more tweet elaborating more on the pro-Mubarak thugs and where
they are coming from.

people distribute pro mubarak signs in Mustafa Mahmoud, our doorman's son was
holding one.
