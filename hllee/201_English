When earlier this year a small group of Moroccan activists launched a Facebook
campaign asking people to demonstrate on February 20, 2011, no one could
predict that the call would drive a nationwide movement for change. Three
months and a dozen marches, sit-ins and rallies later, the Moroccan
blogosphere is asking where should the movement go from here and what new
strategies to adopt in face of mounting police repression.

For many, the movement has achieved what political parties have failed to do
in several decades: breathe new life into the political system in Morocco and
force the monarchy to concede reforms. But as the movement vows to keep up
pressure on the regime by calling for weekly, nonviolent demonstrations across
the country, the authorities seem increasingly determined to repress protests
in the streets, while at the same time launch a campaign to discredit the
movement.

Some bloggers are suggesting the “February 20″ youth movement should consider
a strategic turn. Others are warning that the repressive attitude adopted by
the regime could ultimately lead to a radicalization of a protest movement
that has so far been careful not to attack the regime head on.

Blogger _Mullionel_ believes that the escalation in police violence could
radicalize the protesters and lead to a situation where authorities could lose
control. He [writes](http://mullionel.blogspot.com/2011/06/morocco-no-one-is-
save-from-almakhzen.html):

> There is an ever increasing danger of serious slippage with the current
> policy of repression. It may provide a fortuitous spark to radicalize the
> majority of protesters who are, so far, calling for democratic reforms and
> not an end to the regime as in Libya and Syria.  
>  Last week's reports have shown officers clubbing a woman holding a child.
> Such scenes showcase how easy it is for events to go out of control and for
> a seminal and powerful scene to happen and to be instantly transmitted for
> everyone, which will lead to an increased radicalization, and a larger
> dissent among the public.  
>  Recent development in neighbouring countries has shown that increased
> repression often leads to bigger opposition because the wall of fear has
> crumbled across the region.

Chana Nawfel is concerned about the polarization of opinions around the pro-
democracy movement, especially, he says, after the violent police crackdown of
last Sunday's (May 29) protests. He [writes](http://nowbi.over-
blog.com/article-a-vos-mouchoirs-75450749.html) [fr]:

> On parle de plus en plus de radicalisation de la rue après les effusions de
> sang du dimanche dernier. Ce n’est pas faux, mais la radicalisation est
> bipartite : Il y a une partie des manifestants qui souhaite désormais élever
> le seuil des revendications et commence à pointer du doigt la monarchie,
> mais il y a une autre radicalisation tout aussi grave : une partie des
> citoyens, non hostile au changement à la base, se radicalise en refusant
> désormais d’y contribuer, à cause de certains préjugés sur le mouvement du
> 20 février ou quelques un de ses membres. Les deux radicalisations se
> nourrissent l’une de l’autre : la surenchère des revendications irrite les
> conservateurs, et la sclérose des royalistes enrage les progressistes; et
> chacun campe dans son ghetto. Cela ne fait que fragiliser la cohésion
> sociale, indispensable à la création d’un contre-pouvoir, seul garant d’une
> réelle avancée démocratique.

We hear more and more about the radicalization of the street after the
bloodshed of last Sunday. This isn't untrue, but the radicalization is two-
way: There are protesters who are now ready to raise the level of demands and
start pointing the finger at the monarchy, and then there is another, equally
serious radicalization, of some citizens, not fundamentally opposed to change
but who refuse to take part because of certain misconceptions about the
“February 20″ movement or some of its members. Both feed the radicalization of
one another: the escalating demands irritate conservatives while the
royalists’ inflexibility enrages progressives, and everyone is camping in its
own ghetto. This only undermines social cohesion, which is indispensable to
the creation of a power balance, the only guarantee of real progress towards
democracy.

Ahmed T.B. warns that if the repressive approach adopted by the Moroccan
police continues, the worst may yet to come. He
[writes](http://cabalamuse.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/moroccan-democratic-
reform-between-the-baton-and-the-kings-speech/):

> The more the government uses violence to suppress demonstrations, the more
> the people will take to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction. We are
> not far from the day when young demonstrators will stop running, and instead
> clench their fists on the throats of those uniformed brutes and their
> walkie-talkie totting commanders. The odds for a peaceful transition are
> slim. I fear the worst is yet to come.

Nadir Bouhmouch is a Moroccan filmmaker and activist. He fears the repressive
attitude of the state is plunging the “February 20″ movement into a monotonous
stalemate. He believes the image projected by the movement is just as
important as the message it intends to convey. He
[writes](http://nadirbouhmouch.weebly.com/1/post/2011/05/moroccos-uprising-
whats-missing.html):

> Recently, the state upped it's efforts to block the people from protesting
> by utilizing violence. Consequently, the people themselves have begun to
> take a different, less coherent and sometimes more belligerent approach.
> This change in attitudes is perceptible: the aesthetic appeal of the
> protests has been significantly compromised. We no longer see the poetry
> circles and freeze flash mobs, we no longer see a significant number of
> women, we barely even see any banners or flags! A protest without something
> to visually designate it's message is a failed protest. The aesthetic appeal
> of a protest is what makes it attractive to the media. The revolution in
> Egypt, for example, provided the cameras of the world with spectacular
> images of diversity in the crowd, creative banners and innumerable flags. It
> had an appeal.

Nadir goes on suggesting a few steps which, he says, could add some color to
the movement:

> 1\. Women must be encouraged to join.  
>  2\. Carry a banner or a flag.  
>  3\. Create an art piece; sing, dance, write, film or paint for the
> movement.  
>  4\. Hold an independent film screening.  
>  5\. Hold an art show.

Younes Benmoumen writing on [Capdéma](http://capdemocratiemaroc.org/?p=394)
shares his fears about the crisis he thinks the Moroccan society is now
embroiled in. He writes:

> J’ai peur de ce peuple que notre gouvernement est en train de nous forger.
> Il est fait de trop de serveurs, de femmes de chambres et de désœuvrés
> débrouillards. Voila pour leurs conditions économiques. Il est fait de trop
> de soumis et de trop de révoltés. Voila pour leurs conditions politiques.
> Ces deux ensembles préparent un avenir inquiétant. Ce n’est pas là une
> société pacifiée que je vois, mais un ensemble décousu, où une part que l’on
> voudra toujours majoritaire, sera satisfaite par peur du pire, et l’autre
> révoltée parce que le vivant.

I am afraid of the kind people our government is forging for us. Too many
waiters, housekeepers and idle unemployed people. So much for their economic
conditions. Too many resigned and too may rebellious. So much for their
political conditions. Both groups are building a worrying future for this
country. This is not a peaceful society that I see, but a disjointed set,
where one part, that we always wish it was the majority, will be satisfied out
of fear of the worst, and the other one revolted because it is living through
that same worst.

Younes continue saying:

> A ces inconscients qui ordonnent la matraque : vous transformez le besoin de
> réformes en envie de révolution. Les humiliations peuvent être ravalées,
> mais point trop n’en faut. Elles se vomissent aussi.

At these unconscious people who order the beating of protesters by truncheons,
you are transforming the desire to reform into a desire for revolution.
Humiliations can be swallowed for some time, but there comes a moment when all
is spewed out.
