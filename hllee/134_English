Alongside the mounting death toll, a massacre is being perpetrated against
Syria's heritage. Little is being said about this issue in both mainstream and
social media.

Did you know for instance that six sites in the country are on the [UNESCO
](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/sy/)World Heritage List? They are the
Ancient City of Aleppo, Ancient City of Bosra, Ancient City of Damascus,
Ancient Villages of Northern Syria, Crac des Chevaliers and Qal’at Salah El-
Din Site of Palmyra. Also, another 12 historic sites are also on a tentative
list.

Since March 30, 2012, UNESCO has been appealing to the world to save Syria's
monuments. Irina Bokova, UNESCO Director General
[said](http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/862/):

> Damage to the heritage of the country is damage to the soul of its people
> and its identity.

The city of Aleppo, in particular, has been caught in the crossfire between
the rebels and the regime's army. This has prompted once more the [UN
institution](http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/926/) and its affiliate, the [World
Heritage Committee ](http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/926/)to raise the alarm.

Destruction, pillaging, looting and illicit trafficking … this is the fate of
a treasure which has survived for thousands of years.

In order to document the damage targeting Syria's history, a
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Archeologie.syrienne) page and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/SyrianArchaeological) account have been
created on under the title ‘The Syrian archaeological heritage under threat’,
with information available in Arabic, French, English and Spanish.

No information is available on the real identity of those behind that page but
it seems they are a group of Syrian or expatriate archeologists, who have
worked in the country.

In one of the notes we can read this [plea](https://www.facebook.com/notes/le-

Here is for instance an example of the destruction at the [Historic district
of Bab Al Dreib in
Homs](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.357149667686697.72817.168536393214693&type=1):

The once very famous Citadel of Aleppo

[![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

A block of stones, this is what the the Famous Aleppo Citadel is becoming

The ancient souk in
[Midan](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.351139431621054.71056.168536393214693&type=1)
also suffered damage:

[![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

This is how the old souk in Midan District in Damascus has become

On YouTube, a number of videos show the extent of the damage of some historic
sites. Here is a sample:

This is the Mosque of Abu Ubeida al Jarrah in Tell Bysse being bombed:

The state of the old town of Aleppo

Monastery of Saidnaya hit by a shell:
