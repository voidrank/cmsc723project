Gazans stayed up all night as Israel continued to pound the Palestinian
enclave. The situation flared up when Israel and Gaza exchanged fire – which
still continues now – after Israel killed Hamas military leader Ahmed Al-
Jabari during an air raid on Gaza yesterday.

According to Press reports, the current bout of fighting has left up to 13
Gazans and three Israelis dead. On Twitter, Ebaa Rezeq breaks down the toll on
the Palestinian side:

> الحصيلة حتى الآن| 15 شهيد (منهم 3 أطفال, سيدة حامل بتوأم, وعجوزين) + 140
> إصابة. #غزة

> [@Gazanism](https://twitter.com/Gazanism/status/269089736294014976): The
> toll until now: 15 martyrs (among them three children, a woman pregnant with
> twins and two elderly people), plus 140 injured #Gaza
