[Extremists severely wounded](http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-70819-TTP-say-
they-are-behind-attack-on-Malala) a 14 year old education for girls activist,
Malala Yousufzai.

Malala was intercepted by the Taliban, and bullets were fired on her as [she
was returning home from school](http://dawn.com/2012/10/10/14-year-old-
activist-shot-and-critically-wounded-taliban-threaten-to-attack-again-if-
malala-survives/). A bullet pierced through her neck that had put her life in
acute danger. [Recent media reports say](http://dawn.com/2012/10/10/doctors-
to-decide-if-malala-needs-treatment-abroad/) that the bullet has been
successfully removed, and the girl is out of danger.

#### Who is Malala Yousufzai?

Malala Yousufzai is a [Swat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swat,_Pakistan) girl
and an ardent education for girls activist. She openly speaks for the right of
girls to attend school. Moreover, she publicly criticised the Taliban's attack
on girl schools in the Swat valley.

She came on the global scene in 2009 when she wrote a diary for BBC URDU. The
‘ _[Diary of a Pakistani
Schoolgirl](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7834402.stm)‘_ originally
appeared on BBC URDU with an anonymous pen name of ‘Gul Makai’. The chronicle
speaks about the atrocities Taliban did against girl education in the swat
valley.

During the time when extremists controlled swat, girl schools were forcefully
closed down and right of education was exclusively granted to boys. It was
Malala who wrote down about the atrocities committed by the Taliban. Here is a
small excerpt from her diary:

> Only 11 students attended the class out of 27. The number decreased because
> of Taleban's edict. My three friends have shifted to Peshawar, Lahore and
> Rawalpindi with their families after this edict.

Malala Yousufzai was also
[nominated](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248376698562000&set=a.248376695228667.60837.247676535298683&type=1&theater)
for the International Children’s Peace Prize by advocacy group Kids Rights
Foundation in 2011.

She is the voice for the thousands of girls who want to be educated, and play
their role in the uplift of the society.

#### Taliban's Stance

The banned terrorist group, [Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan
(TTP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan), swiftly
accepted the responsibility of this horrendous act. The groups says that
Malala's work was [spreading moderation](http://dawn.com/2012/10/10/taliban-
use-islamic-shariah-to-defend-malala-attack/) in the society and ‘whomsoever
will commit so in future too will be targeted again by TTP’. [Taliban
spokesperson also said](http://dawn.com/2012/10/10/taliban-use-islamic-
shariah-to-defend-malala-attack/) that “whom so ever leads a campaign against
Islam and Shariah is ordered to be killed by Shariah.”

TTP spokesmen, Ehsanullah Ehsan, [said in an
interview](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/pakistani-
activist-14-shot-by-taliban/):

> [Malala] has become a symbol of Western culture in the area…[and the attacks
> were justified because] she was promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas.

#### Societal Reaction

The attack was criticised across every spectrum in the society. Not a single
tweet was present that supported the Taliban's justification of gunning down a
14 years old innocent bairn.

Twitter users condemned this attack in the severest words:

Mubashar Shah [comments](http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/14291/malala-

Pervez [says](http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/14291/malala-yousafzai-my-
small-video-star-fights-for-her-life/):

A flood of netizen prayed for the better health of Malala. They took a deep
breath when the news came that Malala is out of danger.

Feroz [writes](http://dawn.com/2012/10/10/malala-yousufzai-sok-daa/):

> I hope the inspiration shown by Malala will make a marked impact and the
> younger generation throws up Malala like souls in the thousands. Those

> possible. Malala, the entire world is praying for your speedy recovery.

The female literacy rate in Pakistan stands at a low
[45%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Pakistan#Literacy_rate)
(2009). The threat by Terrorist against female education will take this number
to new lows.

Adam B Ellick[ recalls](http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/14291/malala-
yousafzai-my-small-video-star-fights-for-her-life/) about the time he spent
with Malala Yousufzai. Malala took him to her ruined school that was converted
into debris. On the wall of the her school it was written: ‘This is Pakistan’.
Upon seeing this, Malala said impromptu:

> “Look! This is Pakistan. Taliban destroyed us.”
