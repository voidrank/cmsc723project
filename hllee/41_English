A view of Gaza at the time of the ceasefire, taken by Dan Cohen

On August 26, [Israel](http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel "More from the
Guardian on Israel") and the Palestinian factions agreed to halt fighting
indefinitely, putting an end to seven weeks of catastrophic destruction and
loss of life in Gaza.

At least 2,137 Palestinians were killed, including 577 children, and 10,870
wounded, since Israel launched a massive offensive called Protective Edge
against the 40-kilometer-long coastal strip on July 8.

This was Israel's third military operation in Gaza in the last six years.
Excessive restrictions from Israel in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and
the West Bank aggravate conditions in areas that most of the world and the
United Nations considers
[occupied](http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/menaregion/pages/psindex.aspx) by
Israel.

Seventy-two percent of Palestinians killed in this offensive were civilians,
[according to the
UN](http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_sitrep_15_08_2014.pdf). [About a
third](http://euromid.org/en/article/604) of the wounded children, will be
forced to live with permanent disabilities. [One-
third](http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_sitrep_05_08_2014.pdf) of
Gaza's total population, over 520,000 people, have been displaced of whom
279,389 were taking shelter in 83 UN-run schools.

**The deal**

[Hamas](http://www.hamasinfo.net/ar/) and Islamic Jihad – the main Palestinian
militant groups involved in this conflict and
[Israel](http://www.gov.il/firstgov/english) agreed to an Egyptian-brokered
peace deal , which seems similar to the one reached in 2012 after Israel's
“Operation Returning Echo”. Mahmoud Abbas also took part in the deal, his
[Palestinian Authority (PA)](http://www.fateh.ps) has been exclusively
governing the West Bank since Hamas won elections in Gaza in 2007.

The [immediate demands of the peace
deal](http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5N0QW4JY20140826?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true)
include: the end of hostilities on both sides; opening of the Rafah border
between Egypt and Gaza; handing over administration of Gaza's borders from
Hamas to the PA, reconstruction of Gaza in coordination with the PA and
international donors, including the EU; narrowing the security barrier along
the inside of the Gaza border from 300 to 100m, easing restrictions on fishing
in Gaza from 3 miles (4.8km) to 6 miles (9.6km). The international allowance
is 12 miles (19.3 km.)

[The long-term
demands](http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5N0QW4JY20140826?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true)
to be negotiated are: the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
kidnapped by Israel in June after the killing of three Jewish teenagers in the
West Bank; the release of long-serving Palestinian prisoners as demanded by
the Palestinian Authority; Israel wants all body parts and personal effects of
Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza; Hamas wants a sea port built in Gaza in order
to allow goods and people to move freely; Hamas wants the un-freezing of funds
to allow it to pay 40,000 police, government workers and other administrative
staff who haven't had any salary since last year; Palestinians are asking for
Gaza's airport, built in 1998 and destroyed in 2000 by Israel, to be rebuilt.

In Gaza, reactions to the ceasefire were divided. While everyone rejoiced the
end of the war, bloggers, activists and journalists on the ground, as well as
ordinary Gazans, opted for mourning the dead and wondering what's next.

billion.
