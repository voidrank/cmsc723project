_CNN_ has officially been granted access to Syria and Arwa Damon is tweeting
from Damascus, three months after protests calling for the overthrow of the
Assad regime started. Syria shut its doors to Arab and international media
after the start of the protests and the world has to choose between reports on
social media or statements and coverage from Syrian government officials.

Here are some of Damon's first impressions.

Four hours ago, she
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/arwaCNN/status/83904781558620160):

> CNN has officially been granted access to #syria. am in damascus…off to meet
> govt minder who accompanies us on all shoots

And a few minutes ago, she updated us
[saying](https://twitter.com/#!/arwaCNN/status/83969645111025664):

> we visited the area around old damascus t'day…nearly surreal contrast
> w/images of suffering we've been seeing from other parts of #syria

Damon [says](https://twitter.com/#!/arwaCNN/status/83970174264410113) some
Syrians were angry with what they described as the West meddling in Syria:

> quite a few people angrily approached us saying US & west have no business
> meddling in #syria

She [continues](https://twitter.com/#!/arwaCNN/status/83970547347767296):

> govt says only targeting armed grps & officials ask us why world so focused
> on 10K #syria refugees when US-led iraq war displaced millions?

and [observes](https://twitter.com/#!/arwaCNN/status/83971967832702976):

> its feels as if #syria is 2 countries w/ppl living in 2 different realities.

She [concludes](https://twitter.com/#!/arwaCNN/status/83972601478791168):

> we asked to be taken on friday (tomorrow) to the areas where the demo's
> usually happen…let see if request is granted. #syria

Meanwhile, _Al Jazeera International_ ‘s Rula Amin has been
[tweeting](https://twitter.com/#!/RulaAmin) regularly from Syria since the
beginning of the protests. It seems there are no other ‘official’
international Press tweeting from Damascus at this time.
