The [Answer
Coalition](http://www.answercoalition.org/national/news/april-13-us-drones-
out-of-africa.html#.UWjNoK8fkfQ.twitter) organized a[ march and
rally](http://rt.com/usa/drone-warfare-protest-washington-825/) across the US
to oppose predator drones and extrajudicial killings.

In solidarity they wrote:

> Over 5,000 people have been murdered by U.S. drone strikes in the last few
> years, including a large number of children among the many civilians who
> have been slaughtered by these robotic killing machines…Join us at the White
> House for a march and rally on Saturday, April 13 to let the world know that
> the people of this country are demanding “Drones Out of Africa, the Middle
> East, Asia and Everywhere!”

They tweeted:

Many activists in [Yemen](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/05/14/yemen-the-
nodrones-campaign/) and Pakistan have publicly
[opposed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/04/yemen-us-drone-strike-
kills-civilians/) the use of drones in their countries. Many American
journalists and Middle East experts have also condemned the use of drones. HRW
recently published a [joint letter](http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/12/joint-
letter-president-obama-us-drone-strikes-and-targeted-killings) with human
rights and civil rights groups expressing concern regarding U.S. drone strikes
and targeted killings. It meant a great deal for people in the Middle East to
see and hear average American citizens also voice their rejection.
