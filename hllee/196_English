Since late June 2011, former Prime Minister of Ukraine and one of the [Orange
Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution)‘s leaders, Yulia
Tymoshenko, [has been on
trial](http://www.rferl.org/content/former_ukrainian_prime_minister_goes_on_trial_for_abuse_of_power/24249930.html)
in capital Kyiv for abuse of power.

According to investigators,
[Tymoshenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko) overstepped her
authority when signing a natural gas contract with Russia, as the prices she
negotiated with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were too high for the
Ukrainian economy. If found guilty she [faces up to ten
years](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/04/ukraine-tymoshenko-trial-
idUSLDE7630HU20110704) in prison.

Since the beginning of the trial, netizens inside and outside Ukraine have
actively discussed her case. LEvko of _Foreign Notes_
[found](http://foreignnotes.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-gas-charges-against-
tymoshenko.html) that the charges were impossible to prove:

> So, “Tymoshenko is accused of causing a loss of some $190 million to the
> Ukrainian state because of a 2009 energy deal she signed with Russian Prime
> Minister Vladimir Putin.”
>
> How can anyone be so sure of this figure?
>
> Has Putin or Gazprom ever admitted on the record that they would have sold
> the gas in question for $190 million less to NaftoHaz Ukrainy in the event
> that, in 2009, the Ukrainian side had been represented by anyone else? Not
> very likely…
>
> So to claim anyone else would have got a better deal is pure conjecture..

While, if found guilty, Tymoshenko faces up to 10 years in jail, many are
questioning the fairness of the trial against the leading opposition figure in
the country ahead of the 2012 Parliamentary and 2015 Presidential elections.

The events in the courtroom seemed to do nothing less than reinforce the
impression of a politically-motivated trial. The first day of a pre-trial
hearing took place in a room of no more than 40 square meters, which, at one
time, reportedly held up to a hundred people – conditions that the Head of the
European Commission to Ukraine, Jose Manuel Pinto Teixeira, called
[“inhuman”](http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/24245964.html) [uk]
and Tymoshenko [compared](http://foreignnotes.blogspot.com/2011/06/trial-in-
cattle-truck.html) to a Soviet-time dissident trial.

To make matters worse, on the 6th of July, Judge Kireyev ordered Tymoshenko
and her supporters to be removed from the courtroom for disturbing order. This
is how blogger Taras of _Ukrainiana_ [described](http://tap-the-
talent.blogspot.com/2011/07/tymoshenko-supporters-removed-from.html) the
events:

> A joke of a trial turned into a show of force after the judge stopped

Apparently, after police refused to use force against Members of Parliament
(MPs), the Berkut special forces were called in to push Tymoshenko’s
supporters and journalists out (see [videos](http://tap-the-
talent.blogspot.com/2011/07/tymoshenko-supporters-removed-from.html) here).
Opposition MP Andriy Shevchenko, who was also present in court,
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/ashevch/status/88595810966704128) [uk] about
the special treatment he received by Berkut officers:

> Вивихнули руку, здається. Не звернув увагу зразу

It seems [they have] dislocated my arm. I didn't notice [it] at first

According to Yulia Tymoshenko, her lawyer [was
given](https://twitter.com/#!/YuliaTymoshenko/status/89243193182396416) [uk]
one and a half days to familiarize himself with the case of 5000 pages, which
resulted in him sleeping for 2-3 hours a day for three days in the row, while
also going to the hearings. On the 8 of July he had to be [taken to a
hospital](http://en.ura-inform.com/politics/2011/07/08/court?nocache&nocache).

All of this, however, seems to have only spiked Tymoshenko’s popularity in
both Ukraine and abroad. Alexander Motyl of _Ukraine's Orange Blues_
[explained](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/new/blogs/motyl/The_Serial_Stupidity_of_Trying_Tymoshenko)
it in the following way:

> The very last thing you do with a prominent, influential, charismatic,
> smart, articulate, rich, and photogenic political opponent is put her on
> trial—for anything. Unless, of course, you really do have a smoking gun and
> your evidence is incontrovertible. A bad case against a tough defendant is
> guaranteed to transform Tymoshenko into an international cause célèbre and
> bring down fire and brimstone on the regime—especially in Europe, which
> Yanukovych says he wants to join.

The growth of Tymoshenko’s popularity was also evident on Twitter. She
currently has accumulated 23,501 followers – a number which
[rose](http://watcher.com.ua/2011/02/16/yuliya-tymoshenko-zavela-tviter-i-
vede-pryamu-translyatsiyu-z-henprokuratury/) [uk] sharply from the moment she
launched a personal Twitter account and started a live Twitter feed from the
courtroom. Attention to her account was also accelerated by the judge's
Wednesday [ban](http://updatednews.ca/2011/07/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-
denies-new-accusations/) on live television broadcast from the hearings.

[reiterated](https://twitter.com/#!/Slavik_Krayevsk/status/90100102001201153)
[uk] a popular conclusion in his message to Tymoshenko:

> [@YuliaTymoshenko](http://twitter.com/#!/YuliaTymoshenko): Незвиртайте уваги

Twitter YOU are SUPPORTED by nearly 23500 citizens
