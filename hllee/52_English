TV Rain, Russia's only fully independent TV station, continues the struggle
for existence with the help of its viewers. The [week-long
telethon](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/03/23/a-telethon-to-save-
russias-independent-tv/) [Global Voices report] that started at the end of
March has collected enough funds to maintain broadcasting for just over [53
days](http://tvrain.ru/sos/) [ru].

TV Rain was founded in April, 2010 as an online broadcaster, and hit one
million monthly viewers per month a year later. During the 2012 presidential
election, it attracted even more eyeballs, since it was the only TV station
that gave air-time to opposition leaders. Before it was recently dropped by
90% of Russia's cable providers, its audience reached 17,5 million households.
Since then this number has decreased to 2.5 million.

Since about 70% of TV Rain's revenue came from [TV
advertisement](http://www.sostav.ru/publication/natalya-sindeeva-my-postroim-
novoe-televidenie-8941.html), the drop necessitated a change in the business
model. The management decided to ask viewers for subscription fees and
donations — funding methods used by some western TV and radio stations, like
America's [National Public Broadcasting](http://www.npr.org/about-
npr/178660742/public-radio-finances).

The fundraising effort was supported by RuNet users both in Russia and abroad.
Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted:

> Check out the telethon that TVRain (<http://t.co/EbDEKnLFJG>) is running.
> TVRain is quality , independent journalism that Russia & world need.

Russian poet Andrei Lozhkin [asked ](http://www.proza.ru/2014/03/26/700)[ru]
on a self-publishing website for writers (Proza.ru):

> не лучше ли слышать, хоть иногда, альтернативное мнение? Если мнение будет
> только у государства, то с чем его сравнить будет можно?

> is it not better to hear an alternative opinion, at least sometimes? If only
> the state will have opinions, what could you compare them to?

[According to TV Rain
owner](http://tvrain.ru/blog/blog_aleksandra_vinokurova/skolko_stoit_mesjats_dozhdja-420/)
[ru], Aleksandr Vinokurov, right now the channel needs 20.6 million rubles
(0.5 million dollars) per month to survive. This number is half of what was
initially budgeted for 2014. In comparison, state owned Russia Today spent 933
million rubles (26 million dollars) per month in 2013. Vinokurov said that the
channel is cutting costs where possible — currently the CEO is getting paid
only 14,000 rubles (or $400) per month.

Some of TV Rain's support also comes from Ukranians, who see it as one of few
friendly Russian media resources. According to
[Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tvrain.ru), 68.2% of TV Rain internet
viewers come from Russia and 11% from Ukraine. However, the number of
Ukrainian viewers is growing. Between March 16 and March 29 TV Rain moved from
174th to 132nd spot in Ukraine. The website's rank is also growing in Russia,
moving from 101st to 76th place.

Although right now TV Rain has funds enough for two more months of
broadcasting and its internet reach is increasing, nobody can protect it if
Russia's censorship juggernaut turns in its direction. As the recent
[blockages of opposition websites
show](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/03/13/russia-blocks-four-opposition-
media-portals/) [Global Voices report], the Kremlin can shut down any RuNet
website with impunity.
