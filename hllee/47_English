Russia's War of the Roses. (A spoof of the 1989 film starring Michael Douglas
and Kathleen Turner.) Images mixed by author.

Just outside the Kremlin, there is a public park called [Alexander
Gardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Garden), where you'll find
several monuments to the Soviet Union's victory over fascist Germany,
including a wall with stone slabs dedicated to the 12 “[hero
cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_City)” of the war. Before Russia
annexed Crimea earlier this year, Ukraine was home to three different “hero
cities.” Today, after the loss of Sevastopol, there are only two such cites in
Ukraine: Odessa and Kiev. After last week's deadly fire in Odessa, and months
of tensions between Moscow and Kiev, it's no surprise that the hero-cities
memorial has become an important stage in Russian politics. In the past few
days, two groups have swept through Alexander Gardens with decidedly different
messages.

On May 5, 2014, more than 7 thousand people
[reportedly](http://www.interfax.ru/374947) gathered outside the Kremlin to
show support for Odessa, Kramatorsk, and Slaviansk, observing a minute of
silence for the victims of the Ukrainian government's supposed failures. A
Duma deputy from United Russia, the country's ruling political party, attended
the demonstration, thanking those who came for illustrating Russia's
commitment to Ukrainians’ welfare. People came with flowers, burying Odessa's
slab under roses and candles.

No one, it seems, brought flowers for Kiev. The same day as the demonstration
for Odessa, photographer Evgeny Feldman tweeted an image of Kiev's flowerless
slab in Alexander Gardens. It was the only hero city in the park without
flowers. It seemed that Kiev, the seat of a revolution that recently ousted a
Moscow-friendly government, was no longer considered such a heroic place. With
the Kremlin accusing Kiev of “[criminal
irresponsibility](http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/17AE5C8FB27DD32944257CCC006F507E)”
for allowing scores of people to be burned to death in Odessa, denying the
city its roses was a powerful denunciation.

Not all Muscovites wanted to send this message. Over the next two days, Kiev's
hero-city slab was also covered in flowers. Dozens of people came to the
monument with roses for the neglected city, responding to the previous day's
demonstration with a gesture of their own. Flower-bearers photographed
themselves and tweeted the images, reminding Internet users that there are
still many Russians who aren't willing to rewrite history for the sake of
sticking it to Ukraine's new government.
