Many citizen actions have been organized in the past weeks in Budapest in
protest against the modification of the law that would
[punish](http://avarosmindenkie.blog.hu/2011/11/06/say_no_to_the_imprisonment_of_homeless_people_in_hungary)
“recurrent residing in public places” with an increased fine of €530 or
imprisonment. The law is supposed to come into force by December 1, 2011.

on their blog:

> […] Mate Kocsis, mayor of the 8th district forbade rummaging through garbage

European Federation of National Organisations Working With the Homeless
([FEANTSA](http://www.feantsa.org/code/en/hp.asp)) published [a press
release](http://www.feantsa.org/files/freshstart/Communications/Press%20Releases/2011/hungary_condemnation_joint.pdf)
condemning the regulation passed on November 11:

> […] The drafters of the law argue that imprisoning homeless people is a
> “dissuasive” form of sanction. This is very cynical and ignores the fact
> that homeless people are often obliged to use public space to survive
> because of a lack of services, especially ones adapted to their needs.
> Framing homelessness as an offence subtracts the question of homelessness
> from social policies. It also constitutes a denial of state responsibility
> for what is often a result of structural problems and belies a culture of
> blaming homeless people for their situation. […]

The day after the law passed on November 11, a citizen group called Börtön
helyett lakhatást (Housing, Not Prison) organized a sit-in protest in Máté
Kocsis’ mayor's office. ([The mayor of District
VIII](http://www.parlament.hu/internet/plsql/ogy_kpv.kepv_adat?p_azon=k100&p_vezer=A&p_ckl=39&p_biz=&p_eu=)
is also the advisor of homeless issues to the governing party in Parliament.)

About 30 protesters were arrested by the police and interrogated until late
night. Kettős Mérce [live-

[hu] the events at the office and shared a [photo

of the sit-in.

Index.hu news site's video of the sit-in and the arrests with English
subtitles is [here](http://vimeo.com/32340771).

A week later, a [silent protest was
organized](https://www.facebook.com/events/128773773898565/) [hu] in front of
the Parliament. A photo gallery of Kettős Mérce is
[here](http://magyarinfo.blog.hu/2011/11/19/borton_helyett_lakhatas_tuntetes_kepgaleria).

Börtön helyett lakhatást group called for solidarity with the homeless by
staying on the streets of Budapest on the night when the regulation is coming
into effect ([Night of Solidarity Facebook
event](https://www.facebook.com/events/298459046841194/) [hu]).

KA Steve, an activist known for [hacking the District VIII
regulation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/15/hungary-how-many-
policemen-does-it-take-to-arrest-a-homeless-person/), blogged the following on
[Kettős
Mérce](http://magyarinfo.blog.hu/2011/11/15/a_torvenymodositas_ami_bukni_fog_mert_buknia_kell)
[hu], stating that the modification will fail because citizens finally have to
stand up and say no:

> […] From December 1, 2011, thousands of innocent people may be sent to
> prison. This is not about disputable stances, abstract political questions,
> smaller or bigger shady dealings, ridiculous paintings [referring to the new
> Hungarian constitution which has been illustrated with [paintings ordered by
> the special commissioner of the Prime
> Minister](http://budapost.eu/2011/11/history-paintings-ignite-culture-
> war/)], and it's not even about social justice. It can't be repeated enough
> times: this is about the fact that innocent citizens may be sent to prison.
>
> And this is our responsibility. Years later, our grandchildren will ask what
> we have done, but it's eventually us who will have to account for our
> conscience. And saying “I ‘liked’ the news” or “commented on them” won't be
> a satisfying feeling. […]

Today the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union ([HCLU](http://tasz.hu/en)) started
a [campaign](http://tasz.hu/betegjog/hajlektalansag-kriminalizalasanak-
kronikaja-video) [hu] against the modification of the law, calling on citizens
to write protest letters to the Minister of the Interior and to Máté Kocsis,
the referee of the homeless issues.

The campaign goes with the following video that compares the price of two
nights spent at luxurious Budapest hotels to the price of spending two nights
on a public bench. It should not be evident, but, of course, the latter one is
more expensive.
