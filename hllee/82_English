The countries in South Asia may be thriving economically, but the region must
work together to tackle the problems of poverty, gender inequality and climate
change, according to experts at the recent [South Asia Economic
Summit](http://www.ips.lk/saes2013/) (SAES).

The SAES is an initiative of the premier civil society think-tanks in South
Asia. This year's event was held in Sri Lanka from 2nd to 4th September 2013
hosted by the island's leading economic policy think tank, the Institute of
Policy Studies of Sri Lanka ([IPS](http://www.ips.lk/)). Since 2008, the SAES
is hosted in a [different South Asian country
annually](http://www.ips.lk/saes2013/index.php/saes-history).

This year’s SAES discussed regional issues like harnessing human capital,
managing water, food security and climate change, and sought for more regional
cooperation. [One hundred and twenty

socio-economic experts
[gathered](http://www.dailymirror.lk/business/other/34734-south-asia-economic-
summit-kicks-off-today-.html) in Colombo for the summit, whose theme was
“Towards a Stronger, Dynamic and Inclusive South Asia”, to debate and discuss
over the course of the three days.

An important feature of this event was the active debates on the conference
theme by participants and followers in social media. [The conference
blog](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/) was very active as well
as the Facebook,

[wrote](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/towards-

and challenges of the participating countries:

> The summit has brought together a wide range of stakeholders from the eight
> [SAARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAARC) countries. The stakeholders
> consist of representatives from key think tanks, academic institutions,
> policy institutes, and international agencies. Perhaps the key highlight of
> this summit is the inclusion of a group of young leaders who will be engaged
> in analysis and dissemination of the key discussions. This is certainly a

> the platform for engagement of young leaders in these cooperation
> initiatives.
>
> The summit is most relevant at a time when there is an urgent need for
> increased synergies among the South Asian countries. A region that is
> thriving and growing at the back drop of its rich culture, traditions,
> economic activities and overall increased growth, faces numerous challenges.
> Arenas such as poverty, gender parity, food security, climate change, and
> various other factors remain to be areas that need to be focused upon in a
> more strategic and sustained manner.

[Abdul Halik Azeez](http://abdulhalik.wordpress.com/), blogger and an youth
delegate from Sri Lanka, [started
with](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/washed-out-
streets-and-a-clean-colombo-welcome/) the changing weather in Colombo and what
it means for the region:

> The unpredictability of monsoons, while mildly inconveniencing the city’s
> cubicle warriors with cumbersome umbrellas, plays havoc in the region’s
> agricultural sector, the rise in sea level threatens low lying islands, the
> melting of ice caps in the Himalayas threatens norms of water flow and while
> Colombo may have been benefited with a welcome bout of cooler weather other
> parts of the region have faced extended spells of debilitating heat.
> Besides, of the sea level rises that stroll along Galle Face could soon turn
> into a wade. All these changes affect millions of lives and threaten the
> already struggling development processes of the region.

Blogger [Aarya Nijat](http://www.aanijat.blogspot.com/), an youth delegate
from Afghanistan,
[mentioned](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/in-south-
asia-any-act-becomes-political-even-silence/) that politics is the game
changer:

> The Afghan-French author of The Patience Stone Atiq Rahimi wrote: “…in Iran
> just as well as in Afghanistan (and perhaps South Asia) words defy tyranny…
> the existential problem isn’t “to be or not to be …” but to say or not to
> say… Thus, any act becomes political. Even silence. Even lies… The problem
> lies in each of us, because our hearts are sealed… So should we still doubt
> the political dimension of literature? I’d say NO, because literature is a
> fight against all political systems. It is the power of words against the
> words of power.”

In a post on the last day of the summit, [Nijat
asked](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/are-we-
discussing-the-real-questions/) “Are We Discussing the Real Questions?”:

> Is the public and private sectors pursue similar interests or goals, if you
> will? What is it that the two share in terms of their sense of purpose, upon
> which a potential partnership can be built? Why don’t we talk about this?

[Nandish
Kenia](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/growing-green-
can-private-sector-bring-the-change/), youth delegate from India, discussed
whether the private sector can bring the change:

> One of the arguments that persists is that why is it wrong to trade if the
> farmer is getting a huge lump sum of money for his small piece of land by an
> industrialist? Is he responsible for moving away from green revolution?

[Trisha Rana](http://southasiaeconomicsummit.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/how-do-
we-make-a-south-asia/), youth delegate from Nepal, commented that the [South
Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAARC) (SAARC), an organization of
South Asian nations established in 1985 for the promotion of economic and
social progress, cultural development, friendship and cooperation within the
South Asia region, has failed to make an impact among the South Asian
countries:

> How can we move ahead with a coming together of South Asian hearts, even as
> we have failed to merge our practical, finance heads?
