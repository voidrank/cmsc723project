The photograph below, of a soldier stepping on a little girl, has been
circulating on the social web for the past few days, claimed to be of an IDF
soldier and a Palestinian girl. [Wesley
Muhammad](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=741979104) who posted it
[claimed](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=318367644867196&id=741979104)
to have seen it on someone else's news feed with that caption, and wonders why
it went viral from his page. Within two days the photo (now discarded)
received over 500 comments, including some claims the photo is fake.

highlighting the main claims that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) doesn't
carry that kind of weapon and has no such uniforms, and that photo circulated
mainly among Israelis. Apparently, [the photo was
tweeted](http://www.twitpic.com/5bmza0) last year in French, claiming this is
actually from Syria's demonstrations and asking for it to spread. However,
Arab blogger [Omar Dakhane](http://dakhane.wordpress.com/) found the [original
photo](http://dakhane.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/fake.png) (below), which is
neither from Syria nor Israel but a street theater performance in Bahrain.

This story could have ended here with a lesson not to believe everything that
circulates out there in the age of media manipulation and virality, but
apparently some Israelis have decided **the best response to a viral lie is a
humorous meme.** In the last 24 hours many photos replacing the soldier with
different characters have been circulating on Facebook, initiated by
[10Gag](http://www.10gag.co.il/), the Israeli answer to
[9Gag](http://9gag.com/) humor and memes generator.

For example, a photo where the soldier was [replaced by a dog wearing real IDF
uniform](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150574470047010&set=p.10150574470047010&type=1),
probably also responding humorously to earlier allegations that IDF trains
dogs to attack Palestinians. Other entities stepping on that girl included an
[empire soldier ](http://www.10gag.co.il/gag/1147)from _Star Wars_ , the
[Angry Birds](http://www.10gag.co.il/gag/1198), the
[Android](http://www.10gag.co.il/gag/1151), the _Avatar_
[N'aavi](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150748561263135&set=a.170201663134.154748.603583134&type=1&theater),

and more.

By turning the photo into a meme, Israelis are saying in “social media
language” that such a situation is ridiculous and fictional, although Wesley
Muhammad who started the viral spread
[concludes](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=318367644867196&id=741979104):
“I took the photo down (even though that type of thing DOES happen in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict)”. In response, _Shani Yaakov_ posted a collage
of pictures titled “[this is the true picture of the
IDF](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2857000378791&set=a.2856998698749.2134970.1073046002&type=1)”
(below) in which soldiers are seen in positive and friendly interactions with
Palestinians. As for the truth, as always, it's probably somewhere in the
middle.
