A state of national calamity was
[declared](http://www.gov.ph/2013/11/11/english-statement-of-president-aquino-
on-typhoon-yolanda-november-11-2013/) by the Philippine president after super
typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) left a trail of destruction in several major islands
of the Visayas region. Entire communities were [wiped
out](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/10/photos-cries-for-help-as-super-
typhoon-haiyan-devastates-central-philippines/) after a tsunami-like storm
surge hit the provinces of Leyte and Samar. More than 10,000 are feared dead

Roads were impassable for many days and power lines are still down. The
situation in remote towns is now being revealed through the reports of
journalists and rescuers. The photos from these reports reveal more stories of
devastation and suffering.

Reporter David Yu Santos
[documented](http://www.solarnews.ph/news/2013/11/11/guiuan-or-bust-for-solar-
news-team1#.UoERJ_mmivR) the situation in Guiuan, Eastern Samar, the first
town ravaged by typhoon Haiyan. Below are some of the photos on his Facebook

Lieutenant Colonel Fermin Carangan of the Philippine military
[recounted](http://cbholganzablog.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/a-survivors-story/)
his ordeal during the storm surge:

> …we noticed that water was slowly entering our office, so we went out again.
> Then suddenly, we saw that the water was getting higher and higher, until we
> were forced to get up the ceilings of the building. We had to bore holes on
> the ceiling just to get up there, and I was the last one up.
>
> Suddenly the building collapsed and I saw my men falling into the surging
> water and very strong winds. There was also no more roof on top of the
> building. I was able to hold on to a piece of wood – a truss which I
> forcibly removed just before I was taken by waves and the strong current.
>
> At sea, we went through another hell. We were slapped by waves, great big
> waves from all directions. We were also toyed by swirling winds. And we
> couldn’t help but drink a lot of salt water

Many volunteered in telethons to raise donations for the victims. Phillip
Willard Medalla described his
[volunteering](https://www.facebook.com/phillipwillard/posts/10200664067513553)
experience:

> I spoke with hundreds of callers. In most instances, I caught myself teary-
> eyed while smiling with an excited but shaking voice because of stories of
> tragedy and hopelessness, and expressed willingness to donate and help as
> well. Reality is, there have been lots of donations but there are far more
> victims who need HELP.

Yeb Sano, lead negotiator of the government of the Philippines in the UN
Climate Summit in Poland, [delivered](http://aliran.com/15521.html) an
impassioned speech in pushing for the signing of a climate pact. He made
reference to the typhoon disaster that hit the country:

> We must stop calling events like these as natural disasters. It is not
> natural when people continue to struggle to eradicate poverty and pursue
> development and gets battered by the onslaught of a monster storm now
> considered as the strongest storm ever to hit land. It is not natural when
> science already tells us that global warming will induce more intense
> storms. It is not natural when the human species has already profoundly
> changed the climate.
