In the latest attack against Pakistan's Hazara Shia minority, a bomb ripped
through a busy market in the southwestern city of Quetta in Pakistan on
February 16, [claiming as many as 63
lives](http://tribune.com.pk/story/508261/blast-on-kirani-road-in-quetta/) and
injuring at least 180 others, including many women and children.

The bombing occurred in Hazara Town, a territory home to the [Hazara community
of Shia
Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazara_people#Hazaras_in_Pakistan), who
were also the target of an [attack last month that left 96 people
dead.](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/2013117124512947691.html)
In that incident, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a billiard
parlor, killing several people. Shortly afterward, as people rushed to help
the victims, a car bomb outside the parlor went off.

The banned militant organization, [Lashkar-e-Jhangvi
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Jhangvi)(LeJ), which allegedly has
[ties to Pakistan's intelligence
agency](http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2013%5C02%5C16%5Cstory_16-2-2013_pg3_4),
has [claimed ](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/16/uk-pakistan-violence-
shiites-idUKBRE91F02O20130216)responsibility for [the
bombings](http://www.hazara.net/downloads/pakistan/lej-
statement_alamdar_road_blast_jan102013.html).

As the sectarian violence against Pakistan's Hazaras continue unabated, many
across the country have accused the government of deadly inaction, demanding
that authorities move off the sidelines and step in to halt the mass killings.

[Ali Dayan Hasan](https://twitter.com/AliDayan), the Human Rights Watch
director for Pakistan, [criticized the government's
absence](https://twitter.com/AliDayan/status/302805387407667200) on Twitter:

Human Rights Watch [noted](http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/01/pakistan-abuses-
impunity-erode-rights) in its [World Report 2013](http://www.hrw.org/world-
report/2013) that the LeJ has ties to the Pakistani Inter-Services
Intelligence (ISI) and other intelligence services, writing that “Pakistan’s
government has failed to act against abuses by the security and intelligence
agencies, which continued to allow extremist groups to attack religious
minorities.” Hasan also
[asked](https://twitter.com/AliDayan/status/302800760658358272):

[Arif Hussain Hazara](https://twitter.com/Arif_Hazara) warned that inaction
would have tragic consequences:

Similarly, columnist [Mehr Tarar](https://twitter.com/MehrTarar) accused the
ruling party, [Pakistan People's
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party) (PPP), of doing
nothing to protect the Hazaras:

[Haider Changezi](https://twitter.com/Aushpaz), a Hazara Twitterati, suggested
on the same day as the market bombing that Pakistani Twitter users unite
against the violence under the hashtag
[#ActionAgainstLeJ](https://twitter.com/search/%23ActionAgainstLeJ):

> @Aushpaz: Dear [#Pakistan](https://twitter.com/search/%23Pakistan) – can we

Following the attack on Hazara Shias in early January, thousands of Pakistani
protesters attended a four-day vigil,
[demanding](http://dawn.com/2013/01/13/rallies-against-target-killings-in-
quetta/) an “operation cleanup in
[Balochistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan) against
serial killings of Hazara people.” They also called for the removal of
provincial government officials and a handover of the city to the army.
Although the army has not yet been called in, a [state of emergency was
declared](http://tribune.com.pk/story/493704/balochistan-emergency-governors-
rule-imposed/) in the province.

Imran Ali of the BBC [noted](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21485731)
that the government has yet to arrest those responsible for the bombings:

> After the last bomb attack in Quetta, and the ensuing protests by the Hazara
> community, the Pakistan government sacked Baluchistan's chief minister,
> Nawab Aslam Raisani, but has yet to arrest the culprits behind the attack.
> This came as no surprise to the Hazara community, who have yet to see the
> Pakistan government take action against the Sunni extremist group Lashkar-e-
> Jhangvi.

[Yousuf Nazar](https://twitter.com/YousufNazar), a Pakistani author, [wrote
](https://twitter.com/YousufNazar/status/302814162172649473)that joint action
by security forces would be the only way to put an end to the violence:

> [@YousufNazar](https://twitter.com/YousufNazar/status/302814162172649473): A
> joint army/commando/police operation against TTP/LeJ is the only solution.
> They don't even spare women & children; U can't talk to animals

[Aziz Ali](https://twitter.com/azizhazara), a Hazara Twitter user,
[asked](https://twitter.com/azizhazara/status/302877535354617856) why the
government hasn't moved against the authors of the killings:

> [@azizhazara](https://twitter.com/azizhazara/status/302877535354617856): Why
> no one come forward from government and announce targetted action [against]
