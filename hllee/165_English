Three of the four teams remaining in the 2012 Cup of Nations at the time of
writing [Tuesday 7 February, 2012] are from West Africa: Côte d'Ivoire, Mali
and Ghana are set to play in the tournament semi-finals on Wednesday 8, 2012.
Games will be played in Bata, Equatorial Guinea (Ghana) and at Libreville,
Gabon (Mali vs Côte d'Ivoire). They are joined by Zambia, participating in
their first semi-finals for [16
years](http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1579145.html?cid=twitter_voiceofthesite).

The 3-0 quarter-final victory of Zambia against Sudan revived the hopes of
supporters. A goal from defender Stopilla Sunzu in the fifteenth minute,
followed by a second after 66 minutes from Captain Chris Katongo and another
four minutes from the end by James Chamanga, clinched Zambia's first semi-
final place since 1996.

Meanwhile, the Elephants of Côte d'Ivoire secured their seventh semi-final

The Eagles of Mali [overcame](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16889291)
the Panthers of Gabon with a 5-4 penalty shootout victory following a full
time 1-1 draw:

The Black Stars of Ghana confirmed their place in the semis with goals from
John Mensah and André Ayew giving a 2-1 victory over Tunisia. Tunisia held the
score at 1-1 until injury time before bowing out after a 101st minute blunder
from their goalkeeper, Aymen Mathlouthi, gave Ghana their second goal.

There is a great atmosphere of celebration and interest surrounding this
tournament. From Mali to Zambia, fans have shared their excitement as well as
their predictions regarding the 28th Africa Cup of Nations Final, scheduled to
take place on Sunday 12 February, in Stade de l'Amitié, Libreville, Gabon.

[Swithin Swaray](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=663490015) went
further on Facebook, giving his opinion of some weak points of the Ghana team:

Ghana and Mali each got the better of their respective opponents after long
matches of more than 120 minutes. Will they have the necessary energy and
stamina to face Zambia and the Côte d'Ivoire?

The semi-finals of Wednesday 8 February will reveal the answer.
