2011 will go down in Nigeria's history as the year of [the nation's third
presidential election](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/nigeria-
elections-2011/) since independence. For the first half of the year, the
blogosphere was abuzz with discussion of the election: protests, campaigns,
[debates](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/19/nigeria-ruckus-over-
presidential-debate/), [the role of
technology](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/07/nigeria-will-technology-
impact-2011-elections/), preparations for the polls, [election day
itself](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/17/nigeria-votes-2011-opinions-
from-the-polls/).

In the wake of the election, violence erupted in Northern Nigeria, marring
hopes for a new era. Despite small victories in the political and cultural
landscapes, the latter part of the year was overshadowed by sectarian violence
in the northern part of the country.

**A historic election**

Nigeria has a tradition of rotating the presidency between candidates from the
Muslim-majority North and Christian-majority South. [This arrangement was
upset](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/02/12/nigeria-after-two-leaderless-
months-a-new-acting-president/) when former President Umaru Yar'Adua died in
office in 2010, leaving his second-in-command, southerner Goodluck Jonathan to
fill the position.

Jonathan's subsequent presidential run in 2011 angered many northerners, who
felt the north had been cheated out its turn in power.

The election was widely hailed as being “free and fair” despite some minor
irregularities and fraud. Nigerians celebrated this unprecedented success
across the country and the diaspora. Kunle Durojaiye [summed
up](http://nigerianstalk.org/2011/04/10/nigeria-is-the-stage-set/) the general
sentiment:

> One cannot deny that there is a sense of a wind of change. People voted, and
> waited behind to witness the counting and collation of votes; media stations
> ran a live coverage of the elections while it lasted, and very importantly,
> young people influenced the exercise with the flood of information available
> via twitter, facebook and blackberry messaging. Without mincing words,
> change is inevitable, but one just wonders if the stage is truly set.

**Sectarian violence**

However the success of the election appeared a small victory in light of the
violence that followed. North-South tensions regarding the election came on
top of an already charged situation in Northern Nigeria, where violent attacks
and bombings have gained momentum since police forces clashed with Islamist
sect [Boko Haram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram) in 2009.

Soon after Jonathan's victory, violence again erupted in the North, with a
series of bombings [in Abuja and
elsewhere](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/06/19/nigeria-on-an-explosive-
projectile/) claimed by Boko Haram. As the year wore on, the intensity of the
violence increased, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands to leave their
homes.

[@jongambrellAP](http://twitter.com/jongambrellAP/) described the situation:

**Small victories**

In spite of the violence, the latter part of the year also brought positive
developments. Many Nigerians were excited about the appointment of Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala, former managing director of the World Bank, as Nigeria's new
finance minister.

In a post titled, _Nigeria: Adrift, Awaiting the Arrival of a Woman_ ,
Nwachukwu Egbunike [sampled
responses](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/13/nigeria-adrift-awaiting-
the-arrival-of-a-woman/) to Okonjo-Iweala's appointment, including this one
from [Nmachi
Jidenma](http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/Home/5727926-146/story.csp):

> For corrupt and undisciplined government officials: ‘wahala dey’. It looks
> like ‘the trouble woman’ is back in town! This is of course good news for
> Nigerians and most of us would be happy to have her back.

In another post, Egbunike [pointed
to](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/12/nigeria-saharareporters-africas-
wikileaks/) [Sahara Reporters](http://saharareporters.com/), dubbed “Nigeria's
Wikileaks”, as a bastion of free expression in a troubled landscape for press
freedom.

The [419 Positive Project](http://www.419positive.org/419-reasons-to-like-
nigeria-complete-list/) collected developments like these and challenged
people to say something positive about Nigeria in hopes of changing the
country's negative image.

[@gbengasesan](http://twitter.com/#%21/gbengasesan "'Gbenga Sesan") wrote of
the project:
