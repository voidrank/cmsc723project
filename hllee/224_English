People celebrate and record the moment of celebration at Liberation Square

Citizen recorded videos have started cropping up showing the historical moment
when Mubarak resigned to the Presidency of Egypt and how the people at Tahir
Square reacted to the news.

First [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQv2uaIrPz4) shared by
YouTube's Citizen Tube [through Twitter.
](http://twitter.com/#!/citizentube/status/36197593537056768) In it, people at
prayer hold off the celebration until it is finished, and that's when they
break into chants and cheers.

The next video comes from
[3Arabawy](http://www.arabawy.org/2011/02/12/tahrir-26/) blog and also shows
the celebration at the Libertion Square. From the front of a TV set in a
storefront where the news comes in, to the jumping and hugging crowds in the
square, where people waved flags, danced, embraced and cried :

At the barricades [in front of the presidential
palace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-iyA2XGmIE), the news was also
celebrated. The person behind the camera seemed to get excited and changed the
direction of the camera mid way, so you may have to tilt your head to one side
to see it all:

If the number of lit screens from people holding up mobile devices are a sign,
we will be seeing more of these celebratory videos crop up on the web pretty
soon.
