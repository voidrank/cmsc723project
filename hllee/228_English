With a few more hours to go until the Million Man March, another Day of Rage
will dawn upon Egypt as it enters its eighth day of massive protests against
the Mubarak regime tomorrow.

Spirits are high and Egyptians are all fired up for the day ahead, as the
government continues to clampdown on whatever was left of the Internet, after
Egypt [turned the switch off](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/28/egypt-
an-internet-blackhole/) on January 27. The plan is to march from Tahrir
Square, starting at 9am Cairo time, up to Mubarak's presidential palace in
Heliopolis, asking him to step down.

The government is meanwhile bracing itself for the day, and has blocked access
to Egypt's [last remaining
ISP](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/31/last-isp-goes-offline-fears-of-
losing-mobile-networks/), to stop the world from hearing the voices of
Egyptians on the ground. This comes after further harassment to mainstream
media, particularly Al Jazeera, which had six of its journalists arrested
today and their equipment, cameras and phones confiscated. They have since
been released.

Al Jazeera's coverage of the demonstrations, which started on January 25, has
been a constant nuisance to the Mubarak regime, [which has not yet been
successful](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/30/egypt-al-jazeera-cairo-
bureau-shut/) in taking it off the air.

People from around the world have been glued to their television screens, and
online streams of Al Jazeera, to keep abreast of developments on the ground in
Egypt, particularly after the Internet was shut down. The Doha-based network
was at the forefront of coverage, with many netizens dedicated to transcribing
and tweeting its coverage, around the clock.

The government also stopped train connections to Cairo today, to prevent
people from other areas from joining the march. Reports also continue to
trickle in that mobile phone lines will be shut tomorrow, just like it
happened when the protests first started last week.

Here are reactions from Twitter on the Million Man March, which is seeing a
lot of solidarity and support from around the world. The global community
continues to watch, cheer and pray for Egyptian protesters as they continue
with their demands for political and economic reforms, in a country ruled by
Mubarak, 83, for 30 years.
