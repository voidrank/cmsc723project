Wherever the World Cup has traveled in Latin America, various kinds of social
unrest has followed. This article is the second installment in a series that
studies at the [relationship](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/06/world-
cups-latin-america-football-protests-unrest/) between the world's largest
football contest and political turmoil. You can read the [first part

football-protests-unrest/).

**Mexico 1986**  
The blog [El
Universal](http://blogs.eluniversal.com.mx/wweblogs_detalle.php?p_fecha=2009-11-13&p_id_blog=76&p_id_tema=9214)
looks at how crowds[ heckled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFzzzhv4L5g) the
country's then-president, [Miguel de la
Madrid,](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_la_Madrid) during the opening
ceremony of the [1986](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_1986) World Cup.
More than 90,000 spectators shouted over the president's speech, infuriated
that the country went ahead with hosting the games, just eight months after a
major [earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Mexico_City_earthquake)
hit Mexico City on September 19, 1985.

Mexico took responsibility for organizing the 1986 World Cup after Colombia
lost the opportunity to host in 1982, after FIFA determined that Columbia did
not meet the tournament's host requirements. At the time, Rafael Castillo,
then president of the Mexican Futbol Federation, argued that the country's
stadiums “only need a bucket of paint and a brush” and they'd be ready for
fans and players, as the infrastructure was only 16-years-old (built for
Mexico's 1970 World Cup).

**Chile 1962**  
In 1956, FIFA held a summit to determine the 1962 World Cup's host country. In
a brilliant speech, Chile's sports director, Carlos Dittborn, won his country
the honor. “Because we have nothing, Dittborn promised, “we want to do
everything.”

Just as in Mexico more than 20 years later, however, a devastating
[earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Valdivia_earthquake) hit Chile
two years before its World Cup. Italian journalists Antonio Ghirelli and
Corrado Pizzinibelli, writing for the newspaper “[Il Resti del
Carlino](http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=1833631&s=futbol/mundiales&type=story),”
said of Chile's travails:

> [Chile] es el símbolo triste de uno de los países subdesarrollados del mundo
> y afligido por todos los males posibles: desnutrición, prostitución,
> analfabetismo, alcoholismo, miseria… Bajo estos aspectos Chile es terrible y
> Santiago su más doliente expresión, tan doliente que pierde en ello sus
> características de ciudad anónima.

> [Chile] is a sad example of one of the world's underdeveloped countries
> afflicted by everything that can go wrong: malnutrition, prostitution,
> illiteracy, alcoholism, misery… Considering these aspects, Chile is in a
> terrible state and Santiago is suffering the most of all, so much that it
> lost it's the characteristics of a city.

Ghirelli and Pizzinibelli left Chile before the World Cup even began, fearing
for their own safety. Indeed, a few days before the opening match, an
Argentinian journalist, mistaken for an Italian, was beaten up in a bar in
Santiago.

**Uruguay 1930**  
History's first World Cup took place in an era with no shortage of political
and social trauma. In 1930, the tournament was sent to Uruguay, to take the
game far away from Europe, which was still dealing with the fallout of World
War I. When the U.S. stock market crashed in 1929, European countries suddenly
worried that transportation costs might make it too expensive to send their
teams to the Western Hemisphere. The World Cup's
“[story](http://yucatan.com.mx/deportes/mundial-brasil-2014/en-
uruguay-1930-comenzo-la-historia-de-la-copa-del-mundo)” began then, when
Uruguay offer to pay the transportation fees of participating teams.

The blog [del29alneobatillismo](http://del29alneobatllismo.blogspot.com/)
argues that Uruguay's organization of the soccer championship destabilized the
country's social environment by declining commercial activity and leading to
currency devaluation, unemployment, and a drop in wages. These World-Cup-
created problems exacerbated an internal political crisis, precipitating a
[coup d'état](http://escuela536b.blogspot.com/2011/10/rupturas-
institucionales-en-nuestro.html) three years after the tournament.

Given the high economic demands placed on World Cup host countries, Latin
America has not always been the most suitable place to hold the event. Of
course, for all their social unrest, the Latin American people have been some
of the World Cup's most hospitable hosts. True fans of football, it is the
allocation of scare resources to a nonessential game that disturbs the public.

FIFA, for its part, recently determined that countries with large disruptive
social movements and high levels of inequality should not host the tournament.
Sports journalist Francisco Sagredo
([@panchosagredo](https://twitter.com/panchosagredo)) reiterated this in the
magazine article in Qué pasa:

> Tras [#Brasil2014](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brasil2014?src=hash), la FIFA
> evitará países con movimientos sociales y altos niveles de desigualdad. Por

> After [#Brasil2014](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brasil2014?src=hash), Fifa
> will avoid countries experiencing various social movements and high levels
> of inequality.

This spurred questions and reactions on Twitter. From La Serena, in northern
Chile, Roberto Peralta tweeted:

> [@panchosagredo](https://twitter.com/panchosagredo) / Entonces no habrá más

Típico Chileno argued that countries without social movements don't even
exist.

Even so, according to Sagredo, FIFA believes that Russia and Qatar, the Cup's
next two hosts, do not present any serious problems. Whatever one thinks about
the modern state of social movements and inequality, however, everyone can
benefit from studying the long history of hosting the World Cup in struggling
societies battling troubling times. The lessons of Latin America are a good
place to begin.
