North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats against South
Korea and its allies. The North's latest aggression, however, has been as
intense as ever and tensions in East Asia region have escalated dangerously
fast over the past few weeks.

After the North [nullified the armistice
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/06/south-koreans-dub-north-koreas-
armistice-threat-a-daring-aid-ploy/)with the South Korea in early March 2013,
the U.S.-South Korea executed joint military drills as a show of force. On
March 28, the U.S.’s B-2 [stealth bombers flew

and North's leader Kim Jong-un, taking this as the last straw and ordered
[missiles on standby](http://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-puts-

korea/story?id=18846180#.UVnUiKtNZ9Q)that the North is in a “state of war”
with South Korea and vowed to shut down the Kaesong industrial complex, a
joint venture between the two Koreas. On March 31, the United States [sent
F-22 stealth fighter jets](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/31/korea-
north-usa-f-idUSL2N0CN0BT20130331) to South Korea for another military drill.

Even to South Koreans who have been overexposed to all kinds of hostile
signals coming from the North, current developments were frightening indeed.
And some net users tried to calm themselves by bringing up the old saying of
‘[Barking Dog Never
Bites](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/barking_dogs_seldom_bite)’–which has
become one of the most used metaphors in the Twitterverse and Blogsphere.
However, how net users employed this clause, varied.

But of course, there were some usual uninterested net users who have had so
much disturbing news about North Korea that they grew numb to it. A tweet
below shows how South Koreans take this news, comparing it to how Japanese
citizens who are living in a country so prone to earthquakes, respond to news
about earthquakes.

When Gaesung Industrial complex, which provides the North access to $2 billion
in trade a year, is closed, local reports predict it will [affect livelihood

The tensions and conflicts have increased so far with no sign of alleviation,
and some predictions claim Kim Jong-un may actually pull the trigger just[
](https://twitter.com/wikitree/status/318482770299072512)[not to lose
face](http://i.wik.im/112263 ) [ko]. More than a few net users voiced concern
that responding to hostility with more hostility may not be a wise move,
considering what South Korea could lose in case of a real war.
