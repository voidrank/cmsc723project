[Emoya ](http://www.emoya.co.za/)Private Game Reserve, Conference Centre and
Spa in Bloemfontein, South Africa has created a fake slum for wealthy tourists
to experience slum life “within the safe environment of a private game
reserve.” The introduction to the fake slum [reads](
http://www.emoya.co.za/p23/accommodation/shanty-town-for-a-unique-
accommodation-experience-in-bloemfontein.html):

> Millions of people are living in informal settlements across South Africa.
> These settlements consist of thousands of houses also referred to as Shacks,
> Shantys or Makhukhus. A Shanty usually consists of old corrugated iron
> sheets or any other waterproof material which is constructed in such a way
> to form a small “house” or shelter where they make a normal living. A
> paraffin lamp, candles, a battery operated radio, an outside toilet (also
> referred to as a long drop) and a drum where they make fire for cooking is
> normally part of this lifestyle.
>
> Now you can experience staying in a Shanty within the safe environment of a
> private game reserve. This is the only Shanty Town in the world equipped
> with under-floor heating and wireless internet access!

Below is a video of the mock shanty town posted on YouTube by Emoya:  

Most people online have described the idea as tasteless and disgraceful. Siji
Jabbar, writing on This Is Africa,
[said](http://www.thisisafrica.me/opinion/detail/20063/fake-slum-for-wealthy-
tourists-the-most-tasteless-and-offensive-tourism-idea-ever):

> If you thought the idea of rich tourists on holiday taking time out for a
> walking (or riding) tour through a slum in order to stare at slum
> inhabitants like they’re animals at a safari was tasteless, insensitive and
> offensive, the people at Emoya Luxury Hotel & Spa in Bloemfontein, South
> Africa, have found a way to offer something even more tasteless.
>
> In case you haven’t heard, the Emoya people have built a fake shanty town
> consisting of “shacks” so that guests can experience what it’s like to stay
> in a shanty town. For R850 (€60; $82) – about half the average monthly
> salary in South Africa – you and three friends, family members or colleagues
> can spend a night in a shack made of corrugated iron sheets. They “shanty
> town” has room for 52 guests. I kid you not.

Siji [explained](http://www.thisisafrica.me/opinion/detail/20063/fake-slum-
for-wealthy-tourists-the-most-tasteless-and-offensive-tourism-idea-ever) why
the idea is offensive:

> There are one billion people worldwide living in slums, and I'll hazard a
> guess that not one of this billion would continue to do so if they had a
> choice. Choice is the reason why the idea of “experiencing” what it is like
> is complete nonsense.
>
> If you have to live in a shack built from cardboard and corrugated metal
> sheets, you are, relatively speaking, poor, and poverty is about not having
> choices. by accident of birth, you find yourself growing up and living in a
> shack in a shanty town. It’s not a moral failing, though some people appear
> to see it as such, but to the person living in a shack it can feel like
> failure, mainly because that’s the message society transmits. […] It’s about
> fighting every day to hang on to your dignity, while others, knowingly or
> inadvertently, try to strip you of it. It’s about constant worry: will you
> have enough to eat tomorrow? Next week? Can you afford to get ill, and what
> happens if you do? Will your shack be demolished tomorrow morning because it
> was built “illegally’, rendering you homeless? You can’t experience any of
> that unless you actually are poor, and you can’t walk away from poverty, or
> from your shack, overnight or in a week or when you've had enough of the
> “experience”. So all any guest in one of these “shack” will experience is a
> night or more of camping.

Commenting on Siji's post, Kathy Smedley [considered the
idea](http://www.thisisafrica.me/opinion/detail/20063/fake-slum-for-wealthy-
tourists-the-most-tasteless-and-offensive-tourism-idea-
ever#comment-1133105323) to be simply stupid:

> This is just plain stupid!!! What in the world is wrong with the genius that
> came up with such a lame brained idea. Do they not know this is making fun
> of people who by no choice of their own live like this? Very tasteless idea,
> right along with the idiots who would actually PAY to stay in something such
> as this place. If someone wants to pay to stay in a shanty, let them stay in
> a real one, and then maybe they just might take their money and put it to
> good use, such as donating to a charity or homeless shelter that could use
> the dollars to help those less fortunate

Another reader, Kenyan slum dweller, [pointed

wealthy-tourists-the-most-tasteless-and-offensive-tourism-idea-
ever#comment-1135586462) the idea was awesome:

[ONE](http://www.one.org), a movement of people around the world fighting the
absurdity of extreme poverty, posted an article about the fake slum on its
Facebook page and asked, [“What do you think of
this?”](https://www.facebook.com/ONE/posts/10151837375049472)

Answering the question, Selina Dawn Kyle [thought
that](https://www.facebook.com/ONE/posts/10151837375049472?comment_id=27944260&offset=0&total_comments=165)
the idea may help psychologically:

> actually….. if done right… it may psychologically help… the sad truth is

> until they have stepped into their shoes… so LET THEM step into their

The idea would be brilliant, [observed](

Sue Henderson, if it was for educational purposes:

> If it was being used to educate people then yes, it would be brilliant, but
> they're going to have heating, a proper bathroom and so on, so no. As the

> I've long since got beyond being surprised at the arrogance and

Jan Zee [advised](

> These wealthy tourists need to live in a real slum, with a real family, for
