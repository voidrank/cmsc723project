Each year, approximately [one million tourists
visit](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/maldives/tourist-arrivals) the island
nation Maldives for its sunny warm weather and stunning natural beauty.

But there's an ugly consequence of all those visitors, along with the
Maldives’ own 395,000 residents: the combined trash accumulated is a headache
for the small country.

To deal with the problem, the government decided in December 1991 to use a
separate island as the final destination for the huge amount of waste produced
by the tourism industry.
[Thilafushi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi), nicknamed ‘Rubbish
Island’, originally was a lagoon called ‘Thilafalhu’ with a length of 7
kilometres and a width of 200 metres at the shallowest regions. Huge pits were
dug, and waste was deposited into the middle of the pit, which was topped off
with a layer of construction debris and then uniformly levelled with white
sand.

An average of [330 tonnes of
rubbish](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2162653/Maldives-
island-paradise-Thilafushi-trashed-reduced-pile-rubbish.html) are brought to
Thilafushi every day, most of which are from Malé. At one point, more than
31,000 truckloads of garbage were being transported to Thilafushi annually.
Open-air burning of garbage is also practiced here.

Today, Thilafushi has a landmass of more than 0.43 km2, which is leased to
industrial activities such as boat manufacturing, cement packing, methane gas
bottling and various large-scale warehousing.

The blog of environmental organisation Bluepeace
[wrote](http://www.bluepeacemaldives.org/blog/hazardous-waste/thilafushi-
toxic-bomb-in-the-ocean) that used batteries, asbestos, lead and other
potentially hazardous waste mixed with the municipal solid wastes in
Thilafushi island are seeping into the water and creating serious ecological
and health problems in the Maldives. However, the concerns have never
materialized into a campaign by local activists.

Mordy at collaborative travel project [Atlas
Obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thilasfushi-the-rubbish-island)
described the problem:

> Commercial activity along with indiscriminate dumping has brought an
> abundance of toxic materials to the lagoon – broken oil drums, asbestos,
> lead, and other noxious metals mix in with daily household garbage items
> creating a noxious sludge. There is little around the island that goes
> unpolluted as harmful substances seep into the water and smoke from burning
> waste floods the air.

Filmmaker Alison Teal has made a documentary about her time in the Maldives as
a part of her online film series [Alison's
Adventures](http://alisonsadventures.com). Some remarkable photos of Alison’s
trip to the garbage island can be [found
here](http://asiancorrespondent.com/127550/thilafushi-an-island-of-trash-in-
the-
maldives/?utm_source=feedly&utm_reader=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=thilafushi-
an-island-of-trash-in-the-maldives).

The government [temporarily banned](http://www.haveeru.com.mv/video/398)
rubbish dumping on the island in December 2011 after a [surge in waste
floating](http://minivannews.com/environment/thilafushi-closed-for-clean-up-
as-garbage-island-overflows-29101) in the island's lagoon and drifting out to
sea. But still now all the garbage from Malé ends up there.

[Alibeyya](http://minivannews.com/environment/thilafushi-closed-for-clean-up-
as-garbage-island-overflows-29101), a commenter on an article on local news
site Minivan, pointed to the crux of the problem:

> The delicate environment of Maldives is in need of a responsible waste
> management system. It is a big challenge given the geographical situation
> where each island including resorts must manage its own waste. [..] The
> resorts should be able to contain to get rid of their waste without having
> to dump to Thialfushi lagoon.

In early 2013 there [were reports](http://minivannews.com/politics/maldives-
waste-management-hampered-by-local-politics-lack-of-funding-51680) that
Maldives’ waste management is being hampered by local politics and lack of
funding. Amidst local reports of illegal dumping of wastes in Thilafushi,
there was [huge confusion over](http://minivannews.com/politics/state-private-
sector-divided-over-responsibility-for-maldives-garbage-dumping-56243) the
responsibility for the management of garbage dumping. The Thilafushi
management was transferred to the Malé City Council (MCC) in 2010 and a
[contract was signed in 2011](http://minivannews.com/politics/no-waste-spill-
in-thilafushi-lagoon-male-city-council-60469) with the Indian-based company
Tatva Global Renewable Energy to rehabilitate the island and manage the
garbage problem.

But the deal never was implemented due to bureaucracy and political
interference and [recently it was
cancelled](http://minivannews.com/politics/government-terminates-tatva-waste-
management-deal-90580), making the future of Thilafushi uncertain.

[Abdullah Faraz](http://minivannews.com/society/comment-anatomy-of-a-
manufactured-crisis-54762) writes in an opinion piece in Minivan News:

> The first point to note is that underneath all the political rhetoric and
> maneuvering lies a real issue that affects many lives – the public health
> hazard, teachers and students being hospitalised, closing of schools, the
> smoke, the stench etc.

> The public has a right to feel disaffected by this crisis, and is indignant

> flow.

What is for certain: a new jail soon is set to be opened on Thilafushi island
next month.
