Syrian rebels are turning to the world wide web for combat training. This is
the latest role being credited to social media, which has already won a
standing ovation worldwide for the role it has played in spreading news and
mobilizing citizens throughout this Arab Spring.

A YouTube channel under the name
[FSAHelp](http://www.youtube.com/user/fsahelp) (Free Syrian Army Help) [has
posted over 80
videos](https://twitter.com/quinnnorton/status/225407988511420416) aimed at
helping the Syrian opposition to learn different skills – from hand-to-hand
combat to [making flame-
throwers](https://twitter.com/Brown_Moses/status/226079632879931392) to the
basics of assault rifles to creeping up on an enemy from a hidden position.

On his blog, the author of Gary's Reflections
[wrote](http://garysreflections.blogspot.com/2012/07/youtube-used-to-train-
rebels.html):

Here's one of the videos which shows viewers how to assemble and clean a
Belgian type of rifle:

Comments posted on the videos are mainly in support for the FSA, and their
fight against the dictatorship in Syria, like this commenter [ar]:

الله يعينكم وينصركم على أعدائكم الأنجاس

[salooooooo7y](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mTKJkkPKiE): God be with you,
and help you beat your rotten enemies.

Others gave them tips, correcting some of the information in the videos:

وضعية الأنبطاح من أخطر الوضعيات خاصةً فالشوارع  
أذا حد رمى عليك قنبلة يدوية ما تقدر تهرب بسرعة

[sa3ood16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbJj_mmywVI): The prone position is
very risky, especially in street fights.  
If someone throws a grenade at you, you won't be able to run away quickly

It also seems that many viewers from Libya and Yemen have some experience to
add here. The same goes for [those who play video games like Metal
Gear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ivdUsLT7nU).

While people are re-enacting wars in video games, Syrian children are directly
impacted with what is going around them, and in the streets of
[Taftanaz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib_District), [they play “FSA vs.
Assad”, with wooden sticks as
rifles](https://twitter.com/Papakila/status/226880514219454464), as shown in
this video:

**Is posting such videos legal?**

Many are raising questions about the legality of such videos.

According to an article in Wired, [those videos are probably filmed in the
United States (or Canada)](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/07/syria-
youtube-facebook/), and then dubbed into Arabic.

In his blog, dedicated to firearms, [Steve Johnson wondered about the legality
of those videos according to the laws of the United
States](http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/07/17/syrian-supporters-
distributing-firearm-training-videos-on-youtube/):

> Is it legal for a US citizen to provide assistance to a foreign army or
> rebel group? I am unsure. Free speech, in practice, frequently ends at the
> border. It is perfectly legal to produce a firearm instructional video and
> upload it to Youtube for consumption inside the USA, but professional
> training video producers such as Magpul claim that their training videos are
> regulated by ITAR and require State Department permission to export outside
> the USA

Evakatrina compared such videos to [the case of Bradley
Manning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning), who is a US Army
soldier, and he was arrested in May 2010 in Iraq on suspicion of having passed
classified material to the whistleblower website WikiLeaks.

> @[evakatrina](https://twitter.com/evakatrina/status/226532582681112576): So
> #Manning “aided the enemy” but they can't prove he did harm. But guerrilla
> training for general public is ok?

And what about YouTube Safety Conduct?

In their “[Harmful and Dangerous
Conduct](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139838)“,
YouTube has stated under the United States section there (Same message is put
in the Canadian section of the page too):

> [W]e draw the line at content that’s intended to incite violence, encourages
> or shows dangerous or illegal activities that have an inherent risk of
> serious physical harm or death. This means not posting videos on things like
> instructional bomb making, instructional drug use, sniper attacks, or tips
> on illegal street racing.

FSAHelp also has presence on both Facebook and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fsahelp); however [their original Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/FSAHelp) has been deleted, but [another
one](https://www.facebook.com/fsahelp1) was created [later on
[Ar]](https://twitter.com/alnusra/status/226315248574009344). The people
behind the new page are suspecting that the new page, and may be even the
YouTube channel, might get deleted any time. They note:

بعد اعلان القناة الروسية عن صفحتنا، تم اغلاقها و لا نستبعد اغلاق قناة اليوتوب.
نرجو من الجميع تنزيل الفيديوهات في حال تم ذلك.

After the Russian TV channel mentioned our page, it has been deleted, and we
think the YouTube channel might get deleted anytime, so we urge you all to
download the videos just in case.

Finally, the question remains should rules be bent for the sake of supporting
the Syrian rebels in their fight against an oppressive regime? Or should rules
remain in place, given that there are worries the videos can still be used by
any terrorist group anywhere in the world? Also, should [German Intelligence
reports about the presence of Al-Qaida in
Syria](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/NG24Ak02.html) increase those
worries?

by [FSAHelp](http://www.youtube.com/user/fsahelp) showing viewers how to clean
and assemble a rifle.
