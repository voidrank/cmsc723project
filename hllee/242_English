Israeli human rights activists, who regularly join Palestinian demonstrators
in Bil'iin and [Sheikh
Jarrah](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/24/israel-activists-and-
bloggers-protest-against-deterioration-of-human-rights/), are recently blamed
for ignoring and even silencing an allegedly common phenomenon of sexual
harassment of women activists by fellow Palestinian demonstrators.

In the beginning of August 2010, _Haaretz_ gender columnist **Tsafi Saar**
stirred a feminist bloggers discussion on a problematic request raised by the
Sheikh Jarrah demonstration organizers, asking Israeli women to dress up
modestly for mutual demonstrations in East Jerusalem. Saar
[writes](http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,1018,209,53009,.aspx):

> “…They raised the old outrageous argument that feminists should restrain
> themselves and give up a few things for the greater, more important cause,
> of fighting the occupation. The organizers stressed this request came from
> Palestinian women who felt uncomfortable in the presence of fellow women
> with bare shoulders. The activists who resisted this request brought up the
> problem of the Palestinian women status in their society, and pointed out
> that this request is oppressing by nature.”

A week later, feminist activist and blogger **Hannah Beit-Halachmi** ,
revealed the existence of a “secret” low profile workshop offered to women and
transgendered activists on coping with sexual harassment at human rights
demonstrations. Beit-Halachmi captured [a screen shot](http://2nd-
ops.com/hanna/files/2010/08/indi.jpg) of the workshop details that was quickly
removed from [Israeli Indymedia](http://indymedia.org.il/) website, which
reads:

> “Israeli men, women and transgenders protest on weekly basis with their
> bodies against the occupation. Within this field of solidarity and mutual
> risk-taking lies a phenomenon of sexual harassment of activists and
> transgenders… within the field of direct action against occupation there is
> a role reversal in the power relations between occupiers (feminine tense in
> Hebrew – C.V) and occupied, dominant and dominated (feminine tense in Hebrew
> – C.V).”

Beit Halachmi [reacts](http://2nd-ops.com/hanna/?p=66922):

> “The existence of this workshop shows sexual harassment is a common
> phenomenon in left wing demonstrations. The demonstrators against
> occupations accept this reversed occupation because it doesn't really
> concern them – the victims are women. These women shoulders could be covered
> so the demonstrators could continue feeding their self-righteous allegedly
> liberal egos and carry the torch of social equality struggle. I recommend
> that women condition their participation in these demonstrations to the
> complete stop of any demonstration during which a sexual harassment occurs.
> The demonstrators should not demonstrate unless they reach an agreement with
> their Palestinian counterparts that there will be zero tolerance to this
> phenomenon and he who harasses should be shamefully and publicly banned from
> the demonstration. I am sorry that there is seemingly no real left wing in
> Israel and that left wing women are cooperating with this phenomenon”.

Last week the issue was raised again by lawyer and publicist Roni Aloni-
Sadovnik in a column she wrote for News First Class website titled ” [The left
wing betrays its raped
activists](http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-52114-00.html)“. Sadovnik
mentions a case [covered earlier
](http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1179618.html)by _Haaretz_ of an
attempted rape of an American peace activist in Beit Lechem. According to
_Haaretz_ , the Palestinian Authority has pressured the activist not to press
charges in order not to undermine the public opinion supportive of the
struggle against the occupation.

In her provocative column, Sadovnik speaks of another rape attempt on an
Israeli activist that was also pressured to put it aside for the greater
purpose, and refers to both as raped. She
[writes](http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-52114-00.html):

> “When Pacifist movements need to prioritize their agendas, it's clear that
> ending the occupation comes before protecting women. Are we finally facing
> the naked truth that these movements are actually pro-Islamic disguised as
> humanitarians? As a feminist, I feel the hypocrisy and loss of moral
> conscience in the galloping left wing persistent action to end the
> occupation, while they are dumbstruck facing this horror they encourage and
> collaborate in hiding it”.

In response to those allegations, The Sheikh Jarrah demonstration organizers
wrote a note on their Facebook page [denying
it](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=163579253655778&id=315087342867):

> “We take every case of harassment seriously and will stand against it as we
> stand against the breaking of every human right. The first rape attempt was
> made public due to the assistance of Israeli activists that helped report
> it. We have no knowledge of the other case and the allegation against us as
> accomplices to such silencing is slandering. We respect Sadovnik's
> reputation of feminist activism but we warned News First Class that if they
> do not delete this column we will consider pressing liability charges.”

Many of the supportive comments on [this
note](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=163579253655778&id=315087342867)
on Facebook claimed these allegations are a sophisticated attempt to sabotage
the struggle against the occupation, planned by right wing elements.

The above links were shared by many Israeli Facebook users over the last
couple of days, spiting similar debates between activists who claim this
impossible based on their personal experience, and women who stress that
sexual harassment is an everyday phenomenon that can be found in any place and
context and we shouldn’t be surprised it is found among human rights activists
as well. (Links to many of these additional debates cannot be provided due to
user's restricted Facebook privacy settings).

Some linked this debate with an earlier affair that stirred the blogosphere in
February 2010, as blogger **Eshkar Eldan Hacohen** confessed in [a personal
testimonial](http://www.haokets.org/default.asp?PageID=10&ItemID=4675) on
being raped 20 years ago by a well known humanist.

As other women who identified the attacker added their own testimonials, the
Press picked up the story and revealed the alleged rapist and serial harasser
to be no other than famous publicist, poet and peace activist **Itzhak Laor**.
That affair has sparked a similar discourse within the blogosphere on the
disconnection between human rights and women rights.
