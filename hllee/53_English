On March 24, 2014, the fifteenth anniversary of the beginning of the 1999
[NATO bombings of
Yugoslavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia), NATO
spokesperson and former BBC correspondent [Oana
Lungescu](https://twitter.com/NATOpress) retweeted (reposted) a tweet by
Kosovo Minister of European Integration [Vlora
Citaku](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku).

The tweet in itself was controversial because it contained a meme with the
altered, but still widely recognizable Nike logo, bastardized versions of the
Nike brand, Nike Air, and trademarked Nike slogan “Just do it”. Minister
Citaku's original tweet included the meme, which is what a few Twitter users,
both of Serbian and other nationalities, took issue with:

> 15 years ago NATO intervened to stop genocide in Kosovo! Will never forget!
> [pic.twitter.com/V6euDfgBoi](http://t.co/V6euDfgBoi)

However, what opened a flood of angry and disappointed comments from Twitter
users from around the world, including many Serbs, was Ms. Lungescu's
reposting of the original tweet on the official NATO Twitter account for press
relations. The [NATO spokesperson's
retweet](https://twitter.com/NATOpress/status/447837567426523136) of this
image, much more than Minister Lungescu's comment that accompanied it, was met
with outrage and deemed inappropriate and “a dumb move” by many.

Minister Citaku was also criticized by some Twitter users but defended her
stance on the matter by tweeting several comments related to the 1999 NATO
bombings, including this
[tweet](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku/status/448132778081533952) to a
Serbian critic:

> [@JelenaLilic2](https://twitter.com/JelenaLilic2) bombing helped Serbia
> liberate from Milosevic! Self victimization not helpful! Reflect on the
> past!

Minister Citaku also
[added](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku/status/447843992936660992):

> [@Solisio](https://twitter.com/Solisio) we never denied Serbian victims! But
> we should not lose the track of history.We all know how/when/why it started
> and why NATO acted
>
> — Vlora Citaku (@vloracitaku) [March 23,
> 2014](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku/statuses/447843992936660992)

This did not soothe critics after Minister Citaku's tweet went viral on
several social networks through NATO representative Oana Lungescu's promotion
of her tweet on official NATO communication channels. While many supported
Minister Citaku's stance and tweet, others still found some of it
inappropriate.

The majority of critics on Twitter responded to Ms. Lungescu's retweet, not
Minister Citaku's original tweet. [Andrej
Fajgelj](https://twitter.com/fajgelj/), a civil servant and member of Treća
Srbija (Third Serbia) political party, was among those who directed their
[response](https://twitter.com/fajgelj/status/448073891718889472) to the
@NATOPress Twitter account that Ms. Lungescu runs:

> [@NATOpress](https://twitter.com/NATOpress) Your idea of a tombstone for our
> children you have killed? I hope we'll know to respect them better
> [@vloracitaku](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku)

[Lily Lynch](https://twitter.com/lilyslynch/), a US journalist who lived in
Serbia for several years, also
[responded](https://twitter.com/lilyslynch/status/448085150522703873), taking
issue with the image included in the tweet:

> [@NATOpress](https://twitter.com/NATOpress)
> [@vloracitaku](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku) NATO, this is some bad PR.
> And I'm American. Using the Nike sweatshop logo to rally support for a
> bombing?

[Nebojša Krstić](https://twitter.com/Krle22/), a public relations professional
from Serbia, was among those who
[wondered](https://twitter.com/Krle22/status/448223926574129152) how a NATO
public relations official could publicize such a comment and controversial
image through an official channel.

In one of several long discussions on Twitter about this matter, an NGO
program director and board member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Serbia
[Darko Runić](https://twitter.com/DankoRunic/) also [drew
attention](https://twitter.com/DankoRunic/status/447867054620946432) to what
most have called inappropriate use of a well known brand by a government
official and a NATO representative:

> [@Petrit](https://twitter.com/Petrit)
> [@NATOpress](https://twitter.com/NATOpress)
> [@vloracitaku](https://twitter.com/vloracitaku) no need to educate me on
> jazz, my point is the deeply inappropriate (ab)use of Nike logo by a govt
> official

After users mentioned this matter to Nike on Twitter, the sportswear company
[replied](https://twitter.com/NikeSupport/status/448252523485601792) from its
official [@NikeSupport](https://twitter.com/NikeSupport/) account and made
this [statement](http://gonike.me/l/6015gq7F):

> … Thank you for contacting us and raising your concern. This is not an
> official Nike ad nor was Nike involved in the creation or posting of this
> image. We take misuse of our Brand and slogan seriously.

Nato spokesperson Ms. Lungescu stood by her retweet and made a
[statement](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2014&mm=03&dd=25&nav_id=89762)
later in the day to defend her action:

> NATO's spokesperson, however, maintains that it was appropriate for her to
> retweet the image on the same day. Late on Monday, Lungescu defended the
> gesture by saying that the retweet “in no way had the goal of disrespecting
> the victims of the 1999 conflict.”
>
> Instead, said she, it was “a retweet of a tweet thanking NATO for saving
> civilians from ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. NATO reacted quickly to protect
> people in Kosovo in 1999 and our peace mission KFOR continues to provide a
> safe environment for all people in Kosovo based on UN Security Council
> Resolution 1244.”
