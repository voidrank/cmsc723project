In the early hours of Saturday, riot police surrounded and beat hundreds of
camped Ukrainian protesters, many of whom were asleep, at Independence Square
in the capital Kyiv, the site of [week-long peaceful “Euromaidan”
rallies](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/29/euromaidan-how-ukraine-
came-to-be-rocked-by-protests/), in support of Ukraine's integration with
Europe.

According to citizen photos and videos, on November 30, 2013, the police tried
to intimidate and forcefully remove protesters from the square, by[ beating
them with batons, chasing unarmed protesters, and even kicking and beating
protesters who fell to the
ground](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/reports-police-forcefully-
break-up-protest-site-on-maidan-nezalezhnosti-this-morning-332674.html)
[photos, videos] while trying to escape. Witnesses say police did not
discriminate, beating young women and journalists, including a [Reuters
photographer Gleb Garanich](http://www.rferl.org/content/police-break-up-demo-
in-kyiv/25184978.html) [photo].

Journalist and blogger Mustafa Nayem shared a
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO7CeLXT2gg&feature=youtu.be) shot from
the center of the riot police crackdown. The videо below [warning: graphic
content] shows police encircling protesters at the base of the Independence
monument, beating everyone indiscriminately. Screams can be heard and people
shouting “What are you doing?!” and “Shame on you!”. The video ends with the
videographer escaping the monument site, which is completely filled with riot
police, while more screams are heard in the background.

Many have circulated another
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsfftePdDO4) [ru] shot by Danish
journalist Johannes Wamberg Andersen. As he speaks to an injured journalist
from Ukraine, riot police is shown in the back, dragging and kicking unarmed
protesters.

Radio Svoboda (RFE/RL), posted this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMdk1D1ktBw) from security cameras on
its YouTube account. The cameras recorded riot police chasing and beating
unarmed people in the center of Kyiv.

**Night before the brutal police attack**

After the Ukrainian government [failed to fulfill demands of
protesters](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/ukraine-yanukovych-
moscow-eu-summit) and sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in Vilnius on
November 29, coordinators of the protests called on people to regroup and
gather again on Sunday, December 1.

![Call for nation-wide protest circulated online. The text reads: "Defend your
children against \[Riot police\] and your country - against the dictatorship!
December 1 at 12:00"](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2013/11/Berkut-316x600.jpg)

A call to a nation-wide protest circulated online. The text reads: “Defend
your children against [Riot police] and your country – against the
dictatorship! December 1 at 12:00″

While some protesters went back to their homes after the announcement on
Friday, others remained through the night at the main protest site in Kyiv,
Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square).Reports say that the majority of
those attacked by police were students, some of whom had traveled from other
regions to participate in the Euromaidan rallies.

**“Square needed to be cleared for Christmas tree”**

According to city officials, police needed to disperse protesters so that the
square could [be prepared for installing the traditional Christmas
tree](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/reports-police-forcefully-break-
up-protest-site-on-maidan-nezalezhnosti-this-morning-332674.html) on the
square. According to media reports and eye-witness accounts, however, the
brutal force used by police was uncalled for and unjustified.

**Shock and anger spreads**

police brutality in Kyiv and other cities.The pictures of these spontaneous
protests were circulated widely on social media. [Radio
