This month marks the first anniversary of the
[siege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Homs) of the old city of Homs,
often described as the capital of the Syrian Revolution. Homs, one of the
first revolutionary Syrian cities to revolt against the tyranny of Bashar Al
Assad, along with 14 neighborhoods and districts of the old city, including
Baba Amr, Bab Sbaa, Khalidiya and Deir Balba, has been subjected to
bombardment by the Syrian regime, shelling and raids for more than two years,
making the daily survival even harder as food and medical supplies dwindle.

Homs…city under siege

In November 2012, Global Voices Online ran a post entitled [Homs, A
Revolutionary Syrian City in
Ruins](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/11/27/homs-a-revolutionary-syrian-
city-in-ruins/). The “siege” of the 14 neighborhoods in Homs is a special case
– and is not similar to other Syrian cities. It is a reminder of the siege of
Gaza. However, in Homs there are no secret tunnels to smuggle basic supplies,
medical aid and injured and sick people. In Homs, a few thousand people are
trapped in an area where there were 400,000 people residing.

In old Homs, there is no agricultural land to grow vegetables and fruit,
resulting in shortages in food supplies. This[ video

complaining about the lack of food:

There is also no hospital or medical center, [Al Amal Hospital was fully
destroyed on April 1, 2012]. Instead, some [ **warning: link to graphic video
showing an injured person undergoing an operation without anesthesia** ]
[makeshift hospitals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSKvr3wmv84) rely on
trainees to serve patients.

The government has also cut services such as electricity, water or
communications in the besieged neighbourhoods. Instead, the survival of the
inhabitants depends on water from wells, [electricity
generators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLJHpm07zmg) and the use of
satellite communications. There are no schools, universities or educational
institutions. Instead, hundreds of children are living daily bombings and
continuous daily shelling by mortar, rocket launchers, long-range missiles,
tanks and warplane raids.

Syrian activists posted this video on the Facebook page of [Break the siege of
Homs](https://www.facebook.com/Siege.on.Homs?fref=ts) on June 6, 2013,
revealing the destruction of the city.

The blog Greater Syria posted a heart-breaking story under the title [Yasin
and Maryam Sabbagh…End the Siege on
Homs](http://greatersyria.wordpress.com/2013/01/20/child-yasin-maryam-sabbagh-
end-the-siege-on-homs-2012013/), which describes the murder of a brother and
sister (Yassin and Maryam) who were killed by a mortar bomb, fired by the
regime’s forces in pro-regime districts, while playing outside their home. A
video of their martyrdom with an emotional comment said:

> A short while ago, a piece of news stabbed my heart hard and petrified my
> eyes in disbelief. […..] Maryam and Yassin Sabbagh drawing what their life
> has been limited to: mortars, shelling, darkness, fear, and destruction;
> deprived from education, from schools, from having friends and neighbours to
> play with, from enjoying the blessings of life like world’s children, from
> food and sanitary water, from electricity, from everything..

calls upon Syrians to support the revolution and not let the martyrs down. He
posted a letter written by an activist who reminded all Syrian activists of
their pledge to protect the revolution until it achieves its goals:
