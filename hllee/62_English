A trip to Kosovo nowadays would convince anyone that this country, far from
its sometimes negative reputation, has indeed a lot to offer. According to the
[World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/08/16/in-kosovo-helping-
young-people-join-society "Article worldbank Kosovo youth") data, more than 70
percent of Kosovo's population is under 35 years old, which surely explains
the fact that on the flight this Global Voices author made to the country's
capital Prishtina, half of the passengers were under 10 years old. This makes
for quite the start to an unusual holidays!

Kosovo youth, while having to deal with terrible unemployment rates of [55.3
percent](http://esk.rks-gov.net/eng/ "Kosovo agency of statistics"), manage to
energize the country and push the rough memories of
[war](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm "BBC Kosovo") further and
further away. US blogger [Adventurous
Kate](http://www.adventurouskate.com/kosovo-a-warm-welcome-from-a-newborn-
country/ "Adventurous Kate blog") comments how first-time visitors feel:

> **It’s my first time in Kosovo, and I don’t know what to expect.** Just the
> mention of “Kosovo” in America brings to mind an image of war, of death, of
> ethnic cleansing, of bombs. Even though this took place more than a decade
> ago, I’m wondering just what kinds of scars the country will bear.

Far off from the scars, what strikes the freshly arrived visitor most are
Prishtina's incredible cafés. Everyone should experience the taste of a
perfect macchiato on a sunny and well-designed terrace, looking over the
frenetic errands of passersby. It certainly is not a legend that the coffee
there sometimes tastes even better than an Italian one – we apologize to our
Italian friends for this, but it must be said!

Although it might be true that Prishtina's architecture, mostly grey and
anarchic buildings, is not its main attraction, the city is buoyant in its
attitude and style. Its walls are full of graffiti and other forms of street
art; the soul of the city appears on them an open book to visitors.

“I love colors” and “I love flowers” appear very frequently on the walls of
the city, mostly in the saddest parts.

Creative details are available on every corner in Kosovo.

Kosovo's people seem to look more towards the future than stay stuck in the
past praising war heroes or pacifist icons of Kosovo's battle for independence
from Serbia, like [Ibrahim Rugova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Rugova
"Wikipedia Rugova"). Kosovo, now the newest nation in Europe, was historically
a part of Serbia and previously Yugoslavia. The [1998-99 Kosovo
War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War) was fought between the forces of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, made up by Serbia and Montenegro at the
time, and the Kosovo rebel group known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),
with military air support from NATO, after [10 years of non-violent resistance
from the civil society of
Kosovo](http://peacemagazine.org/archive/v17n4p30.htm "Peace magazine Howard
Clark article").

Although portraits of Ibrahim Rugova, the first president of newly independent
Kosovo, as well as of the leaders of the armed resistance are visible here and
there, the general impression to the newcomer is that today's actors of Kosovo
are building up their own models. Witnessing the elections in Kosovo from
Prishtina in November 2013, [Darmon
Richter](http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2013/11/meanwhile-in-pristina-kosovo-
elections.html "Darmon Richter blog Kosovo") comments:

In the center of Prishtina, street art bearing Kosovo's first President
Ibrahim Rugova's image is still there, but the colors are washed out.

Somehow, Prishtina could appear as a “mini-Istanbul” in the sense that it is
sitting quite balanced between a post-Ottoman and a Western European culture.
[Kim's travel blog](http://hayoungkim.org/2013/09/09/10-kosovo-pristina/ "Kims
travel blog Kosovo"), from an American and Korean perspective, underlines the
surprising cosmopolitan atmosphere of the “city of love”:

> After visiting Pristina, I truly understood why people had been calling
> Kosovo a fast developing and energetic country. You could see the new
> buildings coming up everywhere, and could see foreigners traveling (majorly
> European) around the city and there were many exciting restaurants available

What comes out of it is, just like in the Turkish city of wonders, a
fascinating mixture of traditional silver art craft shops, highly modern new
cafés, a multitude of bakeries, some old mosques being rebuilt, and some
churches left to rot. In the center you can see some incredible buildings like
the Prishtina University library, which appears almost as an unidentified
object in the middle of the communist architecture that inhabits the rest of
the area. [Kim's travel blog ](http://hayoungkim.org/2013/09/09/10-kosovo-
pristina/ "Kims travel blog Kosovo")also mentions this building:

> You could see many historical buildings around the city, and you could tell
> Kosovars were very proud of them. University of Pristina, the best one in
> Kosovo, was structured nicely. Also right next to the university, there is
> Pristina National Library, which was quite impressive and weirdly designed.
> My friend who currently works at University of Pristina had explained to me

The flashy colors of a new way of life can not be ignored on the Pristhina
walls.

Prishtina is full of surprises for visitors from any origin. But as Kosovo is
young, it is growing and changing very quickly. So do not lose any more time
and, if you can, hop on the next plane or car and take a moment to discover
this promising city and its joyful contradictions. If you are quick enough,
there might still be a [piece of
cake](http://enjoypristina.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/sultan-pasta-baklava/)
there for you!
