With Islamists rising in post-revolution Egypt, fear of religious oppression
is growing among youth, minorities, and women. Recently, a group of Egyptian
women started a Facebook page in Arabic called “[Echoing
Screams](http://www.facebook.com/EchoingScreams)” pointing out sexism in their
society and the oppression that might be coming with the expected arrival of
Islamists in power. The group has also started an event “[Wearing Hijab in
solidarity with women](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=295942577092288)”
[ar] that had the following description:

إذا كان الحجاب حرية شخصية و ليس رمزا للعبودية يرضونه للمرأة التي ينظرون لها
كأداة جنسية و سلعة و عورة و لا يرضونه للرجال الذين إذا أرادوا إهانتهم قالوا
“الرجالة لبسوا طرح”, فلن يهاجم دعاة تحجيب المرأة الرجال إذا إختاروا إرتداء
الحجاب

They say the veil (Hijab) is a personal freedom and not a sign of enslaving
women whom they look at as a sex object, a commodity, an
[Awrah](http://www.answers.com/topic/awrah), yet they use Hijab as a reference
of disrespect when saying “men who wear hijabs” as to insult their manhood.
Thus, those who call on women to wear Hijab should not attack men if they
chose to wear Hijab.

The group posted several [pictures
](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=o.295942577092288&type=1)of men
wearing Hijab in the event page, one of which was taken from the [campaign
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/12/12/iran-men-in-hijab-to-support-
jailed-student/)that Iranians launched online two years ago in support of a
male student who was arrested for dressing up as a woman to escape Tehran, as
authorities claimed. Tunisian netizens have also taken part in this event and
have commented with laughter on the event's wall, leaving sarcastic comments
against the [Ennahda ](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennahda)party, which won a
majority in Tunisia's constituent elections last month, and its head Rached
Ghannouchi.

[fr] on the event with criticism to Ghannouchi:

> je suis pour le droit des frérots de porter le hijab.solidarité avec
> ghanoucha qui préfère le tchadri

I support my brothers who want to wear Hijab in solidarity with Ghannouchi who
prefers the [Chador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chador)!

[Ines Ben Hamida ](http://www.facebook.com/inesbh86)was not optimistic about
the event in her
[comment](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=296160877070458&id=295942577092288)
[fr]:

> Les hommes est ce que vous pouvez mettre le voile pour nous je défie que
> vous seriez minorité minimine malheureusement :(

Men who will wear Hijab in solidarity will unfortunately be a small minority.

An Egyptian user called [لا للرجعية والتطرف
](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002108145705)(no to backwardness
and extremism)
[wrote](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=296123087074237&id=295942577092288)
[ar] he was against abusing religion in the name of politics:

لا لاستخدام شعارات دينية ولتسيس الدين، فالدين من المقدسات والمسلمات الدينية
المطلقة، والسياسة من المتغيرات التى تقبل الخلاف والإختلاف

No to using religious signs and no to politicizing religion. Religion is
sacred and religious beliefs are agreed upon while political changes are open
to interpretation and disagreement.

Another Egyptian [Amre El-Abyad
](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=596531430) wrote a [comment
](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=296123100407569&id=295942577092288)about
the role the Arab Spring should play in empowering women:

> Arab Spring should not be about toppling dictators. Democracy starts at the

The only male to have posted his picture was [Magdy Abdelraheem
](http://www.facebook.com/Phoenician.Pharaoh)saying he is showing solidarity:

[Sa Neb ](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000870632471)went to
[discuss](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=296013827085163&id=295942577092288)
[ar] whether Hijab is a religious obligation or not:

إذا إرتدي الرجال الحجاب تضامنا مع النساء أصبح ذلك إعتراف منهم أن الحجاب جزء من
أنثوية المرأة ، وأنا لا أراه فرضاً إسلامياً أصلاً

If men wore Hijab in solidarity with women that will be a confession that
Hijab is part of a woman's femininity and I do not see it as an Islamic must.
