As the carnage and horror coming out of Libya continues to dominate our
timelines, top Muslim cleric Youssef Al Qaradawi issued a fatwa (religious
edict) calling for anyone who can pull the trigger, to kill Colonel Muammar
Qaddafi and end the suffering of Libyans.

Meanwhile, both Egypt and Tunisia, which have had popular uprisings which have
toppled Hosni Mubarak and Zein El Abdideen Ben Ali respectively, and which
also flank Libya, have opened their borders for humanitarian relief to reach
Libyans, under attack from the Gaddafi regime.

Following some of the reactions from Twitter:
