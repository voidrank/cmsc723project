Computer science legend [Dennis
Ritchie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) died on October 8, 2011
in his home in New Jersey at the age of 70, leaving behind a legacy of
enormous impact on global development. Ritchie was the developer of the [C
programming
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_\(programming_language\)), one of the
most widely used programming languages of all time.

According to Xeni Jardin of
[BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2011/10/12/dennis-
ritchie-1941-2011-computer-scientist-unix-co-creator-c-co-inventor.html) on
October 12, one of the first to report the news publicly was Canadian software
engineer [Rob Pike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike) via
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP?hl=en).
Like Ritchie, he is known for his work at [Bell
Labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs).

The official blog of [Taxgedo](http://www.tagxedo.com/) (a web application to
make word clouds) used the words from Ritchie's seminal textbook [“The C
Programming
language”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28book%29)
to create a [word cloud](http://blog.tagxedo.com/rip-dennis-ritchie-father-of-
unix-and-c) as a tribute, and wrote:

A commenter in a science and technology news forum on Overclock.net named
[Andygoyap](http://www.overclock.net/technology-science-news/1140545-google-
rip-dennis-ritchie-creator-c.html) even compared him to [Sir Isaac
Newton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), one of the most important
physicists and mathematicians in history.

Anyone who hasn't studied basic programming (with some version of C as their
first object-oriented programming language) might find it hard to grasp the
importance of such a modest and private person. Ritchie neither flaunted his
achievements nor became a business icon.

Most modern computer operating systems such as
[GNU/Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux) and Apple's [Mac
OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS) directly descend from UNIX. Computers
running UNIX or GNU/Linux basically provide the infrastructure for the
Internet, either as servers or routers, or platforms for running applications
like Google web search.
