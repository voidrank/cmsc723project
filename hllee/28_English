There was [extensive debate](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/11/15/what-
world-leaders-should-discuss-at-brisbanes-g20-summit/) about what should have
been discussed at Brisbane’s G20 summit on 15-16 November. As Clarencegirl
shared on her blog [North Coast
Voices](http://northcoastvoices.blogspot.com.au/2014/11/dear-tony-regards-
francis.html), even Pope Francis had ideas for that very public member of his
Catholic flock, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott:

> …there are far too many women and men suffering from severe malnutrition, a
> rise in the number of the unemployed, an extremely high percentage of young
> people without work and an increase in social exclusion which can lead to
> criminal activity and even the recruitment of terrorists. In addition, there
> are constant assaults on the natural environment, the result of unbridled
> consumerism, and this will have serious consequences for the world economy.

So what actually happened both in private meetings and the official forums?
Netizens have had lots to say.

A [speech](http://nofibs.com.au/2014/11/15/obamas-brisbane-climate-clarion-
call-to-australia-and-the-world/) by US President Barack Obama outside the
official forum called on Australia “to step up” on climate change. It received
lots of praise, including Meg Watson at [Junkee](http://junkee.com/president-
obama-shirtfronts-tony-abbott-asks-young-australians-to-step-up-and-take-
action-on-climate-change/45314):

> You know when your dad’s been away for a while and he lays into you about
> not taking the rubbish out while he was gone? He says he’s not mad, just a
> little disappointed, then goes into an inspiring speech about how we all
> have to do our part around the house. That’s essentially what just happened
> to our entire country. President Obama has only been in Australia for a
> matter of hours and he’s already incited people to take action on climate
> change.

The view of well-known lawyer and human rights activist Julian Burnside was a
popular retweet:

> Obama's speech to UQ students will inspire a generation. Abbott's opening
> speech at [#G20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/G20?src=hash) was profoundly
> embarrassing. [#auspol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash)

Abbott’s opening speech copped more criticism:

The satirical website Shovel was at work slamming his local content:

Many have been disappointed by the lack of aggression in the meeting of
Australian PM Tony Abbott and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. There was no sign of
Abbott’s threatened
“[shirtfront](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/tony-abbott-says-
he-will-shirtfront-vladimir-putin-over-downing-of-mh17)”.

It seemed to be time for cuddling and making up, according to @lynlinking:

Meanwhile, protests went ahead as expected with only a few arrests on
Saturday. It is a sign of the times that independent legal observers were
present to monitor events. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-

Any concerns that climate change and Ebola wouldn’t get into the [final
communiqué](https://www.g20.org/sites/default/files/g20_resources/library/brisbane_g20_leaders_summit_communique.pdf)
were dispelled:

Commitments to economic growth (an extra 2.1 percent of GDP by 2018) and
reform were given the thumbs up by many online:

> The [@dailytelegraph](https://twitter.com/dailytelegraph) declares
> [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama) “hijacked” the

However, Robert Fairhead was cynical about real economic outcomes:

> Communique, shmunique! Bet 10 yrs on, nada! HT

Ukraine didn’t make the communiqué, but Vladimir Putin was blasted by other
leaders off stage apparently. Ed Johnson, Sydney bureau chief at Bloomberg
News, mused:

> Putin stares down [#G20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/G20?src=hash) storm of

Outside the summit, Tim O'Keefe captured protesters against Putin on video:

Finally, the Ebola crisis managed to make the agenda:

So was the 400 million Australian dollars (350 million US dollars) spent on
the G20 summit by the Australian government, value for money? You be the
judge!
