Argentinian footballer [Lionel
Messi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi) has broken most football
records including the number of goals scored in a season, or has he?

An unlikely challenger to Messi, who is a marvel to watch when he turns up for
his Spanish la Liga team FC Barcelona, has emerged in Zambia – in the form of
a footballer who died nearly 20 years ago.

[Godfrey Chitalu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Chitalu) was with 30
other team members and administrators when [a plane carrying the Zambia
National
Team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Zambia_national_football_team_air_disaster)
to a World Cup outing in Senegal crashed in Gabon on April 28, 1993.

Godfrey Chitalu was well known by his moniker Ucar, and at the time of his
death was National team coach. Ucar which almost became like his middle name –
originated from his boundless energy on the pitch like the battery UCAR (made
by Union Carbide) which powered the two-band radio sets people listened to
football commentaries on.

One website, the [Bleacher
Report](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1440990-godfrey-chitalu-did-
zambian-striker-score-more-goals-than-lionel-messi), noted of Chitalu who is
reputed to have scored 107 goals in the 1972 season:

> Don't rewrite that record book just yet—unless the name Godfrey Chitalu is
> going in.

On Twitter, the name Godfrey Chitalu went viral after western media reported
Messi’s supposed record breaking goal-scoaring.

> Dear Messi, yes you've surpassed Gerd Muller's record but not Godfrey
> Chitalu's 107 goals in a calendar year 1972. *In MJ's voice – Beat it*

One tweep disputing Messi’s record and seemingly accusing western media of
biasness, wrote:

UKZambians, a citizen media website based in the UK,
[quoted](http://www.ukzambians.co.uk/home/2012/12/11/zambias-godfrey-chitalu-
is-world-goal-record-holder-not-lionel-messi/) a Football Association of
Zambia (FAZ) official:

Arguably, Zambia’s football at that time was not as professional as it is
today, but football-loving Zambians can only hope that at least their record
keeping improves from this story.
