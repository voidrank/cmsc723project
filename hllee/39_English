@rexremitio: Unlike politicians, commuters in Metro Manila have been taking
the #MRTChallenge every day

Not amused by Philippine government officials responding to the Ice Bucket
Challenge, netizens have dared top-ranking officials to instead take the
#MRTRushHourChallenge and #PNRRushHourChallenge.

Netizens called on officials to ride the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) as well as
the Philippine National Railways (PNR), which run across the country’s
national capital region, during the rush hour to experience for themselves the
difficulties that ordinary commuters experience every day.

Owned by private company MRT Corporation and operated in partnership with the
Department of Transportation and Corporation, the MRT has been plagued by long
lines that stretch for hours, technical glitches, and congested coaches.

Meanwhile, passengers of the state-owned PNR are complaining of [deteriorating
service](http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/focus/08/26/14/pnr-only-6-50-trains-
are-working) as government continues to give inadequate subsidy for the
country's public railways.

MRT also figured in [a recent accident on August
13](http://www.mb.com.ph/mrt-3-train-overshot-rail-line/) when one of its
train coaches derailed, injuring some of its passengers.

An online petition by Dinna Dayao on
[Change.org](http://www.change.org/p/president-benigno-aquino-iii-please-
require-all-public-officials-to-take-public-transit-once-a-month) calls on
President Benigno ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III to require all public officials take
public transit at least once a month. The petition has garnered over 12,000
signatures.

Senator Grace Poe
[took](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/376927/news/nation/senator-grace-
poe-takes-mrt-challenge) the #MRTChallenge. But Transportation [Secretary Jun
Abaya](http://www.interaksyon.com/article/94310/tale-of-2-mrt-riders--before-
grace-poe-transport-chief-abaya-takes-train-but-draws-more-flak) was
criticized by netizens for taking the coach for the elderly and disabled on a
slow hour, escorted by bodyguards, and complete with full media coverage.
President Aquino himself has [refused to take the
challenge](http://www.newsgra.ph/0340/pnoy-refuses-to-take-mrt-challenge/).

Here are some of the reactions on Twitter which reflect the growing
dissatisfaction of train riders in Metro Manila:

The popularity of these rush hour challenges is an indicator of the depth of
the riding public's increasing discontent with the country's privatized mass
transit system. Authorities should quickly respond to the challenge by fixing
the problems besetting the train service in the nation's capital.
