Though Internet users only recently
[debunked](https://globalvoices.org/2015/12/11/debunking-rumors-about-japans-
anti-muslim-restrictions/) a false English-language meme about Japan's alleged
restrictions on Muslims, it's far from true that Japan necessarily welcomes
immigrants and refugees with open arms.

In fact, following widespread global media coverage last fall of [the flow of
refugees from Turkey to Greece and then into other parts of
Europe](https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/streams-of-refugees-seek-
sanctuary-in-europe/) resulted in Japan's own particularly nasty viral meme
about the crisis.

A cartoon shared widely on Facebook in Japan in September and October accuses
refugees of “faking” their plight. The poster contains the cartoon image of a
young girl, with the caption: “I want to live a safe and clean life, eat
gourmet food, go out, wear pretty things, and live a luxurious life… all at
the expense of someone else. I have an idea. I'll become a refugee.”

The image was created and uploaded by cartoonist [Hasumi
Toshiko](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1437610). While the message was
shocking enough in terms of its utter lack of empathy towards the plight of
refugees, who are fleeing war and insecurity, Hasumi also decided to base his
drawing on a real picture—one taken by photographer [John
Hyams](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34460325) of a young Syrian
girl, which was used for a [Save The Children
campaign](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34460325).

Following a request by Hyams and[ a petition reportedly signed by more than
10,000 people in Japan](http://netgeek.biz/archives/51668), Hasumi removed the
image.

### Japan's ‘closed door’ refugee policy

The case of Hasumi Toshiko demonstrates that while Japan is generally an open
and tolerant society, Internet culture in that country can be just as
insensitive and downright corrosive as anywhere else, if given the chance.

On the other hand, others argue that, no matter how tolerant Japanese society
is towards Muslims and other minorities, when compared to other wealthy
countries such as Canada and Germany who have committed to accepting refugees,
the Japanese government is equally committed to putting up roadblocks to keep
refugees out.

Japan receives far fewer asylum seekers than other wealthy nations. [In 2013
Australia received 24,300](http://www.dw.com/en/no-country-for-refugees-japan-
and-south-koreas-tough-asylum-policies/a-18037765) people seeking asylum, and
Germany received 109,600. In contrast in that same year Japan accepted just
3,300—and very few of these people would be formally accepted as refugees.

In 2014 [Japan received 5,000
applications](http://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00107/) for refugee status,
but the country's Immigration Bureau ruled only 11, or just 0.2%, of the 5,000
applicants to be worthy of recognition and asylum as refugees.

In fact, Japan is often called “[a country with a closed door for
refugees.](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/open-wallet-closed-doors-
exploring-japans-low-acceptance-asylum-seekers)“

Japan's procedure for processing refugees is often described as slow and
uncoordinated, resulting in long delays. NGO [Japan Association for Refugees
says](https://www.refugee.or.jp/en/):

> There is no time framework set forth for the administrative procedures of
> refugee recognition, and there was such a case as taking 9 years (!) to
> reach a final decision?

There is little formal support for the 12,000 or so people seeking asylum in
Japan, who are prohibited from working while waiting for a decision about
whether or not they will be accepted by the authorities.

It's often observed [Japan would prefer to deal with refugees at a
distance](http://japanfocus.org/-Iwasaki-Atsuko/1788/article.html), through
financial aid. [According to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e488196.html#), Japan was also the
second largest contributor to the UN refugee agency in 2014, [donating more
than $181 million](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/open-wallet-closed-
doors-exploring-japans-low-acceptance-asylum-seekers).

### What does birth rate have to do with it?

Speaking before the United Nations in September 2015, Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe promised to contribute $1.5 billion in aid to Middle East.

Abe also explicitly stated Japan's opposition to accepting more refugees. In a
Japanese-language press conference ([Part
1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRby90S582M&feature=youtu.be), [Part
2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVYvJgBPDKI&feature=youtu.be)), he not only
shut the door on accepting more refugees, but also tied refugee settlement
with immigration policy, saying, “[Before accepting immigrants or
refugees](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/japan-says-it-must-
look-after-its-own-before-allowing-syrian-refugees-in), we need to have more
activities by women, elderly people – and we must raise our birth rate.”

The reply, at the UN headquarters in New York, struck some as odd, because it
seemed to conflate Japan's plummeting population with the refugee crisis.

In any event, since Japan, due to its geographic location, is relatively
isolated from conflicts around the world, it may be difficult to persuade a
majority of Japanese people that more must be done to accept refugees. And
it's difficult to determine how much support there is in Japan for accepting
more refugees.

An informal straw poll conducted by opinion aggregator site [Ironna asks the
question](http://ironna.jp/theme/248):

> 移民を原則受け入れないとする現行制度についてどう思いますか？

> What do you think about Japanese policy of not accepting immigrants?

Out of about 3,200 respondents, 2,700 answered:

> 移民の受け入れを縮小すべき

> We should restrict immigration.
