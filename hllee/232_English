Qatar's World Cup delegation reacts to FIFA's announcement on Thursday (BBC
screen grab)

Euphoria, disbelief, jeers and cheers filled the Internet following FIFA's
announcement that Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup.

In Qatar, a tiny, oil-rich desert country that beat out bids from the United
States, South Korea, Japan and Australia in hosting the football world cup,
the mood was jubilant among expats and nationals alike.

And on the popular social networking forum _[Qatar

Though most expats don't plan on living in Qatar during the 2022 World Cup,
many reveled in the good news.

On _[Qatari Adventures](http://qatariadventures.blogspot.com/2010/12/expect-
amazing.html)_ , expat blogger Sybil Knox explained her elation:

But not everyone had good things to say about FIFA's announcement.

At [Hack the Bone](http://hackthebone.blogspot.com/2010/12/initial-thoughts-
on-qatars-world-cup.html), a former expat congratulates Qatar, and then it
gives it a stern talking to.

> Right now, there is no way Qatar could host the World Cup. The

>  Luckily for FIFA, Doha is developing at an alarming rate, thanks to the

Even Qataris have mixed feelings about hosting the World Cup. On[ Mimiz
Blog](http://mimizwords.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/541/), Mimi provides a
breakdown of the arguments.

> When I asked why do you support 2022? people said that it will change Qatar
> forever, bring more investments and develop the economy. It will put Qatar
> on the map side by side with greatest countries in the world. It will also
> force a change in Qataris’ traditional mindset towards more openness which
> is necessary for development.  
>  Those who disagreed on the other hand argued that the 22 billion budget
> will be spent on foreigners while it could be better spent on local
> development and help improve the condition of poor Qataris. 2022 could
> infringe citizen’s rights rather than improve life quality. It has no
> benefits whatsoever for Qataris and will only lead to more loss of identity.

Many on the Tweetosphere expressed disbelief that Qatar beat out the US for
the bid, painting the victory as David vs. Goliathesque.

Speaking of Twitter, Qatar's Twitterati finally got their wish for the nation
to become a trending topic, but it was a bittersweet victory. Instead of
#Qatar, #Quater and #Kattar made the list.
