On the eve of Ramadan, Syrian troops have [entered the city of
Hama](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903341404576479362539155514.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter),
reportedly killing [as many as
45](https://twitter.com/#!/AlArabiya_Eng/status/97577417639604224) people by
11:00 am on Sunday, July 31. The assault has particular resonance for Syrians,
as the city of Hama was the site of one of the most horrific
[massacres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama_massacre) in modern history.

Most tweets at this early hour are links to news, though many from within
Syria, and abroad have condemned the killings, with some expressing anger at a
perceived lack of international outrage. Still others, such as
[deekelgen963](https://twitter.com/#!/deekelgen963/status/97568481054162944),
expressed doubt about the reporting from Hama.

Of the view original reports coming across the Twitter lines, one stands out.
_Debkafile_ reports: “Water, power, phone lines cut for Hama's 400,000
inhabitants”.

Meanwhile, from inside Hama, a few videos have emerged.

One shaky video from the [Shams News
Network](http://www.youtube.com/user/SHAMSNN) shows tanks entering the city:

Another video shows black smoke rising up from within the city:

_BBC_ journalist Shaimaa Khalil pointed to live streaming video coming from
Hama, the archive of which is available [here](http://qik.com/mubasher-hama).

Without the presence of professional journalists in Hama, reporting is reliant
on activists and citizen journalists, for whom capturing images and videos
comes with considerable risk. As a result, news is often slow to trickle out,
but some Syrian activists, such as
@[wissamtarif](http://twitter.com/wissamtarif) and
@[malathaumran](https://twitter.com/malathaumran) are continuously tweeting
news.
