Arrigoni – known as [Vik](https://twitter.com/VikUtopia) – has been in Gaza
for over two years with the [International Solidarity
Movement](http://palsolidarity.org/) (ISM). (See this [Global
Voices](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/12/from-italy-to-palestine-
vittorio-arrigoni-writes-from-gaza/) post about him.) Gaza blogger Omar
Ghraieb writes that Arrigoni's kidnappers are [threatening to kill
him](http://gazatimes.blogspot.com/2011/04/vittorio-arrigoni-ism-worker-
kidnapped.html):

The [video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2XtPcDprbM) Arrigoni's kidnappers
released has since been disabled. It showed Arrigoni blindfolded, having been
beaten, with text rolling over the screen detailing the demands of his
captors.
