February 11th marked the third anniversary of Yemen's revolution which toppled
former President Ali Abdullah's Saleh's 33 year rule. Just a day before, on
February 10, Yemen's president Abdu Rabu Mansour, based on the [National
Dialogue](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/02/09/will-the-end-of-the-
national-dialogue-bring-peace-to-yemen/)‘s recommendation for the political
transition and after deliberating with a Region Defining Committee, approved
[turning the country into a six-region federation
state](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/10/us-yemen-politics-
idUSBREA190VH20140210?rpc=401&feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&rpc=401).

Nadia Al-Sakkaf, an activist, member of the National Dialogue and editor-in-
chief of The Yemen Times, tweeted:

The federal system was a solution to counter the failure of the centralized
government and to give the south more autonomy while preserving Yemen's unity.
Yemen's parties had been divided on whether to split the federation into two
or six regions. A north-south divide which was suggested by Southerners was
rejected due to fear that it could set the stage for the south to secede. The
six agreed regions included four in the north, comprising Azal, Saba, Janad
and Tihama, and two in the south, Aden and Hadhramaut.

Azal includes the capital Sanaa, which will be a federal city not subject to
any regional authority, in addition to the provinces of Dhamar, Amran and
Saada. Aden would comprise the capital of the former south, as well as Abyan,
Lahej and Daleh. The southeastern Hadhramaut province would include Al-Mahra,
Shabwa and the island of Socotra, while Saba comprises Bayda, Marib and Al-
Jawf. Janad would include Taez and Ibb, and Tahama also takes in Hudaydah,
Rima, Mahwit and Hajja.

There were many reactions among Yemenis and Arabs both for and against this
decision.  
Yemeni youth activist, Jamal Badr jokingly tweeted a still shot from a scene
of a famous Egyptian comic play:

Farea Almuslimi disapproving the haste in the decision making tweeted:

Yet there were many questions in people's minds, which Sam Waddah raised on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=591208527625828&set=a.103653093048043.7771.100002100572787&type=1&comment_id=1772217&offset=0&total_comments=10):

Nadia Al-Sakkaf shed some light on the new federal system in her article in
[The Yemen Times](http://www.yementimes.com/en/1754/news/3462/Yemen-
celebrates-new-map-of-six-regions.htm):

> The relationship between the regions and the federal government will be

Three years after the revolution, on February 11, Yemenis were back on the
streets but for various reasons. There were those who went out to celebrate
the anniversary of a revolution which awed the world with its power and
peacefulness and there were those who went out to protest against the
government's corruption and for not realizing the revolution's
[demands](http://notesbynoon.blogspot.ae/2011/09/demands-of-yemens-peaceful-
youth.html?spref=tw).

Majda Al-Hadad, an activist spearheading the campaign against the government's
continuous electricity power cuts tweeted:

> لاحاجة لان اعدد اسباب خروجي غدا, فلايوجد ماهو ايجابي ليجعلني اتردد. لاحفوف
> لاكرامة لاقانون لاعدل ولا وجود للحكومة الا بالفساد

“ _The people want to topple corruption_ “, “ _the people want the fall of the
government_ “, “ _a new revolution all over again_ “, “ _oh government of
corruption, leave the country_ ” chanted protesters across the streets of
Sanaa.

This video by [SupportYemen](http://supportyemen.org/) is a reminder of what
the revolution was about and what it still needs to achieve:

And as Rooj Al-Wazir, tweeted, some of the revolutionary youth, three years
later, were still behind bars:

Many Yemenis did not feel a change in their daily living conditions – quite
the contrary, many were disappointed and frustrated with its deterioration. In
a question posed on Facebook by journalist [Ahmed
Ghurab](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=778924042136833&id=100000577346649&stream_ref=10),
“In your opinion what change has occurred in the living conditions of the
average citizen in the last three years since the outbreak of the
revolution?!!”, the majority complained about the hike in prices, the
continuous power outages, the insecurity and instability along with the
increase of assassinations, the car explosions and kidnappings and the failure
of the government to address or manage these issues.

Nevertheless, there were those who were celebrating the revolution's
achievements so far and were still hoping for more. Photos of the marches all
over Yemen commemorating the third anniversary of the start of the revolution
were posted all over Twitter and Facebook.
