Moroccans are taking a stand tomorrow (March 17) in protest against the
[plight](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/15/morocco-minor-forced-to-
marry-her-rapist-commits-suicide/) of 16-year-old Amina Filali, who committed
suicide after being forced to marry the man who raped her. Amina's marriage to
her rapist was approved by a judge. Her suicide has raised a storm of
reactions both on social networks and on the ground.

Moroccans are planning to take their protest to the Parliament at noon
tomorrow, in order to draw attention to the plight of women like Amina who are
forced to marry their rapists, who also get to escape punishment.

A Facebook
[page](https://www.facebook.com/RIPAminaNonAuViolAvecLaCompliciteDeLEtat/info),
entitled No to Rape, with the Complicity of the State, states [ar]:

موعدنا جميعا إذن يوم السبت 17 مارس أمام البرلمان على الساعة 12 ضهراً ، لكي
تبقى ذكرى أمينة حية فينا، فلا يكون موتها عبثا لعلها تكون أخر ضحية لمثل هذا
الفعل الشنيع المخزي.

Our meeting is on Saturday, March 17, in front of the Parliament, at noon.
This is so that Amina's memory remains alive. We don't want her death to be in
vain. Perhaps should be the last victims of such despicable and shameful acts.
