_**This post is part of our special coverage[Libya Uprising
2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/libya-uprising-2011/).**_

Shortly after the UN Security Council-imposed no-fly zone over Libya was to
take effect, Colonel Muammar Al Gaddafi's government said it would halt its
hostilities in the country.

In a vote of 10 in favor and five abstentions, the United Nations Security
Council passed [resolution
1973](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm), “all necessary
measures” to protect civilians from pro-Gaddafi forces and to find a peaceful
solution to the fighting that began when government forces began attacking
anti-regime protesters.

A wide view of the Security Council as 5 Members—China, Brazil, Germany, India
and the Russian Federation—indicate their abstentions on resolution 1973
(2011) which authorizes the use of military force, including a no-fly zone, in
Libya. Photo from the UN.

First, we have Tweeps covering the press conference with Foreign Minister
Moussa Koussa, who presented the Gaddafi government's first formal reaction to
the resolution.

**‘It's a lie’**  
Tweeps met the call for ceasefire with sustained boos and pleas to ignore it:

**Attacks around the country**  
Here is some news from the ground. For the past few days, Gaddafi forces have
been attacking [Misurata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misurata), going so far
as to claim the city was under government control. However, those attacks
[continue](http://www.sify.com/news/clashes-continue-as-gaddafi-vows-to-
recapture-misurata-news-international-ldsaOncejgc.html) on Friday, March 18 on
Libya's third-largest city:

**Warning: Graphic Content.** Here is a video, uploaded by
[marco1702](http://www.youtube.com/user/marco1702) last week, showing fighting
in Misurata.

Tweeps also report fighting in other parts of the country.

Continued fighting leads a few to wonder the effectiveness of a no-fly zone:

Rumors fly of explosions in Tripoli:

**Debating the No-Fly Zone**  
Let's step back a minute a cover some of the debate on the no-fly zone. Some
say it is too little too late.

To counter the perception that a no-fly zone won't change military realities
on the ground, reports have surfaced that anti-Gaddafi forces are now publicly
receiving weapons from abroad.

I couldn't find much on what the opposition forces feel about the UN's
actions, but I did come across this:
