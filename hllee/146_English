On June 3, 2012, about 65 girls were [rushed to
hospital](http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/afghanistan/2012/06/120603_mar_takhar_school.shtml)
[fa] after being poisoned at their school in the northeastern Afghan province
of [Takhar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takhar_Province). The incident was
the latest in a series of attacks against schools for girls in the province.
On May 29, some 160 girls [ended up in
hospitals](http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-school-poisoning-
suspected-160-schoolgirls-ill/24596772.html) after a gas attack at their
school. Earlier this spring, more than 270 girls were poisoned in anti-school
attacks in two different locations. Overall, hundreds of girls throughout the
country suffered in similar attacks last year.

Officials have blamed the Taliban for these incidents. Between 1996 and 2001,
when the fundamentalist movement controlled most of the country, females were
banned from going to school. Although millions of girls have enrolled in
school since the ousting of the Taliban, the movement's fighters and their
sympathizers continue punishing female students for seeking education.

Because females continue facing abuse and violent attacks for seeking
education, it takes a lot of bravery to be a schoolgirl in Afghanistan. Image

The Taliban has denied its involvement in the anti-school attacks. Yet, they
can hardly convince anybody.

The enemies of Afghanistan are now resorting to a new tactic in their war
against the government [of the country]. This tactic consists of poisoning
schoolgirls, aiming to close down educational institutions in different
provinces… This can seriously compromise a decade of achievements such as the
opening of new schools after the fall of the Taliban regime

For some people, reports of anti-school attacks in Afghanistan are a reason to
reconsider their attitude towards education. Dineeta Kubhar

Netizens fear that after the NATO-led foreign troops pull out of the country
in 2014, the Taliban and other fundamentalists will become even more tenacious
in scaring girls off education.
