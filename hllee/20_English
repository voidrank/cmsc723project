Over 800 refugees died in the disaster off the coast of Libya last month.
According to a [report](http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/europe-s-
sinking-shame-the-failure-to-save-refugees-and-migrants-at-sea) by Amnesty
International, the boat carrying the refugees capsized after too many people
surged to one side in order to reach a merchant ship that was offering
assistance.

Sadly, the April 18 disaster was not the only one to have occurred in recent
months. The European border organisation, Frontex, which provided a mandate to
Operation Triton to to monitor the coasts of the EU’s external borders in
November 2014, says it can no longer afford large-scale rescue work and is
committed to monitoring and surveillance only, while the national coastguards
of the EU member states and commercial vessels do what they can to effect
rescues.

That is unfortunate, because Operation Triton's predecessor, [Mare
Nostrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mare_Nostrum), was credited
with saving thousands of lives during its one-year existence. Although the EU
has faced [criticism](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/prantls-politik-ein-
plan-der-den-namen-nicht-verdient-1.2446306) for its new non-humanitarian
approach to sea-bound migration, Mare Nostrum cost more money than Operation
Triton and migration as a whole is politically unpopular: some are concerned a
coordinated rescue operation lowers the risks involved in boat crossings and
thus increases the number of refugees and migrants planning to make them.

Nevertheless, Operation Triton has been unable to halt the influx of refugees
to Europe. Amnesty International [claims
](http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/europe-s-sinking-shame-the-
failure-to-save-refugees-and-migrants-at-sea)a drastic increase in the numbers
of people trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2015 compared to the same
period in 2014. According to the group's report, 2015 saw a 42 % increase in
irregular border crossings in the first two months of 2015.

Several organisations and civilians continue to press for a response from EU
institutions and for a large-scale, coordinated rescue programme:

A number of private initiatives and organisations have sprung up over the last
few years to plug the gaps in the political system. These initiatives and
organisations are aiming to mitigate the situation in the Mediterranean in
their own ways.

**As politicians idle, citizens take the initiative**

Harald Höppner founded the Sea Watch initiative together with other volunteers
in the wake of last year's [Lampedusa
shipwreck](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/lampedusa-shipwreck/) that
killed 366 migrants to combat the worsening situation on the Mediterranean.

Sea Watch was brought to life by a number of families in Brandenburg, Germany
and is currently run by a dozen volunteers from all over the country. The
project, financed by private donations, aimed to use its own boat to oversee
the maritime area between Malta and the Libyan coast, to provide first aid to
boats in distress, and to report on their experiences at sea to the public.
The initial timeline for the project has been set at three months.

On its [website](ea-watch.org/en/das-projekt/about-us/), the group writes:

> We feel responsible, and no longer wish to sit idly by while people continue
> to suffer and die.

Sea Watch also [promotes ](ea-watch.org/en/das-projekt/about-us/)a culture of
‘hospitality’, of the kind preached by EU politicians but subjugated to a
policy of exclusion in practice:

> We've decided to fight for the humanisation of politics. Hospitality should
> be a part of our everyday lives once more. A civil maritime rescue service
> must be set up urgently, and the EU is unwilling. That's why we're seizing
> the initiative.

The implementation of the project will begin mid-May. A crew of 4-8 people
will sail to the maritime area north-west of the coast of Libya and carry out
a 12-day observation.

If they see a refugee boat in distress, the organisation will inform the
relevant authorities and provide first aid, drinking water and food, as well
as medical help including life rafts and life jackets if required. In
compliance with [the
recommendations](http://www.proasyl.de/fileadmin/proasyl/fm_redakteure/Broschueren_pdf/Fluechtlinge_in_Seenot_-
_Handeln_und_Helfen_11-06-03.pdf) of the ProAsyl organisation, a pro-asylum
NGO in Germany, the group does not take victims onto their boats.

Sea Watch also maintains an emergency telephone line in order to convey
information about emergencies to national coastguards.

**Mapping the Med**

Sea Watch works closely with [Watch The Med](http://www.watchthemed.net/),
another private initiative founded in 2012. The group has evolved into a large
network made up of activists, researchers, refugee organisations and
seafarers, who document accidents together with the number of dead and injured
refugees in the Mediterranean area using mapping technology. By using mobile
phone data, wind and current analysis, and eyewitness reports, the exact
position of the boats and accidents can be documented in order to subsequently
determine who is responsible for violating international law and the rights of
migrants on the high seas.

At the centre of the project is mapping technology, which creates an overview
of when and where an incident took place and how many refugees were involved.
However, the maps also depict how many refugees can be saved, meaning that a
user could, for example, see that Watch the Med received a call by satellite
phone on [April 11
](http://www.watchthemed.net/index.php/reports/view/105)from a refugee boat
with almost 1000 passengers off the Libyan coast. These refugees could then be
saved after a request for assistance is passed on to the relevant authorities.

In an [interview](http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/-Verlieren-wir-die-
Verbindung--hoffen-wir--15447907) with Swiss online portal 20Minuten, Simon
Sontowski, trained on the emergency telephone by Watch the Med in Zurich,
spoke about his motivations for participating in the initiative:

> Because I can do something practical. Watch the Med is a real lifeline
> within a political and human tragedy. Everyone agrees that it's terrible
> that so many people die each year, but the phrases “Our hands are tied” or
> “What can we do about it” often come up in this context. And it's just not
> right. Of course, we can't save them all – nor do we aim to. But we can help
> to ease the pressure slightly, and with this project, we want to draw
> attention to the fact that it shouldn't be our aim – but that of the EU.
