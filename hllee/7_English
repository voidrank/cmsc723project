New drone footage provides a rare [aerial
view](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2015/11/26/drone-flights-over-
the-plain-of-jars/) of the mysterious Plain of Jars in north Laos.

The Xieng Khouang province is home to more than 2,000 stone jars that are
[believed](http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2008%2F12%2F7%2Flifefocus%2F2713686)
to be 2,000 years old. Most scholars think the jars are mortuary urns left
behind by an unknown civilization. The archaeological site is relevant and
unique in Southeast Asia, but it remains mostly unexplored because it is
littered with unexploded deadly bombs dropped by the Americans during the
Vietnam War era.

Laos, a neighbor of Vietnam, became the most heavily bombed country in the
world during the Vietnam War. An estimated 2 million bombs were
[dropped](https://globalvoices.org/2014/04/09/video-shows-how-the-u-s-
dropped-2-5-million-tons-of-bombs-on-laos/) on Laos between 1964 to 1973, but
about 30 percent failed to detonate. These unexploded bombs continue to injure
and kill Laotian farmers today.

The Plain of Jars is among the many provinces in Laos littered with landmines
and bombs, preventing archaeologists from studying the mysterious artifacts.

The Southeast Asian Archaeology Newsblog
[explains](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2008/12/09/laos-
mysterious-jars-to-aim-for-world-heritage-nomination-by-2011/) the importance
of the jars and why scientists are unable to conduct a deeper investigation of
the archaeological site:

> The mysterious plain of jars in Northeastern Laos is still one of the
> biggest uninvestigated archaeological sites in Southeast Asia—largely
> uninvestigated because of the huge amount of cluster bombs dropped there by
> US forces 40 years ago. From what little that has been investigated, it
> seems that the jars were places of transition in the funerary rite where
> bodies were left to decompose before going through a final burial.

Now, however, thanks to advances in technology, drones can bring us aerial
footage of a landscape made too dangerous for people. This three-minute
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWVEeA4FXY) gives a glimpse of Laos’
enigmatic archaeological site. The video also shows several bomb craters and
trenches—sad relics from the Vietnam War:

Hopefully, this will create more awareness about the jars and lead to better
conservation efforts. As scholar Lia Genovese noted, there are several
[challenges](http://ghn.globalheritagefund.com/uploads/documents/document_2006.pdf)
facing efforts to preserve the jars:

> …conservation efforts are being largely hampered by other factors, such as
> rapid urbanization, farming activities, looting and neglect.
