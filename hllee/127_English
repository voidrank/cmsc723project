The Iranian rial hit a record low on Tuesday October 2, 2012, yet Iranian
authorities appear confused and powerless face to this financial tsunami.
[Sanctions](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/01/23/iran-sanctions-bite-and-
the-iranian-currency-falls/) are being blamed for the national currency's
[drop to](http://www.boston.com/news/world/middle-east/2012/10/02/iran-
lawmakers-seek-answers-over-currency-drop/oCTvDD6Drd0Ptq5WoM26dO/story.html)
34,500 rials against the United States dollar. Only a few days earlier, on
Sunday, it was 29,500 rials to the dollar.

Iranian lawmakers [have signed](http://www.boston.com/news/world/middle-
east/2012/10/02/iran-lawmakers-seek-answers-over-currency-
drop/oCTvDD6Drd0Ptq5WoM26dO/story.html) a petition to summon President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad to parliament for questioning over the rapid drop in value of the
country’s currency.

Meanwhile, the president of Tehran's Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines
and Agriculture, Yahya Al Eshagh,

financial crisis to a war and said “a missile had hit currency square.” In
turn, the Iranian president
[defended](http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=286331) his
government's economic policies, claiming the country's enemies were waging
“psychological warfare” against Iran.

On Wednesday, October 3, Tehran's Bazaar [went on
strike](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/10/03/tehrans-bazaar-goes-on-
strike-as-irans-currency-collapses/) as merchants and shopkeepers protested
the free fall of the currency.

**Ahmadinejad denied the rise of the dollar**

Several netizens shared Ahmadineajd's interview from September 2012, calling
predications that the dollar would rise to 30,000 rials, just an example of
psychological warfare.

**Will the regime collapse?**

Iranian blogger Azark [says](http://azarakan.blogspot.ca/2012/10/blog-
post.html) [fa]:

> The rial continues depreciate in value compared to foreign currencies, hour
> by hour, an unprecedented crisis… One faction within parliament accuses
> Ahmadinejad of being involved in this crisis, while the government's

> Most analysts consider that sanctions against Iran's nuclear program led to

Darzarehbin [writes](http://darazarehbin.blogspot.ca/2012/09/blog-

news: “Iranian central bank invites people to exchange one dollar to 30
billion rials”.

The blogger also [writes](http://darazarehbin.blogspot.ca/2012/10/blog-

Meanwhole Iranians struggle more and more in their daily life as the rial
sinks for sanctions. It seems Iranians have become serial victims of the
regime's repression and the sanctions of world powers.
