The 1929 stock market crash produced an economic crisis that put millions of
people in financial straits. The economic collapse meant large-scale job loss,
and consequently, misery for millions of families. The situation became the
perfect storm for the rise of fascist movements, which [came to power in
Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#germany) [en] and
Italy, and whose sinister effects we all know well.

Plagued by one of the worst economic crises in recent history, fascist parties
are once again on the rise in 21st-century Europe. Flourishing parties are
preying on the social discontent felt within the quintessential welfare states
as citizens are being striped of rights that took generations to win. As
stated in the [European Antifascist
Manifesto](http://antifascismeuropa.org/manifiesto/en) [en]:

Extreme right political parties have been gradually appearing across Europe in
recent years. Belgium's [Vlaams
Blok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Blok), created in the 1970s and
previously outlawed, has recently resurfaced as [Vlams
Belang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang). France's [National
Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_\(France\)), founded in
1972, has emerged as the country's most viable third party option in recent
presidential elections. In Norway, the [Progress
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Party_\(Norway\)) received more
than 22% of the vote in the 2009 elections. [Anders
Breivik](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik), convicted of
the [Utoya Island attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks),
spent several years climbing the Party's ranks.

In Switzerland, the [Swiss People's
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_People's_Party) pulled 29% of the
votes in the 2007 elections. When the [Austrian Freedom
Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria) entered the
country's government in 1999, European Union (EU) member states were forced to
file sanctions against its neighboring alpine republic. Similar examples can
be found in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Holland, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and
Greece, all of which have extreme right parties that hold parliamentary
representation.

In other countries, like Spain, such parties have not succeeded in entering
the lower houses of government, but they have made their way into other
institutions. In the last municipal elections, the [Catalonia Platform Party
(PxC)](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/29/spain-racism-and-intolerance-
advance-relentlessly/) secured 67 spots in varying munincipalities within
Catalonia. The following video, posted by
[alpujarradelasierra](http://www.youtube.com/user/alpujarradelasierra?feature=watch)
on YouTube, is from PxC's recent campaign and unequivacally expresses their
political stances:

The aforementioned political parties share similar ideological premises. All
are profoundly Eurosceptic, hostile towards immigrants and minorities, and
purport doctrines of racism and radical nationalism, to name a few. They also
support populist rhetoric, proposing simple solutions- which are only simple
in appearance- and are often contrary to human rights.

Arguably the most well known Eurosceptic party is the [UK Independence
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party), UKIP, who
according to the blog [Territorio
Europa](http://blogeuropeo.eu/2012/05/22/quien-es-nigel-farage-y-que-
defiende/) [es]- amongst others- promotes the following:

>   * Withdrawal from the EU and regulate the movement of people and workers.
>   * Terminate the open border policy and re-establish visa regulated
> entrances (Europeans to be included).
>   * Repeal the country's Human Rights Act adopted in 1998 and withdrawal
> membership to the European Convention on Human Rights
>   * Dismiss the ability of a UK citizen to appeal to a European or
> International court in defense of one's rights.

The mass influx of immigrants during the economic boom, which has worsened
current employment figures, has spurred ultraright parties’ racism and
xenophobia largely directed towards the Muslim community. They have used the
[emergence of radical Islam in
Europe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_aydtpXQig)\- perceived by many
Europeans as a threat to western values- to incite hate and win votes. The
blog [Territoires de la Memoire](http://www.territoires-
memoire.be/am33/410-le-vlaams-belang-et-lislam-en-francais-dans-le-texte) [fr]
summarizes some of Vlaams Belang's stances:

Minorities are also subject to the affronts of these ultraright groups. The
Hungarian party Jobbik that made lists of [ “dangerous” Jews in the
country](https://es.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/12/11/hungria-se-une-contra-
el-fascismo/), the animosity showed to Roma by the [National
Front](http://www.melty.fr/marine-le-pen-objectif-zero-campement-de-roms-en-
france-a175495.html) [fr] in France and the [Attack
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_\(political_party\)) in
[Bulgaria](http://www.dontsaygypsy.com/?p=781) are prime examples of these
groups’ ideologies.

Greece's Golden Dawn party is but another example as its activists have been
the culprits in a number of recent [attacks on migrants
workers](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/06/01/greece-neo-nazi-golden-
dawn-supporters-attack-more-immigrants/) and whose spokesperson left little
doubt on the group's ideological beliefs after attacking two female
politicians in a televised debate which was posted to the
[RussiaToday](http://m.youtube.com/user/RussiaToday) YouTube channel:
