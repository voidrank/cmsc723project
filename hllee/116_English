Syeda Mehzar Zahra is one of the youngest victims of the ongoing assault on
Shia Muslims by terrorists and extremists organizations in Pakistan. The 12
year-old girl – [who has been called Pakistan's Anna
Frank](http://criticalppp.com/archives/231901) – was shot while her father,
Syed Nazar Abbas, was taking her to school.

[It was the morning of
November](http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C12%5C09%5Cstory_9-12-2012_pg3_5)
30, 2012 when bullets were fired at their car [reportedly by the radical-
sectarian militant](http://en.shiapost.com/2012/11/30/2-more-killed-2-injured-
in-karachi/) organization [Sipah-e-Sahaba
Pakistan.](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/terroristoutfits/Ssp.htm)
Her father died on the spot and Mehzar survived with severe bullet wounds.

Mehzar Zahra was rushed to the doctors, and now she is battling for her life
at a local hospital in Karachi.

Ali Mehdi tweets:

It was unfortunate that Pakistan's broadcast media did not make this a
trending story. This important issue was not even discussed in the days
following the horrendous attack. Many twitter users were upset and shocked by
the silence from the broadcast media (as well as print media) about the
incident:

Yusra Askari tweets:

> [@YusraSAskari](https://twitter.com/YusraSAskari/status/277863760880869376):
> Where are the media and the so-called civil society and human rights

> [#Mehzar](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Mehzar&src=hash) [
> #ShiaGenocide](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ShiaGenocide&src=hash)

Also, social activism for Mehzar was close to zero when compared with the
world-wide support Malala's shooting managed to gain. (See this [Global Voices
Report](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/10/11/pakistan-religious-
extremists-attack-malala-yousufzai/) ) from October.

Mahwish Raza complains:

It was mostly prayers and sighs that were registered at twitter. That's simply
what can be done if terrorists are running free without being punished.

Recently, President of Pakistan, Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, traveled to visit
Malala, who is currently under treatment in an UK hospital. A similar
presidential visit was demanded for Mehzar Zahra in Karachi.

Abdul Nishapuri tweets:

[Ali Natiq and Ali Abbas Taj started a new
hashtag](http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/2012/12/121203_social_media_minority_.shtml)[ur]
called [#iammehzer](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IAmMehzar&src=hash).
Unfortunately, it could not become a “buzz word” in the community. Only [113
people](http://hashtagbattle.com/#battle/m/%23iammehzar/%23mehzar) shared it
across the community this month.

Shia muslims make up about [10% to
15%](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Orphan_Migrated_Content/Muslimpopulation.pdf)
[pdf] of Pakistan's total population. While sectarian violence is a
longstanding problem in Pakistan, attacks against Shia muslims have increased
in recent years. According to the Human Rights Watch, in 2012, at least [320
members](http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/05/pakistan-shia-killings-escalate)
of the Shia population in Pakistan were killed in targeted attacks.

[Brad Adams](http://www.hrw.org/bios/brad-adams), the Asia director at Human
Rights Watch recently said:

> Deadly attacks on Shia communities across Pakistan are escalating. The
> government’s persistent failure to apprehend attackers or prosecute the
> extremist groups organizing the attacks suggests that it is indifferent to
> this carnage.
