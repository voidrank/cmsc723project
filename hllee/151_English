The capital of troubled Balochistan, Quetta was closed on Saturday 14 and
Sunday 15, 2012. This time the call for protest was not given by the Baloch
separatists but by the minority Shia Hazara community.

In the recent past, [targeted violence against the Hazara
community](http://dawn.com/2012/04/14/firing-in-quetta-kills-seven-injures-
one/) in Balochistan has increased. In the last 9 days, [30 Hazaras have been
killed](http://hazaranewspakistan.wordpress.com/). Banned sectarian militant
group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has [taken
responsibility](http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-
english-online/national/15-Apr-2012/hazaras-massacre-continues) for the latest
attack. Last year Lashkar-e-Jhangvi [distributed
pamphlets](http://hazaranewspakistan.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/lashkar-e-
jhangvis-open-letter-against-hazaras/) threatening Hazaras to leave Pakistan
by 2012.

[Hazara People blog](http://www.hazarapeople.com/2012/04/10/systematic-

Why aren’t the authorities taking action against the militant groups who are
openly attacking the Hazara community? Journalist and blogger [Amir
Saeed](http://guppu.com/2012/04/03/genocide-of-hazaras/) answers the question
at Guppu.com in this way:

> Baluchistan is bleeding. The massacre of Hazara community continues with

> in the corridors of power – both at federal and provincial level. Perhaps,
> it is not on agenda of political bigwigs to speak for the community and do
> something viable to protect them from extremists and bigots having a field
> day in the province. The role of security agencies is also dubious but
> ‘fortunately’ they operate under civil authority.

Baloch journalist and blogger [Malik Siraj Akbar](
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malik-siraj-akbar/in-pakistan-hazara-
punished_b_1394135.html) also points finger at the Pakistani authorities for
not taking action against Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.

Rafia Zakaria in [her column](http://dawn.com/2012/04/11/saving-the-hazara/)
calls it a dark Spring for Hazaras. They are caught between the fire and the
frying pan as the International community only knows the Baloch separatist
movement.

Topics like #ShiaGenocide, #Hazara and #Quetta were trending on Twitter in
Pakistan on Saturday. The main discussions were focused on whether to call the
events ‘Shia Killings’ or ‘Hazara killings’.

Many condemned the killings and accused the right wing Sunni religious groups:

> [@alisalmanalvi (Ali Salman Alvi)](http://twitter.com/#!/alisalmanalvi):
> Atrocities on Shia Muslims are not restricted to a specific locality.
> Mosques are spewing venom against Shias, Ahmadis & other minorities.

Leading Hazara activist M. Saleem Javed tweeted:

There were country wide protests by the Hazara community over the weekend but
mainstream TV channels and radio didn’t touch the issue extensively. There was
hardly any participation from other groups of the society.
