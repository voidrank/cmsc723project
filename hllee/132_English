‘Islam is a cancer’, says United States (US) filmmaker [Sam
Bacile](http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/374078/), the man responsible
for sparking outrage amongst the Muslims of the Middle East. The 13 minute
trailer of his movie ‘The Innocence of Muslims’ was recently released to the
social networking website YouTube. The movie is said to be strongly anti-
Islamic, and in his own words, Bacile said he intended his film to be a
provocative political statement [condemning the
religion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/nakoula-basseley-nakoula-
anti-islam-film_n_1879195.html).

The movie, also dubbed in Egyptian Arabic, came under much scrutiny causing an
instant backlash which lead to the [deaths of the US Ambassador to Libya
Christopher Stevens](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/12/arab-world-
outrage-over-killing-of-us-ambassador-in-benghazi-attack/) and his three
aides. [Violent protests](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/meast/egpyt-
us-embassy-protests/index.html) were held outside the American embassy in
Cairo, Egypt where people scaled the Embassy’s walls and tried to burn the
American flag.

Things took a turn for the worse when protestors in neighbouring Libya
followed suit, and attacked the US Consulate. The furious mob set the embassy
in Benghazi on fire. There were also reports of [rocket propelled
grenades](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201780/Christopher-Stevens-
death-US-ambassador-killed-attack-Libya.html) being used.

The attack saw the deaths of US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and
his three aides due to smoke asphyxiation. People across the globe took to
social media websites to voice opinions about the attacks and pay tribute to
the late Ambassador. The reactions in the Pakistan Twittersphere however were
mixed.

The US filmmaker Sam Bacile has reportedly [gone into
hiding](http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/374078/) from where he spoke
to the media via telephone. Claiming to be an Israeli Jew, hoping to bring out
the truth behind Islam, Bacile believes his movie will help his native land,
Israel. Israeli officials however say they have no record of Bacile being a
citizen.

While Bacile [said](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/chris-stevens-us-
libya-ambassador-killed-142949456.html?_esi=1) he was apologetic over the
deaths caused because of his movie, he said the security at the embassy was
not enough to stand up against the radical ‘Islamists’.

After the director’s disappearance, speculations about his existence have now
taken centre stage. Whether he is a real person, or a pseudo identity remains
to be seen. Amidst the controversy, a man name [Steven Klein has come
forward](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muhammad-
film-consultant-sam-bacile-is-not-israeli-and-not-a-real-name/262290/), who
calls himself a ‘self-described militant Christian activist’.

According to Klein, Bacile came to him for help on his movie and confided in
him because of Klein’s frequent anti-Islamic protests in front of mosques and
schools in California after the 9/11 attacks.

> After 9/11 I went out to look for terror cells in California and found them,
> piece of cake. Sam (Bacile) found out about me. The Middle East Christian
> and Jewish communities trust me.

Klein denies that the filmmaker is an Israeli or Jewish. Pakistanis on twitter
have their suspicions as well:

Prior to this incident, the movie ‘The Innocence of Muslims’ was [played once
in a Hollywood theatre](http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/374078/)
earlier this year. The turnout was not impressive.
