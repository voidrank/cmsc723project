Leading digital rights advocates and bloggers [Markus
Beckedahl](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Beckedahl) and [Andre
Meister](https://netzpolitik.org/author/andre/), along with an “unknown
party,” are being investigated for treason for allegedly having leaked
documents detailing Germany's plans to expand domestic Internet surveillance
earlier this year.

The bloggers received an official letter from Germany's Federal Attorney
General informing them that he had “initiated a criminal investigation on
suspicion of treason against [the accused] on the basis of §§ 94 Abs. 1 Nr. 2,
25 Abs. 2, 53 German Criminal Code, due to criminal charges by the Federal
Office for Protection of the Constitution.”

Netzpolitik.org is a critical german investigative blog with more than 30
authors who report mainly on issues concerning Internet surveillance and
privacy since 2004. The website was awarded with the well-known [Grimme Online
Award ](http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1908#c12846)in 2014.
Beckedahl is also a founding director of the popular annual [Re:Publica
conference in Berlin](https://re-publica.de/en), which focuses on digital
rights and culture.

On their website, netzpolitik.org
[announced](https://netzpolitik.org/2015/suspicion-of-treason-federal-
attorney-general-announces-investigation-against-us-in-addition-to-our-
sources/):

> Today, we received a letter from the Federal Attorney General of Germany
> confirming ongoing investigations against our reporters Markus Beckedahl,
> Andre Meister and an “unknown” source, suspecting us of treason according to
> the [German Penal Code](http://www.gesetze-im-
> internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0973).

In their statement, netzpolitik.org condemned the investigations as an attack
on press freedom:

> From the very beginning, the charges against our alleged source(s) were
> politically motivated and targeted to crush the necessary public debate
> about internet surveillance Post-Snowden. Whistleblowers in the public
> interest need protection, not prosecution for “treason”. Investigating the
> acclaimed media outlet netzpolitik.org as accomplices in treason charges is
> a direct attack on freedom of the press, which we thought was outlawed with
> the Constitutional Court ruling in the Cicero case 2007.

The last time such charges were brought against a journalist in Germany was in
1962, when the [editor-in-chief of Der Spiegel was accused of
treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegel_scandal) for publishing secret
documents about the German defense forces.

The netzpolitik.org bloggers have stated clearly that they will not be
intimidated by the investigations and that their independent and critical
journalism will continue:

> The Federal Attorney General needs to drop the investigations against us and
> our alleged source(s) and instead investigate and charge the out-of-control
> secret services that are expanding their mass surveillance without public
> debate.

The investigation of netzpolitik.org has led to an uproar in mainstream and
social media. #Landesverrat (#treason) immediately trended in Germany with
many users expressing concern about the investigations.

The investigation was also sharply criticized by the [German Press
Association. ](http://www.djv.de/startseite/profil/der-djv/pressebereich-
download/pressemitteilungen/detail/article/justizposse-gegen-
journalisten.html)Michael Konken, Chairman of the German Journalists
Association stated: “The investigations against the two journalists show, that
the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has not learnt
anything concerning freedom of speech,” arguing that bloggers had simply
delivered the information that is in the public interest and that the public
is entitled to know. He has urged the Federal Attorney General to stop the
investigation immediately.
