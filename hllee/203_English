Yesterday, 17 May, 2011, a suicide bomber exploded himself at the entrance to
the regional office of the National Security Committee in Aktobe, a provincial
center in Western Kazakhstan. Four people were injured in the blast.

This is the first case of suicide bombing in Kazakhstan, a country known for
its inter-ethnic tolerance and for boasting its stability in the uneasy region
of Central Asia. Extremists have allegedly been trying to penetrate the
country, and occasionally the Kazakh authorities report on arrests of criminal
groups that are close to religious extremist groups, like Hizb-ut-Takhrir, and
non-traditional Islam groupings.

the authorities for employing the “police socialism” model in politics, i.e.
the tactics of distracting the society's attention from political fight via
institutions, controlled by the state:

> [The government] was warned many times not to play with this, but they never
> listened, and now they get the first suicide bomber […] Isn't that cool. Why
> didn't the authorities start checking the imams [Islamic leaders] 10 years
> ago and stop flirting with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia? Now we don't have
> enough balls to run a full-scale counter-terror [campaign]

“Aktobe is horrified. Apparently, the officer on duty did not let the bomber
to enter the building and the blast burst at the entrance. The city is
agitated, police cordons everywhere”, _[danik-

A spokesman for the General Prosecutor's office
[told](http://thenews.kz/2011/05/17/821036.html) [ru] at the news conference
that “Makhatov, suspected of committing several offenses as part of organized
criminal group, blew himself up with the purpose to evade the liability”.
