All that remains of 44 homes in Zafer 4, Gaza. Taken by @dancohen3000

Pro-Palestine activists have begun ‘re-naming’ Israel as the Jewish State of
Israel in the Levant, or
[JSIL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JSIL&src=typd), in an obvious satirical
allusion to the neighboring self-proclaimed ISIS, a splinter group of Al Qaeda
that has brutally taken over swathes of Syria and Iraq, mowing residents and
particularly minorities in its path.

This was meant to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
speech at the United Nations, a man they're calling the ‘Supreme Leader’ of
JSIL. It comes nearly a month after a [ceasefire was
reached](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/27/ceasefire-peace-deal-
israel-hamas-gaza-50-days-of-war-and-damage/) in Gaza following the 50-day
offensive, which killed at least 2,137 Palestinians, a majority of whom were
civilians, including 577 children, and wounded at least 10,870 others. The
attack has also had a noticeable effect on Gaza's economy, with hardly any
civilian infrastructure left untouched: over 18,000 [homes
destroyed](http://rt.com/op-edge/185524-un-gaza-damage-refugees/), as well as
over 100 schools, 50 health-care centers and 17 hospitals damaged or 20
destroyed.

Led by known supporters of the Palestinian cause, the re-naming movement is
using the same language ascribed to ISIS by the mainstream media to describe
the Israeli government's policies. Independent journalist [Rania
Khalek](https://twitter.com/RaniaKhalek), for example, warns of the threat
posed by ‘JSIL’ to the Western world:

> We have to stop [#JSIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSIL?src=hash) before
> its tactics migrate to our shores. Some already have!
> <http://t.co/izAxuopZKj> <http://t.co/VGdTVbiNcF>
>

She also compared the financial and military aid given by the United States to
Israel to the ISIS's “Jizya tax” — a tax imposed on those they consider to be
non-believers:

> [#JSIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSIL?src=hash) has already imposed its
> jizya on American taxpayers forced to pay $3.1 billion/year to Israel in
> military aid. Scary stuff.

Another similarity are the executions committed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza.
Journalist Rania Khalek tweeted an excerpt from Jewish-American journalist and
blogger Max Blumenthal [recalling for the Russell
Tribunal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWrOuGNrzZc&list=PLBDtcbghfMdsKkGO9MFG5MPxC3s8gyGES),
or the [International War Crimes
Tribunal](http://www.russelltribunalonpalestine.com/en/), what two
International Committee of the Red Cross said they found in the [Gazan town of
Khuza'a](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/07/25/gaza-survivors-twitter-
timeline-reveals-the-slow-horror-of-khuzaas-massacre/):

The tribunal [concluded](http://hummusforthought.com/2014/09/25/russell-
tribunal-on-palestine/) that evidence showed Israeli forces had committed war
crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of murder, extermination and
persecution, and incitement to genocide during the offensive.

Gaza-based American journalist [Joe Catron](https://twitter.com/jncatron)
pointed out how ‘JSIL’ also recruits foreign fighters — most of whom end up
leading the country:

Joseph from the ‘[ALeftwingBlog](http://aleftwingblog.wordpress.com)‘ wondered
about the ways in which the Jewish community could fight extremists, spoofing
the pressure put on the world's Muslims to [condemn or
apologize](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/10/01/should-muslims-apologize-
for-isis-atrocities/) for ISIS:

> What can the Jewish community do 2 strengthen the moderates? How can we

Of notable and symbolic importance is the number of Jewish activists taking
the lead in calling Israel ‘JSIL’ wishing to challenge the Zionist narrative
of speaking for all Jews around the world. Gaza-based American journalist [Dan
Cohen](https://twitter.com/dancohen3000) recalls the Zionist recruitment
agencies that visited him in his synagogue as a child:

> Growing up Jewish in America,
> [#JSIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSIL?src=hash) infiltrated my synagogue
> and actively recruits from my community to kill for its expansionist aims.

To which [Max Blumenthal](https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal) responded by
accusing Taglit, the ‘birthright’ agency that organizes trips to Israel for
young Jewish adults around the world, of being a sectarian training program:

> .[@dancohen3000](https://twitter.com/dancohen3000)
> [#JSIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSIL?src=hash)‘s private donors paid to
> send me and 1000's of others to be indoctrinated in a sectarian training
> program called Taglit

Dan Cohen and Max Blumenthal were both in Gaza during the latest Israeli
aggression and [described the scenes of horror they saw
there](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/16/journalists-visit-gaza-tweet-
images-of-a-devastated-city/). Both Cohen and Blumenthal lead the naming
movement on Twitter, citing comparisons between ISIS and ‘JSIL’ policies:

> I missed Supreme Leader of JSIL Netanyahu's speech but I assume it involved
> a lot of sophistry to defend the indefensible.

They also accused ‘JSIL’ of using the Holocaust for its own political gain,
echoing [the
letter](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/08/23/over-300-holocaust-
survivors-and-their-descendants-condemn-israels-massacre-of-palestinians-in-
gaza/) that was released by Holocaust survivors in August:

> .[@MaxBlumenthal](https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal)
> [#JSIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSIL?src=hash) exploits the slaughter of
> my grandmother's family to provide cover for similar crimes against

> 2014](https://twitter.com/dancohen3000/status/516697310827675650)

Finally, Blumenthal and Khalek summarized the point of the naming campaign
with the following tweets:

> [#ISIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISIL?src=hash) falsely claims to embody
> the true Islam, inspiring Islamophobia.
> [#JSIL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JSIL?src=hash) falsely claims to
> represent all Jews, inspiring anti-Semitism.
