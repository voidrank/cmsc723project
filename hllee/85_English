Coptic churches and businesses were attacked across Egypt today [August 14] by
what was described as Muslim Brotherhood members and their supporters. The
sectarian attacks followed the [violent evacuation of Pro-Morsi sit-ins](
https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/08/14/conflicting-casualty-reports-as-
muslim-brotherhood-sit-ins-dispersed-in-egypt/) in the capital Cairo, in which
many Egyptians were killed and injured.

On social media, many suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood has been fanning
the flames of sectarianism, pitting Muslim against Christian, resulting in
today's unprecedented wide-scale attacks.

The two sit-ins were for the supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi, a
senior Muslim Brotherhood member, whose one-year reign was cut short on July
3, following massive protests calling for him to resign and for early
elections.

For weeks, Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood supporters have been camping in Rabaa
Al Adawiya, in Nasr City, and in Al Nahda Square, near Cairo University,
calling for the return to “legitimacy” or reinstating Morsi as the legally
elected president of Egypt.

In addition to churches, Coptic business interests were also attacked today.

With all the death and destruction, today remains a black day in Egypt's
history. Yossra Farghaly sums up this sentiment with remorse:
