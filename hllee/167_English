Shock and awe awaited Greek citizens on Monday January 23, 2012, when Louka
Katseli, former minister of labour and social security (2010) and minister of
economy, competitiveness and shipping (2009), revealed that she had had only
three hours to read the [IMF
memorandum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Greek_protests)
tackling the country's debt crisis.

Michalis Chrysochoidis, current minister for development, competitiveness and
shipping and former minister of citizen protection, admitted [on a morning
television show](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xnyo7l) interview [el] that
he signed the IMF memorandum without having read it at all, arguing that
“simply, he had other obligations during that time, as he was fighting against
crime”:

News spread quickly on the web reacting to the remarks, including extremely
negative comments and derogatory insults from netizens, expressing their
disdain for the political system, and mocking the minister's excuse.

Within one to two hours, the case became a [world trending
topic](http://twitpic.com/8b30h3) via the Twitter hashtag
[#de_diavasa_to_mnimonio_giati](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23De_diavasa_to_mnimonio_giati)
(I didn't read the memorandum because…):

Since it wasn't your job to study the memorandum and the laws, why were you a

Twitter user @mirsiniloizou posted: "and here, the photo of
#didn't_read_memorandum_because". Photo shows "protagonists of the day" Ms.
Katseli and Mr. Chrysochoidis.

After the intense criticism, Chrysochoidis published the following Facebook
status update (original text in Greek
[here](https://www.facebook.com/chrisochoidis/posts/10150536152082954)):

During last year, the government and members of parliament have been the
target of heavy criticism for their acceptance of the IMF memorandum and their
inaction against the socio-economic crisis of the country, which has urged
many of them to defend their beliefs and political actions.

Another “disclaimer statement” was made on October 2011 by former PASOK MP
Thomas Rompopoulos, who [argued ](http://youtu.be/HcZnyK2GdBA)[el] during a
radio show broadcast: “Nobody had the time to read the Memorandum, neither I
did nor anybody did; We authorized [Minister for Economy at the time]
Papakonstantinou to sign for it. It was a matter of trust”:

In addition to the bold accusations Minister Chrysochoidis himself received,
many netizens via social media have also criticized the general political
scene, but also the “blindness” of they themselves, who have been conniving
with the politicians’ foul actions:

> [Panagiotis Giannoudis](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1726015587):
> Ζήτω η Βουλή των Ελλήνων!

[Panagiotis Giannoudis](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1726015587):
Hooray to the Greek Parliament!

[dangler69](http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/192569/m-hrusohoidis-den-
diavasa-to-mnimonio/): Finally, did anyone at least read it? Maybe those who
were removed from the Parliament.

[@MilitaryRaiden](https://twitter.com/#!/MilitaryRaiden/status/161712771585679360):
Everybody is surprised by Chrysochoidis’ confession of impotence, but not by
the fact that the stupid ones that elected him still hold their voting rights.

at MPs’ offices. They are printing the memorandum.

never read user manuals

Finally, during the following day, user Arkoudos concludes bitterly,
reflecting the saddest part of Greek economical and social crisis [el]:
