The US President Barack Obama is in India now as part of his ten day Asia tour
and he has generated a lot of interest in this country of 1.2 billion people.
The Indian media got hyped up covering every bit of Obama's action in India
and the netizens are also vocal about it. _Hanna Ingber Win_ , a Global Post
correspondent from Mumbai,

the enthusiasm of the Indians:

Obamas are being treated in India:

From New Delhi research analyst and blogger _Varun Dixit_
[questions](http://dixitvarun.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-is-barack-obama-in-
india.html) “why is Barack Obama in India” and comments:

> Obama is trying to bring back jobs in US, which he couldn't succeed so far
> and I am sure will not be able to succeed in future also. Wall Street knows
> setting their operations in India will help them in long term whereas Obama
> is just playing politics by promising to US people what he cannot do.

Indians were also very much interested to know Mr. Obama's stance on Pakistan
and he somewhat startled many by his speech as [Ghulam
Muhammed](http://www.ghulammuhammed.blogspot.com/2010/11/obamas-pak-bombshell-
hits-india-by.html) from Mumbai explains:

> He (Obama) said, it is in India’s best interest that its neighbor Pakistan
> should become a peaceful and stable country, so that India’s own progress
> towards a future of economic growth and prosperity can be assured of a
> steady and peaceful progression. Commentators on all English Channels
> exploded with open hostility while the speech was still on. Hawks like Times
> of India’s Washington correspondent termed it as giving in to Pakistan
> blackmail.

Khamba's hilarious take titled “[Things Obama will never say in
India](http://www.gkhamba.com/2010/11/things-obama-will-never-say-in-
india.html) ” came somewhat true with that speech.

Here are some reactions from the Indian Twitter users:

> [aasthabiyani16](http://twitter.com/aasthabiyani16/status/1345300165828608):
> @ArjunKP Word! Sick of Obama Obama and more Obama, hey Raama come n save me
> from this drama, err that rhymes :p

_Greatbong_ [criticizes](http://greatbong.net/2010/11/06/obamania-enough-
already/) the Obama mania and suggests:

> We should treat Obama’s visit as just another visit by a head of state and
> not take it as a certificate of how much the US respects India. Because it
> does not. Definitely not under Obama.
