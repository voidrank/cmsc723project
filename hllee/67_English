Reports that Syria's chemical weapons stash would be [destroyed in
Albania](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/15/us-syria-crisis-chemical-
idUSBRE9AE0I620131115) have angered Albanians, who took to the streets to
protest the proposal. Following the protests, the Albanian government refused
to host the dismantling of 1,300 metric tons of Syria's sarin, mustard and
other agents.

Online, Albanian netizens made their views heard.
