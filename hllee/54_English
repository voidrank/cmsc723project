It's been nearly seven decades since the former colony of British India was
[split into two countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India)
along religious lines, touching off the largest mass migration in human
history as Muslims migrated to Pakistan while Sikhs, Hindus and others
migrated to India. As many as a million people lost their lives in violence
immediately after the Partition of India.

In the years that followed, conflict over territory and resources has plagued
the two countries’ already rocky relationship. The acrimony often spills over
into the classroom, where hyped-up nationalism offers students a skewed view
of their neighbor.

Lahore-based Pakistani entrepreneur and activist [Qasim
Aslam](http://pk.linkedin.com/in/qasimaslam) along with a [team of young
people from India and Pakistan](http://www.thehistory-project.org/#team) are
taking aim at the biases shaping the youth of these two countries through [The
History Project](http://www.thehistory-project.org/). The method is simple:
[juxtaposing texts from history books taught in the schools of both
countries](http://www.sunday-guardian.com/bookbeat/when-historys-lessons-are-
systematically-forgotten) in order to introduce an alternative, neutral
narrative to the students.

Qasim also serves on the board of Seeds of Peace, an international NGO working
on international conflict resolution. He has initiated several Indo-Pak
exchange programs aimed at promoting understanding at a social level between
the two.

Launched in Mumbai in April 2013, the textbook is now used in several schools
in India and Pakistan. Qasim explained to journalist and blogger [Beena
Sarwar](http://beenasarwar.com/2014/03/06/one-history-two-narratives/):

> The way we are taught history aims to make us into conformists. The History
> Project aims to inculcate a culture of questioning, counter how history is
> taught as a set of facts, not a narrative – which is what it is. A fact
> can’t have two versions.

According to the [preamble of the book](http://www.thehistory-
project.org/pdf/the-history-project.pdf), the idea came about during a meeting
of Pakistani and Indian teenagers in a small town in the US state of Maine.
The main idea, it reads, was:

> to enable access for youth in their formative years to alternative
> perspectives on their shared heritage and to encourage a culture of rational
> and critical thinking with particular focus on information that shapes the
> view of our respective lineage.

In an [interview with news website The
Diplomat](http://thediplomat.com/2013/05/the-history-project-inspiring-indian-
and-pakistani-children-to-rethink-the-past/), team members Qasim, Ayyaz Ahmad
and Zoya Siddiquiand spoke of the evolution of the project, from finding a
direction to realizing the benefit of illustrations.

Online, people have welcomed the idea. Commenting on a profile of the project
in newspaper The Hindu, user [Saurabh
Sethi](http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/one-story-two-
sides/article5124147.ece) wrote:

> Phenomenal effort by both the authors and The Hindu to bring into light  
>  such information.You are an example of the kind of people we need today  
>  to strengthen Indo-Pak relationship.

On Twitter, users praised the project:

The book only covers events [leading up to the Partition of
India](http://thediplomat.com/2013/05/the-history-project-inspiring-indian-
and-pakistani-children-to-rethink-the-past/) in 1947. Perhaps one day it will
delve into the history that comes after. You can follow the project via its
[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/thehistoryproject).
