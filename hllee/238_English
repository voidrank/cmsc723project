In the past week, the Israeli cabinet approved by a 22-8 vote the [proposed
amendment](http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/a-special-place-in-hell/a-special-
place-in-hell-top-10-worst-errors-israel-is-about-to-make-1.318659) to
Israel's Citizenship Law, which would require all those seeking citizenship to
pledge allegiance to Israel as a “Jewish and democratic state.” To become law,
it must pass three Knesset votes in the upcoming months.

Attempts to enforce recognition of Israel as uniquely Jewish have been deeply
controversial, particularly among Israel's Arab citizens, who make up a fifth
of the country's population. Some claim [Bibi Netanyahu is playing straight
into the hands of Avigdor Lieberman](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-
defense/victory-for-israel-s-right-as-jewish-state-loyalty-oath-nears-
vote-1.317565)‘s nationalist party doctrine. Other logic seems to be “we must
demand from ourselves what Israel is asking others to recognize”, referencing
[Israel's request from the
Palestinians](http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE6955MC20101006?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0)
to recognize it as a Jewish nation-state. Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni
condemned the cabinet's approval, describing it as [“politics at its
worst”](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/livni-loyalty-oath-amendment-is-
politics-at-its-worst-1.318219) and “political horse-trading”.

In a blog post about the topic, Orit Kamir
[reminds](http://www.notes.co.il/orit/52775.asp) us that such laws were
previously banned:

> There are Democratic countries that request a loyalty oath from new
> citizens; immigrants asking to receive citizenship. There are countries that
> request new citizens to study their culture, history and language. These are
> fair and desired requests. The State of Israel does not do this, because it
> provides automatic citizenship to Jews, not asking them for anything except
> their religion.

> Historic reminder: In the 80's, Meir Kahana called against the declaration
> of the state, requesting to cancel the section boasting equality (‘a State
> for all its citizens’), to leave only a zionist, religious and non-
> democratic declaration. His party was outlawed, and he was publically
> condemned. What happened that 20 years later we don't see the latent danger
> in precisely this move?

The following [Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=117432431651398) has been
gathering Israelis to rally against the law. Following is an excerpt of a
conversation between Israeli group members and Israeli opponents:

[Dean Michaely](http://www.facebook.com/madean) writes:

[Barak Granot](http://www.facebook.com/barak.granot) adds a sarcastic
response:

> When was the last time that you saw someone blow up or shoot here? Baruch
> Goldstein was a long time ago. Also the Rabbi Uzi Meshulam. Maybe you mean
> the underground crime organizations that blow up cars? Or maybe you're

> But wait… these are all wholly Israeli citizens. So what exactly are you

[Daniel Oz](http://www.facebook.com/moribunny) adds:

> Its Bibi & Lieberman who don't accept Israel as Jewish and Democratic,
> otherwise they wouldn't propose this fascist law, that conveys a lack of
> confidence in Israel's Jewish nature and is, in effect, an attempt to cancel
> the democracy in order to support a national-racial Jewish population.

[Dean](http://www.facebook.com/madean) posts an additional response:

> Barak you are wrong about many things. Israel was given to the Jews and

> And by the way, the proposal passed a democratic vote, just like the

Bradley Burston compiles a list of [things you can
do](http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/a-special-place-in-hell/a-special-place-in-
hell-top-10-worst-errors-israel-is-about-to-make-1.318659) to help prevent the
law:
