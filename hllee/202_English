Demonstrations on the streets of Madrid on May 15 have turned into [big camp
outs all over ](http://bit.ly/l8LaVi)Spain, and across the world. There had
not been any police intervention since the second day of protests in Madrid,
May 17, but on the morning of May 27 Barcelona protesters started sending
messages that they were being evicted. According to the police, it was not an
eviction but an attempt to allow for the cleaning patrols to do their job.
Videos showing police charging against demonstrators have gone viral:

Police reaction has managed to attract more protesters to the camps and it
will likely spark solidarity all over Spain and the rest of the world.
Mobilizations in Spain have ignited what has been called a “World Revolution”,
with more than 600 demonstrations and camp outs taking place in solidarity
with Spanish protesters, as this interactive map shows:

The extent of the movement has exceeded everyone's expectations. Protests in
Spain have turned into something quite different from what the first
demonstrations were. The group [_Democracia Real
Ya_](http://www.democraciarealya.es/) [es] (Real Democracy Now), which
organized the May 15 march, has since dissociated from the camps organization,
whose updates can now be followed through the
[_Tomalaplaza.net_](http://tomalaplaza.net/) [es] (Take the Square) website.
Spanish independent news site [_Periodismo Humano_
](http://periodismohumano.com/destacado/los-primeros-40-de-sol.html)[es]
published on May 26 a report on the first 40 people[
](http://periodismohumano.com/destacado/los-primeros-40-de-sol.html)who
decided to camp out on May 16, which lead to a movement that gathered tens of
thousands and has become global.

Some users have expressed concerns that the camp itself might become the goal:

> [@svillodas](https://twitter.com/#!/svillodas): La gente llenó esta plaza
> para luchar contra un régimen putrefacto, no para aprender a tocar la
> guitarra o hacer disfraces #acampadasol

[@svillodas](https://twitter.com/#!/svillodas): People took this square to
fight a corrupt regime, not to learn how to play guitar and make customs
#acampadasol

To challenge these concerns, protesters published On May 26 [four starting
points](http://madrid.tomalaplaza.net/2011/05/26/acampada-sol-consensua-
cuatro-lineas-de-debate/) [es] that, according to the site, have been agreed
upon by consensus at the latest assembly:

  * Electoral reform oriented to a more representative form of democracy and more effective devices for citizen participation.
  * Rules that ensure political transparency in order to fight corruption
  * Effective separation of public powers
  * Devices for citizen control of political responsibility

What will come next? Protesters have not decided when they will leave the
square, but assemblies are already organized in more than 30 neighbourhoods to
continue discussing several different issues. This will be the second stage of
a movement that is allowing citizens to learn about democratic processes from
their own experience, while attempting to teach main political parties a
lesson in democracy.
