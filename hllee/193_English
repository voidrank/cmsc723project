Protests calling for President Bashar Al Assad “to leave” continue in Syria
this Ramadan. As the death toll mounts, reactions continue to pour in from
across the Arab world.

Syrian activists are keeping their readers updated with developments on the
ground through posting videos and updating social media platforms with the
latest.
