Egypt's Military Police set Cairo's Tahrir Square ablaze and forcefully pushed
away protesters demonstrating outside the Cabinet on the first anniversary of
the Arab revolution, sparked by the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi in
[Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/tunisia-
uprising-201011/). Egypt's netizens are on hand to provide witness accounts of
what is happening on the ground now.

The battle [#OccupyCabinet](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23occupycabinet)
has been raging for two days: eight people have been killed and more than 300
injured as the military attacked protesters who have been camping outside the
Cabinet headquarters in Cairo for the past three weeks, protesting against the
military appointment of Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El Ganzouri as the new
Prime Minister earlier this month.

El Ganzouri just gave a press conference, stressing that the army would not
attack peaceful protesters. Minutes later, a full offensive was waged on the
protesters, pushing them away from the cabinet and clearing and burning Tahrir
Square. Netizens report their witness accounts live on Twitter as I type.
