Less than 24 hours from the re-election of President Obama, news of a new
drone strike hit Yemen. The strike was in the al-Sarin village in Sanhan and
killed Adnan al-Qadhi, Rabeaa Lahib and Radwan al-Hashdhi and injured others,
including a boy. Yet, this strike is different from previous ones because
Sanhan is less than 40km from the capital Sanaa and happens to be the former
president Ali Abdulla Saleh's hometown.

Many Yemeni netizens were alarmed and dismayed. Here are some of their
reactions:

Yemeni activist Ibrahim Mothana tweeted:

Gregory Johnsen, author of forthcoming book The Last Refuge: Yemen al-Qaeda
and America's War in Arabia, tweeted:

In his blog (Waq al Waq) latest [post](http://bigthink.com/waq-al-waq/adnan-
al-qadhi-and-the-day-after) ‘Adnan al-Qadhi and the Day After,’ Johnsen points
out:

> This is important. The US has carried out, by my best estimate, between 37 –
> 50 strikes this year in an attempt to kill 10 – 15 people. Many of those 10
> – 15 people are still alive (see: Nasir al-Wihayshi, Said al-Shihri, Qasim
> al-Raymi, Ibrahim Asiri and so on) but people are dying in Yemen.

Prior to the US election results, Palestinian activist and poet Remi Kanazi
tweeted:

> [@Remroum](https://twitter.com/Remroum/status/265726368011141120): My name
> is Barack Obama and I approve this bombing. #Afghanistan #Pakistan #Yemen

Yemeni Blogger Afrah Nasser sarcastically tweeted:

> We Can #Drone!” #Obama #Yemen #Somalia #Pakistan

Nevertheless, many Arab netizens and not only Yemenis were relieved that Mitt
Romney did not win the elections since many believed he would be more
aggressive in the ‘war on terror’. Yet it seems from the recent strike, Obama
is sending a clear message that his policy in Yemen is not changing. However,
how long can Yemen endure more drones?
