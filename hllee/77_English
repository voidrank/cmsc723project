Some 12 hours after [Bosnia-Herzegovina secured its direct
qualification](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24517475) to the 2014
World Cup in Brazil, Bosnians are still celebrating this historic moment.
Social networks are
[flooded](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bih&src=typd&f=realtime) with
comments of joy from Bosnians and support from other nations.

Last night and today, October 16, 2013, no one can tell by looking at social
networks and regional news sites that Bosnia still has a very troubled
political life, or that the EU is threatening the small Balkan country with
sanctions. The only topic on people's minds and timelines is that of Bosnia-
Herzegovina's 1-0 win over Lithuania in the World Cup qualifiers. Even the
official Twitter account of the [OSCE Mission to Bosnia-
Herzegovina](https://twitter.com/OSCEBiH) dropped all other matters last night
to [announce](https://twitter.com/OSCEBiH/status/390205234170978304) the
team's win:

All across Bosnia-Herzegovina, fans are emotional about their countries
historical placement in the largest sporting event in the world. Twitter user

This win came, almost “miraculously” as some on social networks put it, on the
Kurban Bayrami religious holiday widely celebrated in Bosnia-Herzegovina, also
known throughout the Muslim world as the [feast of
sacrifice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha). Some social media users
gave the traditional Bayrami holiday greeting used to commemorate the end of
Bayram and [Hajj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj) “Bayram Sherif Mubarek
Olsun” (“May the holy Bayram be blessed”) a World Cup twist, and no one seemed
to take offense. On the contrary, tweets like [this
one](https://twitter.com/Nikola_MNE/status/390198739014406144) from [Nikola
Bajčetić](https://twitter.com/Nikola_MNE/) from Montenegro were greeted with
humor and good spirits:

The match seems to have brought the entire troubled region together, as
Serbian, Croatian and Montenegrin fans congratulated Bosnia-Herzegovina and
celebrated the win with them online. After last night's 2-0 loss to Scotland,
[Croatia still has a slim
chance](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/scotland-croatia-
world-cup-qualifier) of qualifying in the playoffs. Serbia, however, lost any
chance of making it through to the World Cup several months ago after possibly
one of the worst qualifying campaigns in its sporting history. But Serbia
[beat Macedonia
5-1](http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/253678/report) on October
15, 2013, thus sinking any dreams Macedonians may have had of reaching Brazil
next summer. Fans from all three countries, amid their own losses, joined in
celebrating Bosnia-Herzegovina's unique win. [Nikola
Radović](https://twitter.com/NowitzkiCt/) from Montenegro joined in by
[saying](https://twitter.com/NowitzkiCt/status/390198677836673024):

Bosnia-Herzegovina's national football team now faces the likes of England,
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and other top teams in Brazil next year and
has an unlikely chance of getting very far in the competition. However, many
say that further results for Bosnia at the World Cup are now irrelevant, as
this is the country's first time to qualify as an independent nation, a
historic moment worth more than any title. The video below shows what Sarajevo
looked like throughout the night as people took to the streets to celebrate:
