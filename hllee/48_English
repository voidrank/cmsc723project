If Russian military exercises on the Ukrainian border, combined with
jingoistic rhetoric from the Russian parliament, weren't enough to worry
about, RuNet bloggers are happy to help!

On April 25, 2014, Aleksandr Sokoloff, who runs a popular military blog on
LiveJournal, published a [post ](http://sokol-
ff.livejournal.com/781796.html)[ru] in which he called attention to
photographs taken at a recent Russian Ministry of Defense meeting. This was
the meeting where Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced the start of the
war games which are making everyone so nervous. Sokoloff wrote that these
photos made him, a “seasoned” person, “flinch.”

Specifically, he was referring to photos of a 78 year old man in military
uniform, Vladimir Lobov, a general who was the last Soviet military Chief of
Staff, and who according to Sokoloff retired in 1994. In his position as Chief
of Staff, wrote Sokoloff, Lobov was in charge of devising strategies for
invasion of Europe, especially ones using large numbers of tanks. Lobov was
also responsible for the oversight of the 1981 Soviet war-games, one of the
largest in history.

Sokoloff's conclusion at seeing Lobov in uniform at a Ministry of Defense
meeting was that the man had come out retirement, which can only mean one
thing:

> Российская Федерация действительно серьёзно готовится к полномасштабной
> войне и это последний намёк Западу, что в случае необратимого развития
> событий речь может пойти не о расчленении Украины по Днепру, а о расчленении
> Европы по Ла-Маншу.

> The Russian Federation is really very seriously preparing for full-scale
> war, and this is the last hint to the West that if the events continue to
> develop the way they do, the end goal might not just be splitting Ukraine at
> the Dnieper, but splitting Europe at the English Channel.

Sokoloff's post gathered over 1,000 comments in the space of a day, most of
them with varying levels of belief and incredulity. It also spread through
VKontakte and Facebook, [reposted [ru]

like the nationalist Sputnik & Pogrom.

Later, Marina Yudenich, a writer with ties to the Kremlin and a popular pro-
government blogger, tried to [reassure ](http://marina-
yudenich.livejournal.com/1124151.html)[ru] her readers. Poking fun at armchair
experts like Sokoloff, she claimed that while Lobov officially retired from
the military 20 years ago, he has stayed on as a “leading analyst” at Russian
Defense Ministry's “Inspector General's” office. As such, he is present at all
large Ministry of Defense meetings, and, as it happens, is always in uniform.

If we take Yudenich's claims of this inside information at face value, perhaps
full-scale war is a bit further from reality than paranoid bloggers would like
their readers to believe.
