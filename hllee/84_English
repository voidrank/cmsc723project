Syrian opposition activists accuse Bashar Al Assad's forces of killing
hundreds of people, mostly children and women, reportedly with nerve gas, in
the Ghouta region, east of Damascus, Syria, on the morning of August, 21,
2013.

Horrible footage of dying (and dead) children are plastered across social
media, calling for the world to break its silence on the atrocities being
committed against civilians in Syria.

On Greater Syria, Enas, a Syrian in Amman, Jordan,
[writes](http://greatersyria.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/massacre-by-chemical-
weaponry-in-eastern-al-ghouta-damascus-2182013/):

> At around 3:00 a.m. in the morning, regime’s forces fired rockets with

Enas's post provides links to photographs and videos [ **Warning: Graphic** ]
showing the unfolding tragedy.

Enas adds:

> Symptoms of the patients include nausea, hallucinations, suffocation, hard

> Activists also report the lack of Atropine that is usually used to treat

> available too. Medics are only using vinegar to the mouth and nose and are
> washing the bodies of the victims by water.

The number of those killed has been on the rise since. Hala Droubi offers
another toll:

Mohannad shares a photograph from a field hospital in Daraya, where he says
there isn't room to treat more of those injured:

> Field hospital in Daraya doesn't even have enough room to treat the injured.

And he challenges the media to break the wall of silence on atrocities being
committed in Syria:

> If the media doesn't want to speak up then we will. We will never be silent.

She adds that the bombing followed the victims, taken to nearby Erbin, for
treatment:

Assad's official Syrian news agency said the allegations were designed to
[derail an ongoing United Nations (UN)
inquiry](http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-syria-rebels-say-scores-
dead-in-poisongas-attack-20130821,0,5386089.story?track=rss). This week, an UN
inspection team arrived in Syria to start an investigation into charges of
chemical weapons, which each side has accused the other of numerous times in
the [two-year
conflict.](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/surviving-in-syria/)

Correction: The headline in an earlier version of this article was “Assad
Wages Chemical Warfare on Al Ghouta, a Damascus Suburb” and attributed the
reported nerve gas attack to activists, instead of Syrian opposition forces.
The second last paragraph, “Assad's official Syrian news agency said the
allegations ..” was not in the earlier version.
