Zambia’s victory over Ivory Coast in the finals of the 2012[ Africa Cup of
Nations ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Cup_of_Nations)(AFCON 2012), co-
hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, has been celebrated by Zambians and
neighboring Southern African nations alike. Zambia beat the star-studded Ivory
Coast team by eight goals to seven in a match that went into penalties after a
barren draw in extra time.

Most poignant was a [satirical
article](http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2012/02/13/death-
announcement-%E2%80%93-an-elephant-of-i-coast-killed-by-copper-bullets/
"satirical write up") on the Malawi's Nyasa Times website titled “Death
Announcement An Elephant of I. Coast Killed By Copper Bullets.” The Zambia
National Soccer Team is fondly known as Chipolopolo or bullet while the Ivory
Coast team is known by the elephant moniker.

In another story coming from Namibia reproduced by [Zambian
Watchdog](http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/index.php/zambia/namibian-fans-hail-
chipolopolo/ "Zambian Watchdog"):

One Namibian football administrator, according to the story, attributed the
win to the Southern African Development Community (SADC):

> Local soccer fan and soccer official, Ben Lumponjani, said, “I’m feeling
> very happy right now, like it’s Namibia which won, because these guys have

But Zambians themselves have continued celebrating the victory which also
brought three of Zambia’s present and past presidents, the incumbent Michael
Sata and two surviving past presidents Rupiah Banda who was
[defeated](http://tumfweko.com/2012/02/15/rb-fails-to-resist-donchi-kubeba-
slogan/ "defeated") as sitting president in the 2011 elections and Zambia’s
first president Kenneth Kaunda.

Rupiah Banda is reported to have danced to the now ruling PF’s campaign
anthem, “Donchi Kubeba” during the celebrations at State House when the team
arrived from their conquering mission.

Former Republican president, Rupiah Banda,[ could not resist the ‘magic charm’
of the ‘Donchi Kubeba’ fever ](http://www.lusakatimes.com/2012/02/15/donchi-
kubeba-rb/)when he joined in to dance to Dandy Crazy’s hit song at First Lady,
Christine Kaseba’s luncheon held in honour of the triumphant Zambia national
soccer team.

Mr Banda, who also raised his index finger to his lips in the ‘Donchi Kubeba’
style while on the dance floor, stood up to join President Michael Sata and
First president, Kenneth Kaunda, among other guests who had already taken to
the floor.

While the mood in the country was celebratory, others could not help but point
out the shortcomings particularly with how the Chipolopolo team was received.

One tweep, probably comparing the star-studded Ivory Coast team in which most
of the players ply their trade in the English Premier League with the Zambian
whose professionals are not very well known on the world stage, wrote:
