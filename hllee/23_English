Girls from Newar community wearing traditional wedding dresses take part in
Bael Bibaha, a practice where a girl is wed to a bael fruit. Its not child
marriage, but a traditional ritual which symbolises that once they are married
(as adults), they will never become widows because they have been married to a
symbol of god (the fruit) as children. Copyright Demotix (3/12/2011)

Child- parents are a harsh reality in South Asia where [child marriage remains
rampant](http://www.icrw.org/publications/child-marriage-south-asia-realities-
responses-and-way-forward) despite efforts by governments and civil society to
combat it. In this environment, it is particularly girls who suffer being
trapped in a cycle of poverty through a sudden end to their education,
trapping the next generation of children they have, in a similar fate.

Last year, [4,000 brides in
Nepal](http://www.ekantipur.com/np/2070/12/30/full-
story/387413.html#sthash.wtn0oWU5.uxfs) were younger than 15-years-old,
despite the fact that the [legal age for
marriage](http://www.wvi.org/nepal/publication/child-marriage-nepal) for both
girls and boys is 18 with parental consent and 20 without consent.

Mainly affecting the most historically marginalized class, the _dalits_ ,
(also known as ‘the untouchables’ for their position in the dying Hindu caste
system), child marriage is often conducted in secret; part-ritual and part
economic necessity, in the southern lowland belt of the country known as the
[Terai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Terai_Valleys_of_Nepal). In some of
eastern Terai's districts data from 2012 shows that more than half of
marriages involve girls [under the age of
12](http://www.irinnews.org/report/95654/nepal-the-hidden-costs-of-early-
marriage).

**A childhood lost**

Once married, child brides must immediately grapple with adult
responsibilities imposed on them by their communities. Procreation — despite
the fact they are not physically or emotionally ready — is a key expectation.

According to [United Nations Population Fund](
http://www.irinnews.org/fr/report/100492/analysis-why-child-marriage-persists-
in-nepal ) (UNFPA), when a young under-age bride gets pregnant, her risks of
dying during childbirth are five times higher rate than a girl in her
twenties.

After mothering children, it is highly unlikely that she will have the chance
to resume her education, leaving her at the mercy of illiteracy, physical and
emotional abuse, and poverty.

According to a [2014 report by the Global Partnership for
Education](http://www.globalpartnership.org/content/school-sector-reform-plan-
extension-2014-2016-nepal), in Nepal the female literacy rate is only 57%,
compared to 75% for men, largely due to a high dropout rate at schools in the
country. Moreover, research indicates that girls who marry [before their 15th
birthday](http://www.voicesofyouth.org/en/posts/condition-of-child-marriage-
in-nepal) have three or more children compared to women aged between 20 and
24.

One of the main reasons girls are married young is related to their dowry, or
the price that they are required to pay to the groom’s family.

As a girl gets older and more educated, her dowry price increases. Indeed,
with prices ranging from [US$200 to
$20,000](http://www.irinnews.org/fr/report/95654/nepal-the-hidden-costs-of-
early-marriage), depending on the age of the bride and her qualifications,
poor parents are dis-incentivised from sending their daughters to school. Her
in-laws, themselves illiterate, will at any rate force her to focus on
household chores. This explains why some experts have argued that the best way
to combat the practice would be by prosecuting families, but law might be
difficult to enforce in areas where the state's reach is limited.

Escaping is hard. But some, like the [kidnapped 13-year old dalit
child](http://news.yahoo.com/kidnapped-13-nepals-dalit-child-
brides-044202169.html) who was both courageous and lucky, are able to return
to school.

Boys also suffer. Shashank Bengali, the Los Angeles Times’ South Asia
correspondent, [explains ](http://www.latimes.com/world/great-reads/la-
fg-c1-nepal-child-grooms-20150127-story.html#page=1)that child marriage is a
popular way of controlling the sexuality of boys and getting rid of them in
large families.

By the age of 13, many cross the border into India to find work as migrant
laborers, leaving their wives and children at home to fend for themselves.

**Breaking a cycle**

With the effects of the practice well-documented, many question an apparent
lack of progress in combating this practice:

The Nepali government and civic campaigners have attempted to tackle the dowry
system:

These efforts are stymied by other realities such as the fact that schools are
overloaded with children, not to mention often [very
far](http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/child-marriage-defies-laws-in-nepal/) from
villages, making the option of going to school difficult.

But there is hope.

Since 2009, schools through grade ten have been made free for girls. This has
given rise to unexpected stories such as girls gaining empowerment through
[playing football](http://www.aworldatschool.org/news/entry/how-football-is-
helping-girls-in-nepal-study-and-avoid-child-marriage-1535) or by actually
being the initiators of their own marriages.

Some observe the rise of a ‘dating’ scene made possible by the penetration of
hindi Bollywood culture and mobile phones:

Adolescents who work as advocates in Nepal’s western region suggest that in a
patriarchal society such as Nepal, empowering girls to create change is more
relevant than ever:

To stop the practice of child marriage however, will require much more effort:

In November of 2014, governments in the South Asia Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) followed up on an August 2014 adoption of a [Regional
Action Plan to End Child
Marriage](http://www.saievac.org/download/Thematic%20Area%20Resources/Child%20Marriage/RAP_Child_Marriage.pdf)
with a Kathmandu Call for Action to End Child Marriage in Asia.

These plans support the specific target of ending child marriage through the
use of the rule of law and legal strategies that promote accountability for
ending child marriage.

It is hoped that these new steps will have a strong impact.

This last tweet leaves us with hope that no matter how old a person, a fresh
outlook is always possible:
