As Russia recovers from [massive
wildfires](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/04/20/russian-siberia-five-
years-later-still-neglected-still-burning/) in the Siberian regions of
Khakassia and Zabaikal, Ukraine has encountered an even more alarming problem:
a 400-hectare wildfire dangerously close to the Chernobyl exclusion zone.

Ukrainian officials have said that Reactor Four, which failed during the 1986
[Chernobyl disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster), is not
in danger from the wildfire. Still, Ukraine has mobilized firefighters, the
National Guard, and head officials to the affected area to prevent a potential
crisis. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who
[arrived](http://lenta.ru/news/2015/04/28/chernobylyatc/) at the scene of the
fire on April 28, has said that even though the situation is “under control,”
it is the [largest wildfire](http://www.unian.net/society/1072764-yatsenyuk-o-
situatsii-v-chernobyilskoy-zone-eto-naibolshiy-pojar-s-1992-goda.html) near
Chernobyl since a massive 1992 blaze.

The Ukrainian Minister of Interior Affairs, Arsen Avakov, initially [announced
the
situation](https://www.facebook.com/arsen.avakov.1/posts/827789043977870?pnref=story)
on his Facebook page on the evening of April 28, when strong winds were making
it likely the fire could spread to the 20 km (12.5 mile) exclusion zone around
Chernobyl.

As in the case with the wildfires in Russia, social media has already emerged
as a vital tool in distributing information to local residents regarding the
status of the wildfire. Along with Minister Avakov, the Ukrainian head of the
State Service of Emergency Situations, Zoryan Shkiryak, has been providing
[regular
updates](https://www.facebook.com/zoryan.zoryan/posts/892690787458536?pnref=story)
on the wildfire on Facebook, detailing the response to and the extent of the
blaze.

However, much as Greenpeace had criticized the Russian response to the
Siberian wildfires, the environmental organization has cited different figures
on the Chernobyl wildfire from those released by Ukrainian officials. Soon
after statements from Avakov and Shkiryak putting the size of the wildfire at
4,000 hectares or fewer, Greenpeace put the blaze at [10,000
hectares](http://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2015/04/28/n_7151529.shtml).

**Reactions From Nearby**  
Many in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv, which lies about 100 km (62 miles) south of
Chernobyl, have expressed concerns regarding the fire online. [A
poll](http://vk.com/wall-32195333_6383218) on the popular “Typical Kyiv”
(Типичный Киев) VK group asked users if they could smell the smoke from the
wildfire, garnering about 4000 responses (only 20% said yes).

Though it is unlikely than the smoke these 20% were smelling was smoke from
the wildfire, [another popular
post](http://vk.com/typical_kiev?w=wall-32195333_6382137) in the group
offering tips for dealing with radiation demonstrated the anxiety that still
looms over Ukraine a generation after the Chernobyl disaster. But radiation
levels in the capital remained within norm, as journalist Sergiy Karazy
demonstrated in [a FB
post](https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.karazy/posts/824384307645602):

**Reactions From Further Away**  
While the online reaction in Kyiv was one of panicked concern, the response
from separatist-held eastern Ukraine was slightly more bizarre. According to a
conspiracy theory from one [pro-separatist news website](http://news-
front.info/2015/04/28/pozhar-v-zone-chaes-shantazh-i-provokaciya-dlya-
evrosoyuza/), the Ukrainian government may have started the wildfire as a “
_provokatsiya_ ” (provocation, roughly equating to a “false flag”) in order to
extract financial assistance from the European Union, representatives of which
had recently visited Kyiv.

Though it seems implausible that Ukrainian officials plotted a fire near the
site of a nuclear disaster only to provide by-the-minute social media updates
on firefighting later, Minister Avakov has [indicated via his
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arsen.avakov.1?pnref=story%5d) that arson
could be a likely cause of the fire.

As of the morning of Wednesday, April 29, emergency officials
[said](http://www.mns.gov.ua/news/39154.html) the fire was contained, with
over 300 people and 50 vehicles working to extinguish the remaining blazes in
an area narrowed down to 270 hectares. Whatever the facts, both the panic and
the conspiracy theories will likely smolder for a while. As Ukrainian
emergency responders fight to prevent a further disaster in Chernobyl, the
information war seems to burn as hot as ever.
