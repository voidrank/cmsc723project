Video records the moment when Rio de Janeiro officials armed with bulldozers
descend into Restinga, intent on demolishing the homes and businesses of 153
families who live in the neighborhood.

Francisca de Pinho Melo describes her desperate attempts to stop the
demolition crews:

Launched in January 2013, the footage is part of the second installation of
the a mini documentary series “O Legado Somos Nós” (The Legacy Is All of Us),
produced by the human rights organization Witness in a partnership with the
Rio People's World Cup and Olympics Committee (Comitê Popular Rio Copa e
Olimpíadas). The evictions and demolitions in the Restinga neighborhood on the
west side of Rio de Janeiro that appear in the documentary took place in 2010
in order to widen the Avenida das Américas in the district of Recreio dos
Bandeirantes, a pre-requisite for the installation of the bus express lane
[Transoeste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransOeste).

Up to now, the residents received negligible compensation for their loss,
whereas the business owners received no compensation at all, even though the
Municipal Decree no. [20.454, from
2001](http://raquelrolnik.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/decreto-
nc2ba-34522-de-3-de-outubro-de-2011-pref-rio-de-janeiro.pdf) [pt] established
that, in the case of a business, “a new business unit, compensation or
purchase of some other facility subject to the same criteria as the ones
established for premises of residential use, as provided in the SMH projects,
should be offered”.

According to the documentary, 8,000 people have already lost their houses in
Rio de Janeiro since the beginning of preparations for upcoming World Cup and
Olympic Games, and the dossier published by the Rio People's World Cup and
Olympics Committee states that about 30,000 people in the city will forcibly
be evicted due to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games.

**Families “lose everything”**

no caminho da Transoeste.” Agência Pública

In the video, Francisca says that she lost the cabinetmaking business where
she worked side-by-side with her husband, her daughter, and two relatives when
they demolished the neighborhood. She says she had to restart life in another
community, making a living out of selling meals:

> Eu estava na marcenaria há uns seis, sete anos. Tinhamos uma renda até boa,
> que estava dando para a gente suprir nossas necessidades. Quando aconteceu
> isso a gente ficou uns três meses sem ganhar nada, só gastando. Aí viemos
> morar de aluguel. O mais difícil são os filhos, é difícil ver um filho
> pedir. Meus amigos, parentes, vizinhos foram doando uma porta, um balcão e
> agora eu estou vendendo refeição, lanche, refrigerante. Chego a trabalhar 18
> horas por dia.

> I had been working in the cabinetmaking business for some six or seven
> years. Our income was quite reasonable, enough to meet our needs. When this
> happened, we went three months without earning any money at all, only
> spending money. Then we had to start paying rent on a house. The most
> difficult part of this situation is the children, it is hard to see a child
> begging. My friends, relatives, neighbors donated a door, a counter, and now
> I am making a living selling meals, snacks, soft drinks. I work as long as
> 18 hours a day.

Francisca, who lost not only her house, but also her work and her source of
income, told Copa Pública that she is still fighting along with a public
defender to get fair compensation for the loss of the cabinetmaking business;
as for the loss of the house, she has had to accept the symbolic value of
3,800 reais [about 1,800 US dollars] offered by the city government:

> Eu perdi tudo, minha casa, meu trabalho, a fonte de renda da minha família.
> Pior ficou quem morava e trabalhava no mesmo lugar, que não recebeu nada.

> I lost everything, my house, my work, my family's source of income. It was
> worse for people who used to live and work in the same place, and did not
> get any compensation for it.
