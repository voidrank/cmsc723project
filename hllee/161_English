In March 2011, when [Syrians started taking to the streets
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/syria-protest-2011/)to demand
freedom and justice, it was hard to imagine that a year later the regime would
have killed thousands of people and tortured and arrested countless others.
The city of Homs has been besieged since the beginning of February and suffers
an unprecedented crackdown against its entire population, with a death toll of
[100 every day](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-
east/un-100-civilians-killed-in-syria-every-day-7462651.html).

While international powers have not agreed on the need to pressure the Assad
regime, global citizens solidarity with Syrians has been increasing and it
will likely garner more support now that we are reaching the anniversary of
the Syrian revolution.

An initiative called _Global March for Syria_ aims to take people from all
over the world to the streets on March 15, 16 and 17 in support of the Syrian
people's struggle. The campaign is explained in a video called “Against a
Dictator” that has been widely shared online:

Marches for Syria are already planned in 16 cities, and the list keeps growing
every day. Activists have created a [Facebook event
](https://www.facebook.com/events/355415564493036/)with information on the
different marches, where they encourage citizens worldwide to stand with Syria
against oppression:

> One year since the Syrian revolution began. One year of violence against
> peaceful protesters and innocent civilians. One year of bloodshed. And one
> year of a brave stance against great evil, but the Syrian people have vowed
> to never stop until the fall of the regime, until they gain freedom and
> dignity. On March 15-17, 2012 let's stand with Syria against oppression and
> take a moment to remember the thousands of lives sacrificed since March 15,
> 2011.
