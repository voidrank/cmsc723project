When The New York Times reports on Spain, Spanish media report on The New York
Times. The American newspaper's coverage of the country throughout the
crushing economic crisis of the last several years has routinely made
headlines, and a February 18, 2014 story about the relative lateness of
Spain's national schedule was no exception.

The article, titled “[Spain, Land of 10 P.M. Dinners, Asks if It’s Time to
Reset Clock](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/world/europe/spain-land-
of-10-pm-dinners-ponders-a-more-standard-time.html?hp&_r=2)“, profiles a small
movement that wants to bring the country's traditional schedule – with its
late bedtime, long lunches and even longer workdays – in line with the rest of
Europe in the hopes of boosting productivity.

The Gray Lady's story, which ran on the front page of the print edition below
the fold, made its way into the Spanish news cycle throughout the day,
appearing on [more than a
dozen](https://news.google.com/news?ncl=dNyoRhyFBNqsxxM1kw4AwKenJJwwM&q=espa%C3%B1a+siesta+new+york+times&lr=Spanish&hl=es&sa=X&ei=Yu0DU6y1D6HK0AX2h4GwCA&ved=0CDkQqgIwAA)
news sites. Criticism was heaped on reporter Jim Yardley for evoking the
stereotypical _siesta_ , or midday nap, a thing of the past for most working
people in Spain and a sore spot for Spaniards fed up with skewed foreign
coverage.

Some outlets used headlines claiming that The New York Times “[criticizes the
Spanish lifestyle](http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/el-new-york-times-
critica-habitos-de-la-vida-de-los-espanoles-y-propone-unos-
cambios_D3iWJ5bVSk2qJNiWs6fmw3/)” or was outright “[against the _siesta_ and
Spanish schedule](http://www.intereconomia.com/noticias-negocios/su-
bolsillo/the-new-york-times-ahora-siesta-y-los-horarios-espanoles-20140218).”
A poor translation of the story's own headline that traded “Spain […] Asks if
It's Time to Reset Clock” for the more accusatory “Spain, […] Ask Yourselves
if It's Time to Change Schedules” (“[España, el país de las cenas a las 10
P.M, preguntaos si no es hora de cambiar los
horarios](http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/el-new-york-times-critica-
habitos-de-la-vida-de-los-espanoles-y-propone-unos-
cambios_D3iWJ5bVSk2qJNiWs6fmw3/)“) further fanned the flames.

While some Spaniards got behind the idea of dialing back their country's
clock, others took to social media to defend Spanish culture.

**Kick ‘em when they're down**

It's not the first time during the economic crisis that The New York Times or
other American and British media have acted as a rallying point for Spaniards
who see the reporting as sensationalized or arrogant. British newspaper The
Telegraph ruffled feathers with a similar report in September 2013 (“[Time's
up for siestas, delayed meetings and late nights, Spaniards told in effort to
make them work
better](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/10329093/Times-
up-for-siestas-delayed-meetings-and-late-nights-Spaniards-told-in-effort-to-
make-them-work-better.html)“) on a Spanish parliamentary commission's call to
reform the working schedule. A photo of a shirtless pot-bellied man sleeping
upright in a chair outdoors originally accompanied the story, but was
[swapped](http://www.abc.es/espana/20131002/abci-telegraph-foto-
ofensiva-201310021759.html) after the paper received complaints for a less
crude shot of a man in a button-up shirt and newsboy cap napping in a horse-
drawn carriage.

Much more outcry followed another [front-
page](http://kiosko.net/us/2012-09-25/np/newyork_times.html), below-the-fold
story published in The New York Times in 2012 that featured a black-and-white
photo of a man rummaging through a dumpster. The
[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/world/europe/hunger-on-the-rise-
in-spain.html) detailed the problem of hunger against the backdrop of Spain's
high unemployment – about a quarter of all Spaniards are out of work, while
the number is closer to 50 percent for young people. It also cited Catholic
charity Caritas’ report that it had provided meals for nearly one million
Spaniards in 2010, more than twice the number in 2007 before the crisis. A
slide show of photos capturing scenes of protest and poverty was published
online alongside it.

The story and accompanying photos sparked heated discussions online. An
Internet campaign
[#paraNYTimes](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23paraNYTIMES&src=typd) countered
the narrative by collecting more [positive
snapshots](http://www.alaatenciondelnewyorktimes.com/las-otras-fotos-
paranytimes/) of daily life. One user on [Reddit-like website
Menéame](http://www.meneame.net/story/marca-espana-portada-the-new-york-

**Holding up a mirror**

Others saw the story as confirmation that the situation in Spain had indeed
gone from bad to worse. Responding to an analysis published by online news
site eldiario.es, “[What happens when the most influential newspaper on the
planet gives you the third degree](http://www.eldiario.es/politica/espana-
crisis-periodismo-new-york-times_0_53894743.html),” commenter “kio” wrote:

When it was revealed last summer by an ex-Popular Party treasurer that current
Spanish President Mariano Rajoy had received payments from a secret slush fund
for years, the international media coverage was taken by some as an important
echo of the corruption in the country's politics.

And a New York Times piece from May 2013 detailing the culture of corruption
in local and national politics – about [1,000
officials](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/world/europe/in-lean-years-after-
boom-spains-graft-laid-bare.html?ref=spain) were under investigation at the
time, according to the article – stirred up similar reactions.

“I hope the damage that this New York Times article causes to this rotten
system makes it so that there are more and more people who are ready to change
this terrible reality of corruption, abuse and power,” a Menéame commenter
[wrote](http://www.meneame.net/story/the-new-york-times-publicara-reportaje-
sobre-corrupcion-espana/c053#c-53).

**The power of foreign coverage**

But why is so much attention given to foreign media's editorial choices? With
tourism a major driver of the Spanish economy, accounting for [10.9
percent](http://www.ine.es/prensa/np829.pdf) of the country's economic output
in 2012 according to Spain's National Institute of Statistics, many worry
about the _marca España_ , or Spanish brand, being portrayed to the rest of
the world.

Positive coverage can certainly have an impact. After The New York Times
included Burgos in its list of “46 Places to Go in 2013,” the northern Spanish
city saw a staggering 145 percent jump in American tourists, what one local
paper dubbed “[the New York Times
effect](http://www.diariodeburgos.es/noticia/Z3EC3D126-FCF1-F588-924BC48C62B1861B/20130514/efecto/new/york/times/eleva/145/numero/turistas/eeuu).”
And the level of confidence that potential overseas investors have in the
stability of a country can make or break their decision to put money there.

But with foreign coverage sticking to its largely negative focus and the
country's political and economic struggles still ongoing,
[#MarcaEspaña](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23marcaespa%C3%B1a&src=typd) has
become go-to sarcastic commentary on social media for Spaniards unhappy with
the current state of affairs.

Still, others recommend ignoring the coverage. For better or worse, foreign
media will continue to report on Spain how they want.
