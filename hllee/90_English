Promises](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/04/17/displaced-residents-

After spending almost two years in the village of New Mutum, a city
constructed by company [Energia Sustentável
](http://www.energiasustentaveldobrasil.com.br/?lg=2)[en] to house the
engineers and foremen of its [Jirau power plant
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirau_Dam)[en] as well as the river dwellers,
known as [ribeirinhos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribeirinhos) [en], who
were displaced when the area was flooded for the plant, the Batista family
decided to return closer to the river. Alongside the same neighbors from the
old Mutum, they constructed a wooden house next to a
[bayou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou) called Jirau.

But now there’s a suspicion that this area will also be flooded.

This news flows among the inhabitants and workers of the power plant and is
being investigated by public attorney Renata Ribeiro Baptista from the federal
public prosecutor’s office in the federal state of
[Rondônia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rond%C3%B4nia) [en]. “Jirau denies it,
but we are following this closely,” she declares:

> Essa situação mostra o dilema dos ribeirinhos. Eles correram de volta para
> os seus hábitos de vida, que estão ligados à proximidade ao rio. Mas a vida
> como eles conheciam foi tomada pela usina.

> This situation shows the dilemma faced by the river dwellers. They went back
> to their way of life, tied to the proximity of the river. But life as they
> knew it was taken away by the power plant.

“I no longer consider myself a Brazilian citizen. I feel like a dog on a leash
that can’t choose where to go,” says Jonas Romani, a 55-year-old fisherman. He
lived in the district of Jaci Paraná that was flooded by the [Santo Antônio
power plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Ant%C3%B4nio_Dam) [en]. Like
Batista, he moved to the Jirau river and now loses sleep over the possibility
of having to move again. “If they aren’t sure if this area will be flooded,
why not close this area off? They let us come here, build our things, plant
our manioc, only to flood everything all over again?”

The process of wrenching people from where they have built their lives is
always subject to injustices. There are small injustices and there are big
ones. The story of Esmeralda Marinho Gomes, 63, is one of the larger ones.

She had rented a house in old Mutum since 2006. Even those who rented had the
right to choose between a compensation of 55,000 Brazilian reais (about 28,000
US dollars) or a small house in New Mutum. But the week that the power plant
employees came through to create a registry of inhabitants, she was away
working at the mine. When she returned, she began her saga of attempts to
contact the power plant. As the community was one of squatters, the houses
didn't have official documentation and therefore, there was no contract, only
an agreement with the owner:

> Primeiro disseram que era estudo de caso. Depois, que não tinha prova
> suficiente.

> They initially said her case was under study. Later, they stated there was
> insufficient proof.

She never received compensation.

While her neighbors were in New Mutum, Esmeralda rented a room in the village.
When the first few began moving to the Jirau bayou, she moved with them.

With the breakup of the river dwellers and cuts at the power plant, the future
of the 1,600 homes in New Mutum becomes worrisome. The Jirau plant is
progressively reducing the number of workers. The work is scheduled to finish
in 2016, when the number of employees near the infrastructure created to house
them will be reduced to a minimum. Until now, no industry or activity
generating an income independent from the construction of the power plant has
been created in the area.

“I've already got my little house in Jaru [another river different than the
Madeira river]” says Sônia, a former inhabitant of the old Mutum who has a
clothing shop in New Mutum:

> Quando acabar a obra, acabou o emprego, acabou tudo. Isso aqui vai virar uma
> cidade-fantasma.

> When the construction is finished, the work is finished, everything is
> finished. This here will become a ghost town.

The project [Amazônia
Pública](http://www.apublica.org/amazoniapublica/?page_id=19) [pt] (Public
Amazon) took three teams of reporters from the Reporting and Investigative
Journalism Agência Pública to travel through three Amazonian regions between
July and October 2012, among them the hydroelectric plants of the Madeira
River in Rondônia. All of the reports search to explore the complexities of
the current investments in the Amazon, including the negotiations and
political maneuvering as well as listening to all the actors involved —
governments, companies, and civil society — to trace the context in which
these projects have been developed. The principal viewpoint of these reports,
as with all reports from Agência Pública, is always the public interest: how
actions, political negotiations, and economics have had an impact, in
practice, on the lives of the population.
