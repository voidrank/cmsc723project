This past weekend Madrileños took to the streets in droves to show their fury
with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy over [new corruption
allegations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/02/02/massive-political-
corruption-case-causes-outrage-in-spain/). On Thursay, the national newspaper
[El País
published](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/01/30/actualidad/1359583204_085918.html)
[es] images of ledgers in which Rajoy and other top Partido Popular members
appear as receiving illegal payments
([#lospapelesdebarcenas](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lospapelesdeB%C3%A1rcenas&src=hash)
[es]). Protests concentrated outside the Party's headquarters lasted all
weekend.

On Monday, Spain's opposition Socialist Party called for Rajoy's resignation.
Rajoy has maintained that the claims are “totally false” and denies receiving
such payments. He rejected calls for his resignation and claims his party is
best suited to see the country through its current economic difficulty.

Here, a photo gallery of the weekend's events taken by the author.
