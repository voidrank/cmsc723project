**THE YELLOW HOUSE**

Do you know what the “[Yellow House](http://sr.wikipedia.org/sr-
el/%D0%94%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_%D0%96%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%9B%D0%B0)”
is? Have you ever heard about it?

The same year [Kosovo declared
independence](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/02/19/serbia-bloggers-
discuss-kosovo-independence/), 2008, [Carla Del
Ponte,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Del_Ponte) a former prosecutor of
[the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia](http://www.icty.org/), published (in Serbia) her controversial
book [“The hunt: me and war
criminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt:_Me_and_the_War_Criminals),”
in which she described in detail how and where some soldiers and leaders of
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) committed terrible war crimes against ethnic
Serbs, non-Albanians and “non-loyal” citizens of Kosovo in 1999.

According to Del Ponte, the “Yellow House” was a little apartment house in
Ripe, a village near the town of Burelj in north Albania, where body parts of
prisoners of war were being removed in order to be sold on black markets all
over the world.

Many from the region, who then heard about [the human organ
trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_theft_in_Kosovo) for the first time,
were shocked. The book and the information from it caused a lot of different
reactions in Serbia.

Below is a selection of [comments to an

on this issue that appeared on _pressonline.rs_ on March 22, 2008.

_Miki_ :

Kosovo’s officials denied there had been [human organs trafficking in
Kosovo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Kosovo). Writing
about the issue, the Guardian
[emphasized](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/10/war-crimes-
must-not-relativised) that some members of the international community had the
same opinion, quoting a statement of [ Bernar
Kouchner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Kouchner), the French foreign
minister and former head of the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo,
who said this during his visit to the Serb enclave of Gracanica earlier this
year:

> there was no yellow house, there was no organ trade. People who talk about
> things like that are bums and murderers.

**DICK MARTY’S REPORT**

Just two days after the general elections were held in Kosovo on Dec. 12,
[Hashim Thaci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashim_Tha%C3%A7i), the outgoing
Prime Minister whose Democratic Party of Kosovo won the most votes on Sunday’s
elections, [was accused](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11997272) by
[Dick Marty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Marty), the [Council of Europe
Parliamentary Assembly](http://assembly.coe.int/) investigator, of organizing
and committing the mentioned war crimes.

According to [Marty’s
report](http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/NewsManager/EMB_NewsManagerView.asp?ID=6171&L=2),
which the Guardian
[published](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/14/kosovo-prime-minister-
llike-mafia-boss) exclusively before its official presentation, Thaci, who is
also the former head of KLA's “Drenica group,” is allegedly responsible for
the kidnapping of more than 300 ethnic Serbs and others from Kosovo during the
war, their transportation and murder in Albania, where their organs were
extracted and later sold to rich patients in the West.

Below are some of the reader comments to [a B92
article](http://www.b92.co.rs/info/komentari.php?yyyy=2010&mm=12&dd=15&nav_id=479375)
about Marty's report:

_Polako, ali sigurno, pravda stize do cilja!_ writes:

> […] If it is proved that you are the culprits, and it will be so, you don’t
> need to be afraid of Serbs but of your own people who brought you to power.

_Skorpion_ :

> As an ethnic Albanian, I am happy that, God willing, all who committed the
> crimes are convicted. I hate them all and I don’t want to hear about them.

_Ode sve u_ :

Writing about the issue in her post titled “Trading organs and principles” (on
the blog page of the daily newspaper “Blic”), Jelena Milic [pointed
out](http://blog.blic.rs/524/Trgovina-organima-i-principima) the double
standards in Serbia’s official policy in regard to human rights, an obsolete
policy that considers human rights a problem of individual states and not of
international relations:

> […] Dick Marty’s report, which has linked Thaci to organs trade, has just
> been adopted in the committee for legal questions of the Council of Europe
> Parliamentary Assembly. It’s very important news in Serbia. For a reason.
> But. Serbia's [foreign minister] Vuk Jeremic has a shameful record of not
> voting for and supporting resolutions and declarations which the EU and the
> Council of Europe adopted and submitted to the General Assembly of the
> United Nations in regard to the human rights situation in Iran and other
> countries that do not recognize Kosovo's independence […]

The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine
Ashton's Spokeswoman Maja Kocijančić has urged Marty to come forward with the
evidence on Thaci’s involvement in these serious crimes. She
[said](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-
article.php?yyyy=2010&mm=12&dd=15&nav_id=71541) at a press conference:

> “These claims are taken very seriously. If concrete evidence exists, we urge
> Dick Marty to submit it to the relevant authorities.

However, she avoided answering a number of direct questions on the EU's next
steps regarding the issue.

Hashim Thaci rejected all accusations and demanded from the EU to investigate
this case thoroughly.
