Kazakhstan was craving to head the Organization for Cooperation and Security
in Europe, OSCE, the largest international pro-democracy organization on the
continent. The bid was criticized by some member countries because of the
Kazakhstan’s poor human rights record. Eventually the chairmanship was granted
in result of a set of reasons that included a geopolitical bargaining, a
pressure from the post-Soviet states, and a series of the West’s energy and
security considerations.

The Kazakh authorities were viewing the chairmanship mostly as a high-profile
instrument to improve its image on the international arena. And the OSCE
Summit, a conference of the leaders of the OSCE participating states, was
meant to become the wreath of the Kazakh chairmanship and a chance to boast
the country’s new capital city of Astana. It finally took place in early
December. The preparations were stunning:

> participants […] Most of the city dwellers are shocked by the official
> initiative of introducing a sickness limit”, _zhuldyz_

The Astanians residing close to the venue and major roads were even prohibited
from smoking on their balconies – a ban that stirred a massive [satire
campaign](http://yvision.kz/community/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%20Yvision/89473.html)
titled “Be a man, get a smoke” [ru].

_Slavasay_ was keeping a [close
eye](http://slavasay.livejournal.com/86583.html) on the summit from within the
event’s corridors [ru]:

> The summit will definitely justify the Kazakh government’s expectations […]
> with the picture-taking ceremony at the center of the whole event.

He later commented on the welcoming speech by the Kazakh Secretary of State,
who started his presentation with congratulations to the incumbent president
of Kazakhstan on 19th anniversary of his election as the president. “I found
such an opening remark to the meeting of the leaders of countries – that are
meant to be democratic – pretty original”, he
[said](http://slavasay.livejournal.com/87505.html) [ru].

Slavasay was also among those who criticized the summit’s excessively
obtrusive and overly exalted coverage of the summit in Kazakh media. All news
programs were overwhelmed with summit reports. On the first day of the event,
all state-owned and private TV channels held a many-hour live broadcast of the
summit sessions. _Megakhuimyak_

_Slavasay’s_ conclusion is [as
follows](http://slavasay.livejournal.com/88540.html) [ru]:

> The summit will definitely go down in history, but only as the most useless
> for all 35 years of the OSCE’s history. The Astana Declaration doesn’t
> differ from any other documents adopted at any annual Ministerial Councils.
