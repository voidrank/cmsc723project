A human rights group in Cambodia has released a
[report](http://cchrcambodia.org/index_old.php?url=media%2Fmedia.php&p=factsheet_detail.php&fsid=68&id=5)
showing an increase of Internet-related arrests made by the Cambodian
government from August 2015 to January 2016.

The Cambodian Center for Human Rights monitored seven cases wherein social
media users accused of defamation or inciting violence were arrested by
authorities. It also noted that 24 Internet users have been publicly
threatened since August 2015 because of comments or posts they uploaded on
various social media platforms, most especially on Facebook.

One of those arrested was a student who called for a [‘color
revolution’](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/student-arrested-after-
posting-about-revolution) on Facebook to reform Cambodian society. Another
case involved an opposition politician accused of promoting treason.

The human rights group acknowledged that not all cases involve “sensible or
constructive criticism” of the government, but still it is worried that
Internet users are arrested for simply commenting on social media:

> Although not all of the following cases involve sensible or constructive
> criticism, they do plainly illustrate a deeply troubling trend, whereby
> those who criticize the political elite are routinely being arrested for
> expressing their views on social media.

It also warned that the high-profile arrests done by the government could lead
to self-censorship and prevent ordinary citizens from criticizing public
officials:

> The creation of a culture of self-censorship is particularly worrying in the
> political domain, as the expression and tolerance of diverse views is
> essential to maintaining a healthy democracy.

Last year, the Cambodian Centre for Independent Media also
[observed](http://www.ccimcambodia.org/press-release/128-action-needed-to-
protect-online-expression) “a pattern of increasing government restrictions of
online freedom of expression.”

> The Internet, once Cambodia’s last open and free medium for press freedom
> and free expression, is now becoming increasingly restrictive and subject to
> the government controls that have for so long limited the country’s
> mainstream media.

A government spokesman [denied](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/ngo-
notes-uptick-govt-threats-against-online-posters) that rights are being
violated and defended the decision to prosecute those who “disrespect”
Cambodian officials. The official added that there’s no crackdown of free
speech in the country but only lawful arrests done by the government to
protect the privacy of individuals, national security, and Cambodian heritage.
This reasoning echoes the statement of Prime Minister Hun Sen last January who
[lambasted](https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/doctored-image-of-first-lady-
draws-pms-ire-104226/) Internet users for doctoring an image of his wife:

> All actions that ruin my honor and my family’s honor, as a prime minister of
> a country, those must be responsible before the law. If I want to take
> action against you, we will get [you] within seven hours at the most.

Hun Sen has been in power for thirty years already making him the longest-
serving leader in Southeast Asia.

The release of the report coincided with Hun Sen’s
[endorsement](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/hun-sens-facebook-panel-
plan-draws-flak) of Facebook as a mechanism to monitor the complaints and
suggestions of ordinary citizens. He even instructed his Cabinet to form
special committees to collate the views and proposals made by Facebook users
on his official page.

Many Cambodians are amused by Hun Sen’s sudden interest on Facebook and even
welcomed the chance to interact with the prime minister through social media.
But the report of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights is a timely reminder
that even if it is interesting to see Hun Sen actively posting selfies on his
[timeline](https://www.facebook.com/hunsencambodia/?fref=ts), it should not
distract us from urging the government to be more tolerant of dissenting
views.
