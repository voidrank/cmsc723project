Syria just announced that it was [ready to put its chemical weapons stockpile
under international control](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/russia-syria-push-
un-chemical-experts-return) – and then destroy them, under a new deal chalked
by Russia. Activists say the tactic will buy Syrian president Bashar Al Assad
time to continue killing people with all other types of weapons at his
disposal.

The deal aims to avert a US strike against Syria, which is being accused of
using chemical weapons against Syrian people. According to
[figures](http://blogs.aljazeera.com/liveblog/topic/syria-153) by the United
Nations, at least 100,000 people have been killed and more than 2 million have
been forced to flee the country since anti-Assad protests started in March,
2011.

Syrian activist Shakeeb Al-Jabri exclaims:

> Essentially what was decided today is that you can shoot someone dead and
> escape punishment by handing over the gun when you're done.

Mauritanian activist Naser Weddady notes:

While Ghazal says that reigning in Assad's use of chemical warfare means that
all other weapons are acceptable [ar]:

> وهي وافقوا عالرقابة للكيماوي يعني منرجع للطيران والمدفعية والبراميل
> ..ومومشكلة يلي بيموتوا “ندين ..” بتتولى الموضوع اهم شي الكيماوي يتراقب !

> And now that they have accepted monitoring chemical weapons, it means that
> we will go back to airforce, artillery and barrels. It isn't a problem how
> many people die. They will condemn. The most important is that chemical
> weapons are not used.

In a series of tweets, BBC News Middle East Bureaux chief Richard Colebourn
suggests that Russia and Syria may have – obviously – coordinated their
action.

> [#Syria](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syria&src=hash) state TV have a

> Timings of statements from

He adds:

> Is [#Russia](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Russia&src=hash) deal a way out

The move is also posing many questions. Zeina Khodr, Al Jazeera English
correspondent, tweets:

> [#Syrians](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syrians&src=hash) now ask whether
> [#US](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23US&src=hash) threatened military
> action just to make sure CW stockpiles don't fall in the “wrong hands” (AQ

While Syrian blogger Anas Maarawi says:

> من وين طلعولنا بشغلة تسليم الكيماوي. النظام مستعد يسلّم أمه وأبوه وأخته
> والقرداحة نفسها مقابل أنو يبقى

> Where did they come up with handing over chemical weapons? The regime is
