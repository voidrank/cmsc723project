Amidst all the sad and violent news coming out of Yemen, the assassinations,
bomb explosions, US drone strikes and kidnappings, we managed to dig out a few
news items that you might have missed:

1\. After two years behind bars and no charge against them, some of Yemen's
revolution youth were
[released](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/06/yemens-revolution-jails-
its-youth/), although a few still remain in prison until this day.

2\. Journalist [Abdulillah Hayder Shaye](https://twitter.com/AbdulEla) who had
been [jailed](http://www.thenation.com/article/166757/why-president-obama-
keeping-journalist-prison-yemen) for almost three years, for exposing a [US
missile attack](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/yemen-images-
missile-and-cluster-munitions-point-us-role-fatal-attack-2010-06-04) on the
remote mountain village of Al-Ma'jallah, which killed 41 people, was released
and received the [Alkaramah Human Rights defenders

yemeni-journalist-to-receive-the-2013-alkarama-
award&catid=330:award&Itemid=226) but was not able to attend the ceremony in
Geneva to receive the award in person because he is [under house
arrest](http://www.alternet.org/world/yemeni-journalist-jailed-obamas-request-
now-under-house-arrest) and not allowed to leave the country.

Journalist Iona Craig and investigative journalist and author of “Drone Wars”
Jeremy Scahill received the award on his behalf.

3\. The Yemeni film “[Karamah Has No Walls](http://karamahasnowalls.com/)”
documenting the bloody events of March 18, 2011, in Yemen's revolution
directed by Yemeni/Scottish film director [Sara
Ishaq](https://twitter.com/yemyogini) was shortlisted for an
[Oscar](http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2013/20131010.html)
[nomination](http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&SubID=7303).
Karamah in Arabic means Dignity.

Here is the film:

Sarah Ishaq also directed the documentary film “[The Mulberry
House](http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=a82ea4d9-b5a0-476e-b00e-767a3b97fb25),”
which is being screened in international film festivals across the world.

4\. Launched successfully last year, [TedxSanaa](http://tedxsanaa.com/) held
another event this year under the theme [“Actions
Matter”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/13/yemenis-looking-for-action-
tedxsanaa-2013/) which was just as successful and
[TedxAden](http://tedxaden.com/en/) was launched on Dec 11, 2013. A lot of
effort and great organization was put into it, beginning with the creative
flash mob announcing it, to the inspiring panel of speakers and variety of
subjects it included.  

5\. Kidnapped Dutch couple, journalist Judith Spiegel and her partner
Boudewijn Berendsen, were [finally and safely
released](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dutch-couple-freed-abductors-yemen-0)
after six months in captivity. They were unharmed and said they received good
treatment from their abductors. Judith said on her first [Facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dutchcallingforreleasejudithboudewijn/permalink/470787746365725/)
after her release:

> Yes yes yes we are free! We are very fine. We will contact you all soon, but
> for now: thank you so so so much for all the support. You cannot believe how
> fantastic that has been and still is for our families and us. We love you
> and we still love Yemen

6\. On December 15, Yemen's parliament passed a [law
banning](http://news.yahoo.com/yemen-parliament-bans-drone-
attacks-194832509.html;_ylt=A2KJ3CSWCa5S7QIAa9fQtDMD) drone strikes. The
country has been subjected to continuous [US drone
strikes](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/drones-
yemen/) for years and recently a drone strike [killed 17 civilians in a
wedding convoy](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/if-a-
drone-strike-hit-an-american-wedding-wed-ground-our-fleet/282373/) in Yemen.
Yes, it sounds like good news, but it was just a symbolic gesture since
Yemen's lawmakers have limited powers, especially when the country's own
president [endorsed the
drones](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/10/02/yemen-the-presidents-
speech/) and there are no signs that they would stop anytime soon.

7\. [ A road map was finally reached for resolving the “southern”
issue](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemen-agrees-political-
map-21323791). Some autonomy was granted to the Southern regions in Yemen in
the face of the secessionist movement which had been calling for an end to the
[unity between North and South
Yemen](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/05/24/yemen-marks-unification-
anniversary-as-south-marches-for-independence/), which took place in 1990. A
committee formed by President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi will choose between
forming two regions in the south and four in the north, or two large entities,
a northern and southern one.

It is too soon to determine whether this last bit of news is good or bad, but
we are keeping it with the positive spirit of the post and hoping to hear more
good news from Yemen in the next year!
