Hundreds of Kurdish political prisoners have entered an indefinite hunger
strike, challenging Turkey's treatment of Kurdish political prisoners. Through
their protest, some are demanding re-trials and language rights while others
want to raise international attention about Turkey's treatment of Kurdish
political prisoners. Despite their hunger strike, which is nearing six weeks,
international media outlets have largely remained silent. This is not
particularly surprising, since domestic media outlets in Turkey have both
ignored the hunger strikes, and refused to report on them.

A Kurdish blogger explains how the protests began. Memed Boran, currently
residing in London, [says](http://apogeeculture.blogspot.se/2012/10/the-33rd-
day.html?spref=tw&m=1);

> On 12th September 2012, nine women prisoners in Diyarbakir E type prison

> they highlighted two demands: the right to use their Kurdish mother tongue
> in the public sphere, including court and the removal of obstacles
> preventing imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan from negotiating in

The number of Kurdish political prisoners is unknown, but according to Human
Rights agencies there are thousands of political prisoners in Turkey, and this
had led activists to believe that all of them, or rather significant number of
them are on hunger strike.

Istanbul says the media has chosen to ignore Kurds on hunger strike, and that
many of them may soon die.

One Pro-Kurdish rights activist, who tweets under
[@Hevallo](https://twitter.com/Hevallo/status/258298145287593985) has been
desperately trying to get people on Twitter to send Vitamin B1 tablets to the
prisoners on hunger strike, in an attempt to minimise the damage to their
bodies, and the potentially inevitable consequence, death.

Hunger strikes are a form of non-violent protest, and despite the ongoing and
large number of hunger strikers, Turkish media has willfully ignored their
plight, perhaps hoping that through their silence the international human
rights agencies will also follow a similar path. The lack of interviews with
prisoners on hunger strikes has facilitated a justification for media outlets
to ignore it, particularly journalists who complain about the lack of
resources available.
