Egyptians are back to the streets after a court
[acquitted](http://www.madamasr.com/opinion/politics/qa-mubarak-trial-
verdict-%E2%80%93-what-just-happened) former president Hosni Mubarak of
killing protestors during the January 25 revolution against his regime.
Charges were also dropped against Mubarak and his co-defendants, who included
Interior Minister Habib Eladly and his two sons, in relation to corruption
charges linked to a gas deal with Israel.

In the 18 days Mubarak remained in power after the start of anti-regime
protests, some 900 protestors are estimated to have been killed by regime
forces and thousands more arrested until he finally stepped down in February
2011. Mubarak, 86, has since spent around three and a half years in detention,
mostly well-cared for at hospitals, under different charges.

According to [Mada Masr](http://www.madamasr.com/news/mubarak-cleared-all-
charges-including-conspiring-kill-protesters), the judge in today's trial
dismissed charges against Mubarak “citing a procedural error by the
prosecutors.”

The progressive bilingual news site adds:

> Mubarak was not originally a defendant in the case and prosecutors did not
> add him to the case until two months after it was filed. This, to the judge,
> showed that the prosecution had implied “there were no grounds for criminal
> proceedings” against Mubarak.

The Mubarak trial saga has had its ups and downs, but today's verdict seems to
be like one of the final straws Egyptians can take. Despite being muzzled by a
controversial anti-protest law which has seen the jailing of countless
protestors, Egyptians enraged at the judgement took to the streets to vent
off.

Tahrir Square, the epi-centre of the Egyptian revolution, was off-limits,
walled by barbed wire and armed personnel when checked people's ID cards.
Clashes took place nearby as more protestors gathered to decry the verdict.

Very soon, the crackdown begins. Blogger Omar Elhadi, with 136K followers on
Twitter, provides the run down of events today:

> والخرطوش وقبض عليهم

On Twitter, reactions continued to pour in throughout the day. In his first
television interview, Mubarak
[claims](https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjKaBh8HcvA) he has not committed
anything wrong. Johnathan Moremi reminds him:

Hind, a Libyan blogger with more than 31K followers, says what Egypt needs to
end the stalemate .. is a revolution.

> Rampant corruption, crackdown on civil society, opaque judicial system, no
