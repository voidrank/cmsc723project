Protests are continuing across Syria, as the Syrian regime shows no signs of
loosening its brutal crackdown despite an international outcry.

On Twitter, netizens continue to follow and react to developments on the
ground. Dima Khatib
[writes](https://twitter.com/#!/Dima_Khatib/status/80928257268121600):

> People flee their homes before the army of their OWN country reaches their
> towns —- only in Syria. So sad ! #syria #mar15

In another tweet she mocks the Arab League, a political bloc for leaders of
the 22 Arab countries, who have just [issued their first
statement](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/14/arab-league-
condemnation-syria-violence?CMP=twt_fd) regarding Syria since the violent
crackdown on protesters started last March. Khatib
[tweets](https://twitter.com/#!/Dima_Khatib/status/80698407190142976):

> Arab League finally turned on the TV to watch the news ! #Syria Just 3
> months, 10000 refugees & 1000++ killed LATE ! #mar15
