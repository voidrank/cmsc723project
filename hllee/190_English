In early August 2011, the Ministry of Culture of Kazakhstan
[developed](http://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/193980/) [ru] a draft law to
introduce some amendments into the state's language policy. It was quickly
labeled by many observers as a move to further reduce the scope of use of the
Russian language, which enjoys equal status with the Kazakh language,
according to the Constitution.

The new move was supposed to make all interactions that citizens have with the
government bodies to be in Kazakh, as well as all internal documentation of
the state structures. All visual and business-related information (adverts,
signs, price lists, forms etc.) was also meant to be provided solely in
Kazakh. The changes were set to be introduced in 2013.

The gradual move to the state-language documentation has been taking place in
Kazakhstan for several years, but most often comes to the situations when
people are using Kazakh translations (at times, very poorly made) to observe
the formality, but use Russian to keep the things going.

User Russky (a Russian) [leaves a
comment](http://www.zakon.kz/kazakhstan/4445031-nacionalisty-khotjat-
osushhestvit.html#) to the news article [ru]:

> Everybody – with no exception – should study Kazakh, but it should not turn

> the other shouts “No way” (although even saying that they understand that it

Jelsomino [agrees](http://www.zakon.kz/kazakhstan/4445031-nacionalisty-
khotjat-osushhestvit.html#) that before you require people to use the
language, you should give them a chance to study it [ru]:

> I am a Russian-speaking Kazakh, studied in the Russian-language high school
> (in Soviet times there was no other option with only two Kazakh schools in
> Almaty, the former capital and the largest city of Kazakhstan)… Russian
> language was everywhere – on the street, on a TV, routinely. Kazakh language
> was taught very badly in schools, because nobody really used it in urban
> environment. Now the times are changing, rural population us urbanizing,
> many Russian-speaking people left the country. So, what shall the
> generations of Soviet descent do? Right, we must study Kazakh. But how?
> Courses are largely unaffordable, textbooks are of low quality, multimedia
> CDs only start to appear, but they are expensive too… I can speak simple
> Kazakh in everyday life, but if officials require me to communicate with
> them only in Kazakh, I would consider it that the government turned its back

pondering on another possible consequence [ru]:

> Such radical measures will once again lead to major brain-drain, as
> qualified specialists who don't know the state language – but do possess
> expertise – would flee the country. Remember the 1990s, when almost every

> “historic motherlands” […]

Megakhuimyak [offers a look](
http://megakhuimyak.livejournal.com/1056341.html) from a different perspective
– why such an initiative appeared as all [ru]:

> I will not speak about the draft law's contradiction to the constitution
> (who cares about it – our parliament is notoriously known for being able to
> change the constitution in half of an hour). The more interesting question
> is why. When the presidential administration found that the Kazakh-language
> newspapers (subject to control by the Minister of Culture) publish anti-
> president appeals, the Ministry was squeezed, and its mandate of controlling
> the media was given to the Ministry of Communications. After the extremist
> outbreak in Western Kazkahstan, it turned out that the Ministry failed to
> succeed I this direction too – and the Committee for Religions was taken out
> of the Ministry… Thus, the minister of culture found himself deprived of
> both Realpolitik leverages – media and religions. Now all he's got is
> culture, NGOs and language. That hurts – and the Ministry decided to take on
> a new agenda at the expense of state language issue.
>
> The ado did not pass unnoticed. Controversial draft law was pretty quickly
> repelled by the Ministry – officials did not insist too earnestly on the
> initiative, but indicated that they were not very pleased with the tone of
> public debate. The passions calmed down, but the problem persists.
