Last night [four people were injured in a
clash](http://www.politics.hu/20110427/four-injured-in-clash-between-
nationalists-and-roma-in-north-hungary-village) between ethnic Hungarian
members of the far-right group _Véderő_ and members of the Roma community in
Gyöngyöspata. [Tensions have been
escalating](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/19/hungary-waiting-for-the-
hungarian-guard/) in this northern Hungarian village since March. By last
Friday, _Véderő_ ‘s show-off [military training tipped the scales of the
conflict](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/24/hungary-for-gyongyospatas-
roma-evacuation-or-an-easter-excursion/) against making peace between the
local Roma and Hungarian communities.

Contradictory accounts have been published in the Hungarian media about how
exactly the fight started – and neither of the communities has taken
responsibility for the clash.

_Gyöngyöspata Solidarity_ blog shared [a
translation](http://gyongyospatasolidarity.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/via-index-
bloody-fight-in-gyongyospata/) of the [_index.hu_ news
report](http://index.hu/belfold/2011/04/26/verekedes_gyongyospatan/) [hu].
János Ladó of the Roma Civil Rights Foundation told _index.hu_ the Hungarians
had been provoking the Roma community all day and this topped with the clash:

> […] By the evening, in the middle of a birthday celebration, the provocation
> increased, and more and more gathered on both sides. The Roma called the
> police, first one patrol arrived, then more policemen.
>
> While the crowd was gathering in the central areas of the town, some threw
> stones at the windows of one of the houses in the Roma neighbourhood, some
> 10 minutes walk from there, then assaulted a 14-year-old local Roma boy. A
> serious fight in the Roma neighbourhood followed; according to Ladó, some
> were seriously injured, he saw three. Police called for more police backup.
> This was also confirmed by representative of TASZ [HCLU- Hungarian Civil
> Liberties Union] who saw a group of police cars on the highway, on their way
> to Gyöngyöspata. […]

Gábor Vona, the leader of the far-right Jobbik party in the Hungarian
Parliament, criticized the way in which the Minister of the Interior, Sándor
Pintér, responded to the situation in northern Hungary, [calling for the
minister's resignation](http://www.politics.hu/20110427/nationalist-leader-
calls-for-resignation-of-interior-minister-over-roma-situation) because he
hadn't been able to protect the Hungarian citizens from the Roma who “keep the
whole village, mostly the elderly, in constant terror.”

_Egyenlítő blog_ reported that Mr. Vona also invited PM Viktor Orbán for a
dialogue about the Hungarian-Roma relations. The blogger drew quite a radical
conclusion in his
[post](http://egyenlito.blog.hu/2011/04/27/ket_het_ket_pofon) [hu]:

> […] The problem is just that along with verbal slaps there are more and more
> real conflicts [happening]. In the meantime, the government makes some
> constitution, some media law, [and] educates Europe. […] Nicely [getting]
> back to the [1930s]. And, sadly, every sign says the [1940s] will be
> following them again.
>
> Or there's another opportunity: in two weeks from now, the security of our
> country could highly increase if Mr. Orbán and Mr. Pintér resigned.
