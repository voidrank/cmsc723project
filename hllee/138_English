From mainstream news headlines it seems Iran and Israel are on the edge of
war. Israeli politicians continue to
[threaten](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/israel-plans-for-iran-
strike-as-citizens-say-government-serious.html) attacking Iranian nuclear
facilities and Iranian authorities
[recite](http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=281366) their
old slogans that Israel will ‘disappear from the map.’

But as the noise of war rises from both sides, so does activism for peace.

Recently, Israelis
[demonstrated](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/israel-plans-for-iran-
strike-as-citizens-say-government-serious.html) for peace in their capital
city of Tel Aviv and used the Internet to send a ‘no to war’ message.

Israeli-Loves-Iran Facebook campaign.

Peace lovers also continue to join a [Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/israellovesiran) that was launched on March 19,
2012 by Israeli Pushpin Mehina (also known as Ronny) that tells Iranians,
‘[Israelis love you and will not bomb your
country.](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/18/a-love-letter-from-israel-
to-iran/)‘ The page currently has more than 70,000 likes. On the same day,
Iranians launched the Facebook page ‘[From Iran for Peace and
Democracy](https://www.facebook.com/FromIranForPeaceAndDemocracy)‘, which soon
started a campaign to tell Israelis, “[We are your
friends](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/21/iranians-to-israelis-we-
are-your-friends/).”

Both campaigns came together again when the

On Wednesday, August 16th, over 400 people, including university professors
and human rights defenders, signed an online petition [calling
](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hundreds-of-israelis-petition-
idf-pilots-refuse-orders-to-bomb-iran.premium-1.458517)on Israeli pilots to
refuse to bomb Iran, if they are ordered to do so.

The online petition [reads](http://www.atzuma.co.il/tayasim):

> the pilots we regard a decision to launch an attack on Iran as a highly
> mistaken gamble, which would entail severe risks for the State of Israel and
> would not solve the basic problem. As already mentioned, even the best
> operational success would not stop the Iranian nuclear program but only
> delay it – and for this temporary delay all of us would have to pay an
> exorbitant price, possibly a terrible one. You, the Air Force pilots – more
> than anyone else – have in your hands the real power to avert this disaster.
