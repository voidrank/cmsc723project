A few do-or-die matches to qualify for the 2014 World Cup were played
worldwide last week in Africa and Europe. Despite the of-repeated claim that
those games are just that, games, how people behave before and after some
matches show that there is a little more at stake that what everyone would
like it to be.

Here are reactions caught on film from four of those deciding matches, which
ended in complete elation for Algeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon and France,
while Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ukraine and Tunisia saw their hopes of heading to
Brazil vanish with the final whistle.

**Algeria vs. Burkina Faso**

Algeria qualified thanks to a late goal scored on Burkina Faso in additional
time.

The crowd in Algiers felt the World Cup fever, as seen in this photo by
Twitter user Bilel.:

The tension during the first leg of the match-up on October 12 led some
supporters to resort to racial insults towards the black referee, as captured
in these screenshots by Paulin Diasivi:

**Côte d'Ivoire vs. Senegal**

Côte d'Ivoire was also involved in late game drama when they managed to tie
Senegal in Dakar 1-1 to qualify. The joy was visible in the team's dance as
the game came to an end:

**Cameroon vs. Tunisia**

Cameroon's World Cup play-off win over Tunisia was less dramatic with a 4-1
victory. Still, there was a bit controversy as Tunisia claims that [two
Cameroonian players were not eligible](http://t.co/Mt5POqYZKE) to play.
Yaoundé, the economic capital of Cameroon, nevertheless was still beaming with
pride after the win:

Given the political dissidence in Tunisia, some supporters may not be as sad
as expected with the elimination of their national team. The current
government is quite unpopular within the country's secular community because
of stricter religious measures, and a win for the country's football team
could have been seen as a win for the government :

**France vs. Ukraine**

France had the deepest hole to climb out of to qualify after they lost the
first leg 2-0 against Ukraine. In an miraculous come back, France won 3-0 in
the second leg of the match-up, prompting raucous celebration from French fans
and shows of despair from Ukrainian supporters:
