Winter is coming to Gaza, where some 100,000 people have been left homeless.
On Twitter,
[@NourAlghussein](https://twitter.com/NourAlGhussein/status/515911848042844160)
says: “winter is on the doors here .and Gaza is still besieged >there's no

After the [intense
destruction](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/gaza-civilian-
death-toll-mounts-in-israeli-offensive/) caused by [this summer's
war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict),
thousands of Gazans are left with insufficient resources to brave winter's
coming cold.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
[reported](http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_protection_of_civilians_weekly_report_2014_10_17_english.pdf)
in October 2014 that an estimated 20,000 homes were destroyed, displacing
100,000 people. Refugees either live with host families or in collective
centers, like schools.

On Twitter, the first rains of autumn spurred concern for the refugees’
future.

In an article entitled, “No Shelter from Winter Rain for Thousands in Gaza,”
collective blog Electronic Intifada _‘s_ Rami Almeghari
[reported](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/nora-barrows-friedman/no-
shelter-winter-rains-thousands-gaza):

> […] hundreds of families whose homes were bombed by Israel lack basic
> infrastructure, including electricity and access to water, and remain in
> metal caravan shelters or at United Nations-run schools. Heavy rainstorms
> have recently swept through Gaza, further damaging the electricity, water
> and sewage networks.
>
> “These people had no chance to be safe during the rains … it’s alarming for
> the whole population of the Gaza Strip, particularly those who have been
> displaced. The winter will be a difficult time for these residents,” [The
> Electronic Intifada's Rami] Almeghari explained
>
> Though international donors have promised reconstruction aid, the physical
> process of reconstruction has not yet started. “These people have been
> waiting since the war ended in August for the reconstruction to take place,”
> Almeghari said

Numerous crowdsourced donation campaigns have also arisen. A selection of
these are as follows.

An Indiegogo [campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/make-gaza-children-
s-winter-warmer) by the Al-Rahma Society will provide winter clothing to
refugee children. At time of writing, more than US$3,300 had been pledged of
the $5,000 sought in funding:

> Make Gaza children's winter warmer is the name of our campaign in which we
> advertise our message for the world to donate for our campaign, we try to
> collect money to buy the clothes for the children. When we receive any money
> we will start making deals with clothes stores, and prepare cards for the
> children to come and choose their needs. We will try to offer 50$ for each
> child.

On Go Get Funding, a user only identified as Abu Yazan has established a
campaign called [Help Gaza This Winter](http://gogetfunding.com/project/help-
gaza-this-winter#), raising $1,871 so far. The author writes:

> Winter is coming for Gaza and this year its different than the years before.
> Winter this year will be hard since thousands of houses in Gaza are totally
> or partially destroyed and over 100,000 Palestinians are left homeless… This
> is an initiative to help these people out during the winter, to warm them,
> to protect them from the rain & expected floods and to reinforce their
> steadfastness in these hard times.

The campaign appears to be associated with [Gaza Youth Breaks
Out](https://www.facebook.com/GazaYBO/info?ref=page_internal), an anonymous
Palestinian youth group that describes itself on Facebook as a “political
party,” as it links to them on the campaign page and they promote the project
in this tweet:

> Winter in [#Gaza](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gaza?src=hash) will be hard
> and your help is needed.. Please retweet. <http://t.co/LHzlQYqOec>

The Save Gaza Project is running two simultaneous campaigns on [Go Fund
Me](http://www.gofundme.com/eaxz5w) and
[Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/1-000-school-bags-for-
palestinian-children-in-gaza#home). On Indiegogo, the campaign to provide
backpacks and school supplies to children has raised 9,800 British pounds
(about US$14,800) of its 15,000-pound goal, and on Go Fund Me, it has raised
5,200 pounds, 200 pounds over its original goal. The organization works in
coordination with the Al-Tawheed Society in Gaza to distribute funds.

On Facebook, Palestine Loves Israel encourages donations to Gaza through
Caritas, a [well-respected
](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=12721#.VE6f5IvLceQ)international
aid organization,
[writing](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=558957857537223&id=209640082469004):

During Israel's offensive in Gaza, 40 percent of Gaza's urban area was reduced
to rubble, according to some estimates. Israel attacked the only power plant
in Gaza on July 28, plunging the congested strip of 1.8 million people into
darkness while putting its limited water and sanitation infrastructure under
crippling stress.

On August 26, 2014, Israel and the Palestinian factions agreed to halt
fighting indefinitely, putting an end to seven weeks of catastrophic
destruction and loss of life. At least 2,100 Palestinians were killed, more
than 10,500 injured, and 520,000 displaced during Israel ‘s massive offensive
Protective Edge against the 40-kilometer-long coastal strip.
