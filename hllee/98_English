Journalist Jenan Moussa is back in Aleppo, Syria, tweeting her experiences as
the war between pro- and anti-government forces intensifies. Moussa's tweets
are raw and personal, giving readers a snippet of what life is like for those
caught in the crossfire.

Moussa, who is a roving reporter for Arabic Al Aan TV, Dubai, UAE, observes:

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/320957941949796354):
> Its great to be back in #Aleppo & meet all my friends. City seems much
> better than last time I was here. People adapted to war.

Dinner, in Aleppo, is accompanied by the sounds of mortars falling in the
distance:

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/320978310303739904):
> It's dinner time here in #Aleppo. We are having Mexicana chicken as sound of
> mortars echoes at a distance.

After a night in the city, Moussa wonders:

> [@jenanmoussa:](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/321174982354931713)
> Morning from #Aleppo. I couldn't sleep till 6 am. Everytime I closed my eyes
> I imagined bombs falling. God, how do ppl stay sane?

In Aleppo, she visits the site where a Scud missile fell some 45 days earlier.
She tweets:

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/321264682243600384):
> Earlier today I went to site where SCUD missile fell 45 days ago in #Aleppo.
> 6 bodies are still missing under rubble

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/321265990438621185):
> In #Aleppo I saw a father sitting on rubble, tears in his eyes. He's still
> looking for bodies of his 2 beautiful daughters & wife

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/321269697410658307):
> While I was w/ him, father found slippers of a child & handful of hair (
> woman's hair) under rubble. ‘Maybe it's my wife’ he told me

Despite the stressful situation, Moussa maintains her humour:

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/321359564559769600):
> Activists here in #Aleppo laugh at me. I am sometimes only one wearing my
> flak jacket in house. They are used to the sounds of war.

And then goes to sleep without dinner:

> [@jenanmoussa:](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/321387276347248640)
> We didn't have dinner tonight. Also no shower. Not a necessity in a city
> like #Aleppo. Good night you all.
