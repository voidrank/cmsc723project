In the past few days, racism and Nazism have become popular subjects on the
Bulgarian web. The actions of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy against the
Roma people in France and [their deportation to Bulgaria and
Romania](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11027288), were met with two
opposing views in the Bulgarian society. On one side there were those who
defended Sarkozy, and then there were those who believed the Roma people's
basic rights as human beings had been violated.

Nationalist factions in Bulgaria organized an anti-Roma protest on Sept. 25,
where they chanted Nazi slogans and praised Nazi actions. This evoked a
response from human rights activists, who created a website and Facebook
groups against the actions of neo-Nazi groups in Bulgaria.

This is one of those sites: <http://stopnazi-bg.blogspot.com/>.

Here's what people wrote on [their Facebook

> **Nikolay Peshterniakov:** Please, let's not turn this initiative into a

Members of another group – [“The Bulgarian Anti-Racism
Movement“](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=349311297053&ref=ts) write:

User _Grazhdanin_ (“citizen”)
[writes](http://bulgaria.indymedia.org/article/37014) about the nature of
Bulgarian Nazi groups on the alternative site _Indymedia_ :

> There are close analogies and connections between the Bulgarian neo-Nazis
> and their “colleagues” in Europe – whether it's ideological imitation, or
> joint actions. Bulgarians from the “National Resistance” movement (a group
> that broke away from the BNA party, led by Boyan Rassate at the time) try to
> imitate the German “autonomous nationalists” both in rhetoric (by copying
> their slogans like “Free, Social, National) and in style – casual clothes,
> dressing in all-black when going to political events, etc. The “BNS Guard”
> group is a member of the “European National Front” – a pan-European union of
> neo-Nazi political movements like the Deutsches Kollegе (German college),
> NPD (National-Democratic party) and the Freier Widerstand (Free Resistance),
> the Belgian Vlaams Blok (Flemmish bloc), the Spanish La Falange (Phalanx),
> created by the dictator Franco, the French Guarde Franque (Frank Guard), the
> Romanian Noua Dreapta (New Right) and the Dutch Nationale Alliantie
> (National
> Alliance)(http://www.bghelsinki.org/index.php?module=pages&lg=bg&…12905).
> Guests from German, Romanian, Italian and Swiss fascist organizations often
> attend neo-Nazi gatherings.

On Oct. 2, bTV aired a documentary on nationalism in Bulgaria. It examined the
groups, the young people who belong to those groups, as well as the
possibility of ethnic conflict in Bulgaria if nothing is done about the
current situation.
