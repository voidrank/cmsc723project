Although outnumbered by the Bengali population, the close to one million
indigenous and aboriginal population of Bangladesh live mainly in the
[Chittagong Hill Tracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts).
Over the years they have become vulnerable minorities.

During the 1970s and 80s, the government took steps to resettle Bengali
homeless people in the three hilly districts of Bangladesh. There were
resistances and insurgency by the local indigenous people and these previously
tourist places became a protected militarized zone.

For decades Bengali settlers and soldiers have been accused of human rights
violations against the tribal minorities while members of the Shanti Bahini
and other rebel indigenous groups have committed similar violations, including
the massacre of unarmed Bengali settlers. The 1997 Peace Treaty with Shanti
Bahini granted a limited level of autonomy and stemmed the violence but the
problem was not solved.

Recently ethnic violences sparked again and [news media
reported](http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/90045232?Four%20killed%2C%20scores%20hurt%20in%20ethnic%20clash%20in%20Bangladesh%20hills)
that four Bengali settlers were killed and 50 others were injured in Ramgarh
on Sunday April 17, 2011. According to a statement by [Amnesty
International](http://chtnewsupdate.blogspot.com/2011/04/amnesty-
international-public-statement.html):

> The latest round of tensions began on 14 April when a group of Bengali
> settlers occupied and tried to plant crops on areas within the Jumma’s
> ancestral lands, in Khagrachari District in south-eastern Bangladesh. After
> three Bengali settlers were killed on 17 April, allegedly by Jumma people,
> settlers looted surrounding indigenous villages and injured people, burning
> at least 60 homes.
>
> Indigenous sources say they informed the local authorities – including the
> army, which has a heavy presence in the area – of the settlers’ movements,
> but they failed to act on the information.

The voices of the indigenous people are rarely heard in the mainstream media
but through the Internet – blogs and Facebook – they have found a platform
from which to be heard. In the Facebook group [_CHT
Voice_](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_150002018385535&ap=1) people
have been wondering why only the casualties of Bengali settlers are being
reported. _Radhamon_ wrote:

A new blog called [_CHT News
Update_](http://chtnewsupdate.blogspot.com/2011/04/bangladeshi-media-and-
ramgarh-communal.html) has this question:

> Bangladeshi mainstream media has been overflown with biased news about
> Ramgarh incident. The journalists try to retain objectivity in their news.
> However, all news articles are being filtered by the security forces before
> they get published and thus the public is not made aware of the real story.
> If you look at the the Bangladeshi dailies, you will see news and pictures

Blogger and journalist Biplob Rahman writes at the [Indigenous Bangla
Blog](http://w4study.com/?p=1446) [bn]:

_Unheard Voice_ [blog posts](http://unheardvoice.net/blog/2011/04/18/cht-3/) a
round up of mainstream media news and also some news, images and video
obtained via email.

Another blog _CHTBD.Net_ is [reporting](http://chtbd.net/2011/04/19/ramgarh-
attacks-latest-count-says-total-houses-burnt-95-4-indigenous-persons-are-
confirmed-missing/) that the number of houses of locals burnt are 95, and 4
indigenous persons are confirmed missing. In an interview Polen Chakma
[describes](http://chtbd.net/2011/04/21/how-i-escaped-from-the-clutches-of-
death-is-indescribable-polen-chakma/) how he escaped death on April 17.

_Anandi Kalyan_ quotes one of her friend's Facebook messages to
[describe](http://www.sachalayatan.com/anandi_kalyan/38588) [bn] how these
incidents are accumulating hatred against Bengalis amongst the indigenous
people:

> There are unrests in the hills for decades. Let alone the statistics quoted
> in the media, I know from personal connections that my indigenous friends
> are victims one way or another. When I went to visit places like Bandarban,
> Rangamati, Teknaf and Cox's Bazar I saw that many businesses and settlements
> are owned by Bengalis. Those who are aboriginal there are cornered now. The
> hills have become agitated yet again and we are reading reports on attacks
> against Bengali settlers. The repressions against the indigenous people are
> being blacked out.
>
> When I speak with my aboriginal friends hatred are forming inside them
> because of our land grabbing mentality. My friend, who remained apolitical
> over the years now also think of armed resistance.
>
> We should not only think about the Chittagong Hill Tracts as an ‘awesome’
> touristic place. To what extent we think about the well beings of the
> indigenous people living there?
