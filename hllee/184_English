Is the pen really mightier than the sword? Or, in today's age, is the keyboard
greater than the laser-sighted assault rifle? For some purposes, the answer is
yes. Whether seeking to inflame passions, discredit an individual, or simply
reshape the debate, powerful interests have often eschewed coercion and
instead planted false or misleading stories in the press to transform public
opinion. Just ask the United States military. In 2005, the Pentagon –
desperate to capture the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people – paid millions
to Iraqi newspapers [ to ensure that pro-American stories would appear in the
Iraqi press](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/30/world/fg-infowar30).

These techniques of misinformation and misdirection are particularly
widespread across Russia. Drawing on a rich tradition of [“political
technology”](http://www.opendemocracy.net/andrew-wilson/political-technology-
why-is-it-alive-and-flourishing-in-former-ussr) honed under both the Tsarist
and Soviet police states, the Russian media are now rife with paid stories (
_vbros_ ) planted to advance specific agendas. The smoke and mirrors
characterizing Russian public life is often unimaginably difficult for the
outsider to decipher. Consider, for instance, Mikhail Prokhorov's recent
departure from his leadership of the political party Right Cause: [numerous
versions are possible](http://www.agoodtreaty.com/2011/09/16/the-strange-
death-of-liberal-russia/), including that the whole thing was stage-managed
from the beginning. No wonder Kremlinologists are so frequently wrong.

A recent example suggests this phenomenon reaches far further than the release
of pictures of politicians in bed with prostitutes or [false reports of
candidate deaths on the eve of an
election](http://putinwatcher.blogspot.com/2007/04/misinformation-black-
propaganda-and.html). Last Thursday, Vesti FM’s [Ksenia
Krikheli](http://www.radiomayak.ru/p/b_110.jpg) – a seemingly mild-mannered
journalist who normally covers local issues like schools – [published an
article](http://radiovesti.ru/articles/2011-09-15/fm/11130) [ru] on a small
Moscow suburb in Liubertsy called Krasnaya Gorka. In an article laced with
racial stereotypes and innuendo, Ms. Krikheli reported how local residents
were living in fear as their quiet suburb was being transformed into an
“African ghetto” overrun by an influx of unruly, violent, and sex-crazed
African migrants. Ms. Krikheli described a “local” population unable to sleep
and scared to venture onto the streets because of late night African drum
playing, African prostitution (women supposedly asking “3 rubles for sex”),
and criminal activity.

This article – which has spread across Russian online media – was followed by
[another article](http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=574025&574025). In this
follow-up article, Ms. Krikheli – clearly portraying herself as an
investigative journalist seeking to find the truth – reported visiting a
police station where a number of African migrants were being detained (in
response to her article, she mused). She then had the following to say:

> Не исключаю, помешала сотрудникам полиции еще и потому, что в участок на
> роскошном “Лексусе” как раз приехал африканский босс, видимо, выручать
> собратьев из плена. Уже возникли какие-то договоренности, и мой визит совсем
> некстати.  
>  Сотрудник полиции говорит африканцу: “Мы с вами свяжемся через 10-15 минут,
> обо всём договоримся”.

I cannot ignore the fact that it seemed that I was suddenly interfereing with
police work because an African boss soon pulled into the parking lot in a
luxurious Lexus to bail his brothers out of jail. Some kind of agreement had
already been worked out, it seemed, and the timing of my visit seemed
inopportune. The police officer said to the African boss, “Lets talk in about
10-15 minutes and figure out what to do.”

**Muckraking bloggers investigate these allegations**

As this news story spread across the Russian media landscape, prominent photo-
blogger Ilya Varlamov (LJ user zyalt) traveled to the “African Ghetto” [to
investigate](http://top.oprf.ru/blogs/156/4624.html) [ru]. In three hours of
interviews, he found nothing to support Ms. Krikheli's article. He did not
find a single person who had spoken with Ms. Krikheli. Furthermore, everyone
he spoke to denied having any problems with African migrants living in their
neighborhood.

For instance, one woman with three children said:

> «Нормально живется. Никаких проблем. . . А в соседнем доме живет Пьер
> Нарцисс, «Шоколадный заяц». Но вообще с ними никаких проблем нет — всегда
> здороваются, не шумят. Что-что? Ночью играют на барабанах во дворе и танцуют
> африканские танцы?! Бред какой-то, первый раз слышу. Наоборот, вообще
> никакого шума от них. У нас в школу ходит много их детей, все прекрасно
> ладят. Это вам какую-то чушь рассказали».

“Everything is fine. There are no problems. My neighbor is Pierre Narciss, the
“Chocolate Rabbit.” In general there are no problems with them – they are
always saying hello, and don't make much noise. What's that? At night they
play the drums and do African dances? Those are lies, that's the first I have
heard of this. On the contrary, there is absolutely no noise. Our school has a
number of African children and everyone gets along fine. What you have heard
about is absolute nonsense.”

Terrorized by an Influx of African Migrants? Photo by Ilya

Ilya also spoke with a local African migrant from South Africa who had moved
to Moscow to manage a nightclub. He was clearly worried about the effects of
the article:

> Было видно, что к прессе у него очень подозрительное отношение. . . «Мы
> собираемся подавать в суд на них», — заявил он. «Они все переврали. Здесь
> живет много африканцев из разных стран, и все всегда жили спокойно, а они
> там наговорили непонятно что. Я не понимаю, зачем надо так врать».

It was clear he had a very negative view of the press. “We intend to take them
to court,” he said. “They have distorted everything. Many Africans from
different countries live here, and we have always lived peacefully, and then
they write this stuff. I do not understand why they would do this.”

**Why would Vesti-FM publish this kind of nonsense?**

If the fair residents of this quiet suburb were not terrorized, what could
possibly motivate Ms. Krikheli and Vesti FM to print this kind of racist
misinformation? As Varlamov poses it:

> зачем серьезной государственной радиокомпании надо раздувать абсолютно
> несуществующую в реальности проблему? Да еще описывать все в таких страшных
> красках? Ради сенсации? И как у журналистки, готовившей материал, обстоит
> дело с журналистской этикой? Слышала ли она об ответственности за разжигание
> межнациональной розни?

For what reason would a serious government radio station need to fabricate a
nonexistent problem? And to paint it in such vivid color? Just to create a
sensation? And doesn't a journalist, preparing material, have professional
ethics? Has she heard about responsibility for stirring up inter-ethnic
conflict?

Although it is unlikely that a definitive answer will ever emerge from the
murky world of Russian misinformation, one strong possibility is that this
series of articles were paid for by wealthy interests (one possibility:
construction companies) who have an interest in deflecting anti-immigration
attitudes toward African migrants. There are some clues in Ms. Khrikeli's
articles themselves. At one point, she writes:

> Анастасия говорит, что жизнь рядом с мигрантами из стран СНГ ни в какое
> сравнение не идет – они просто ангелы на фоне африканского народа,
> заполонившего подмосковные Люберцы. “Что вы, таджики и узбеки – тихие,
> спокойные, никогда не собираются большими компаниями, не шумят. Африканцы же
> всегда после себя столько мусора оставляют. Очень плохо мы живем здесь”, –
> отмечает она.

Anastasia says that there is no comparison between these African immigrants
and life next to migrants from the CIS countries [former Soviet republics like
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan] – they are simply angels in comparison with the
African people, who are overrunning the Liubertsy suburbs. “The Tajiks and
Uzbeks are quiet, peaceful, never congregate in big groups, and do not make a
lot of noise. The Africans are always leaving trash everywhere. It is awful
living here.”

Articles around the web have appeared which further support this explanation.
One article on [Islam News proclaims](http://www.islamnews.ru/news-85461.html)
that the residents of Liubertsy “now sorely miss living next to Tajiks and
Uzbeks.”

A great deal still remains unclear. Since Vesti FM is state-owned, what role
did the Russian government play in these articles? Whatever the explanation,
however, Ms. Krikheli's articles are a sad reflection on the state of
journalistic ethics in the state-owned Russian media as well as the ease with
which it is manipulated. For the African immigrants of Liubertsy, let's hope
that the ramifications end there.
