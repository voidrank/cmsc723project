A bomb blast, believed to have originated from a car bomb, has killed at least
28 people and injured scores in what appears to be a targeted attack on
vehicles carrying Turkish military personnel.

The explosion comes amid an intensification of fighting between Turkey's army
and the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has seen the government
conduct regular and sweeping raids on Kurdish-populated areas in the country's
east.

The city's governor confirmed the casualties from the blast that went off a
short walk from the Turkish parliament.

The government has not yet apportioned blame for the attack.

This is the second major blast that Ankara, the country's second largest city,
has experienced in recent times.

In October 2015 over a hundred died after [two bombs went
off](https://globalvoices.org/2015/10/10/at-least-86-killed-in-explosions-at-
ankara-peace-rally/) at a rally held to protest fresh violence between Turkey
and the PKK.

The government suggested the ISIS militant group in control of vast swathes of
Iraq and Syria was responsible for the purported suicide attack.

Earlier this year, the historic district of Sultanahmet in Istanbul was struck
by suicide bombers the government also linked to ISIS. A total of 12 people
died in the attack.

With bombings a disturbingly regular occurrence in Turkey since hostilities
with PKK recommenced and Ankara waded into the conflict in Syria and Iraq last
year, many Turks were bracing for more bad news on the night of February 17.
