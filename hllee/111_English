Barack Obama was sworn in for a second term as President of the United States
yesterday [Jan 21, 2013]. Ironically while the crowd was cheering his
inauguration line “A decade of war is now ending”, more than [three drone
strikes](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/21/us-yemen-violence-usa-
idUSBRE90K0AB20130121) hit Yemen, killing suspected militants and what Reuters
described as “Qaeda-linked militants” (whatever that means), some of whose
bodies were [charred beyond
recognition](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/uk-yemen-qaeda-
idUKBRE90M1HE20130123).

Adam Baron, a freelance journalist based in Yemen, tweeted:

With Obama's inauguration on MLK Day, I find it important to note how much
King would be protesting our nation's first Black President. From drone
bombings to Guantanamo to warrantless wire-tapping, surveillance of U.S.
citizens, and increased deportations, the Obama administration is not the
change we want to see in this world, it is the problem,

Monday, January 21, was also Martin Luther King's Day – the great man who in
1967 said “When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided
missiles and misguided men.” Many tweeps shared the tweet saying that while
King had a dream, Obama has a drone.

Immortal Tech drew the analogy between the two leaders:

> Americans on it but you can't see it or know how you there.”

Although Obama pledged to end the “war on terror” and to restore respect for
the rule of law in US counter-terrorism policies, the use of drones has
dramatically increased during his time in office.

Glenn Greenwald, a columnist and blogger for the Guardian, tweeted:

Just a day after Obama had won the re-election, [US drones hit
Yemen](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/11/08/yemen-drones-a-day-after-
obama-won/) – a move which was translated as four more years of drones for the
country. With the nomination of the Drone Czar John Brennan to head the CIA,
the drones are likely to increase as well. It is worth pointing that their
effectiveness has been greatly debated in eradicating Al-Qaeda in Yemen, whose
members have increased since 2009. US drones have certainly been [breeding
anger](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-29/world/35456187_1_aqap-
drone-strikes-qaeda) and resentment towards the US administration.
