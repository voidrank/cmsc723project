On July 28, exactly three months ahead of the [Oct. 28 parliamentary
election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2012),
Ukrainian football star [Andriy
Shevchenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Shevchenko) announced that he
was retiring from sports and [going into
politics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19099565).

Many of Shevchenko's Ukrainian fans were disappointed, to say the least. Not
so much because of his decision to become a politician: after all, it is
common for celebrities to endorse various political forces and to get involved
in politics in other ways, for reasons that very few people in Ukraine regard
as altruistic anymore. In Shevchenko's case, the problem was more with the
party he chose to represent in the upcoming election.

He did not announce right away which political force he was joining, however,
and his fans, potential voters and even some Ukrainian politicians spent the
next 24 hours or so making guesses.

On Facebook, [a
poll](https://www.facebook.com/questions/3613272136498/?ref=notif&notif_t=question_answer)
[ru] was set up to determine the netizens’ expectations regarding Shevchenko's
political preferences. Not many took part in this vote, but the predictions of
those who did reflected well enough the general confusion that the football
star's surprise announcement had caused. The majority of the respondents (250
votes) thought that the ruling [Party of
Regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Regions_Ukraine) was the
likeliest choice for this otherwise highly esteemed athlete; heavyweight
boxing champion [Vitaly
Klitschko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaliy_Klychko)‘s [Udar
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDAR_of_Vitaliy_Klychko) (“Strike”) came
in second, with 177 votes; 40 people saw Shevchenko as part of [Natalia
Korolevska](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korolevska)‘s [Ukrayina – Vpered!
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Natalia_Korolevska_%22Ukraine_–_Forward!%22)
(“Ukraine – Forward!”), which had been expelled from [Yulia Tymoshenko's
Bloc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko_Bloc) (BYuT) in March
2012; and just 17 respondents expected Shevchenko to join the United
Opposition, which currently includes members of
[Tymoshenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko)‘s [Batkivshchyna
Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batkivschyna) (“Fatherland”), as well as a
number of politicians from other political forces (e.g., [Arseniy
Yatseniuk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arseniy_Yatsenyuk), [Anatoliy
Hrytsenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoliy_Hrytsenko) and [Viacheslav
Kyrylenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Kyrylenko)).

On Twitter, MP Andriy Shevchenko (‏@ashevch; BYuT)
[cheered](https://twitter.com/ashevch/status/228936522244714496) [uk] his
famous namesake's announcement:

> The more Shevchenkos there are in politics, the better :) […]

Then he made [his
prediction](https://twitter.com/ashevch/status/228938163995959296) [uk] – and
followed it up with a cautious reminder of the football star's past political
involvement:

> Shevchenko ([football]) will join [Vitaly] Klitschko. The most important
> thing is for him not to campaign for [President [Viktor
> Yanukovych](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych)], the way he did
> in 2004 :) I really like my namesake and wish him to find himself.

Shevchenko the MP proved wrong about Shevchenko the football star's choice,
and so did many others. Natalia Korolevska's “Ukraine – Forward!” [turned out
to be the winner](http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/07/29/ukrainian-
soccer-star-shevchenko-turns-to-politics/).

Like Shevchenko the football star, Korolevska [favored
Yanukovych](http://www.rudenko.kiev.ua/persons/korolevskaya) [ru] over [Viktor
Yushchenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yushchenko) during the
contested [2004 presidential
election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_presidential_election,_2004),
which resulted in mass protests all over Ukraine, known as [the Orange
Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution). But while
Shevchenko was appointed Yushchenko's advisor in 2005, Korolevska became an MP
on BYuT's ticket, first [in
2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2006),
and then again [in
2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2007).
This alliance collapsed in March 2012, when Korolevska got expelled from BYuT.

(On a different note, Korolevska's brother, [Konstantin
Korolevsky](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Королевский,_Константин_Юрьевич)
[ru], used to be the First Deputy Head of the Department of Urban Construction
Policy, Development and Reconstruction of the city of Moscow, Russia; after
the 2010 resignation of his boss, Moscow Mayor [Yuri
Luzhkov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Luzhkov), Korolevsky became the
Deputy Minister for Regional Development in [Vladimir
Putin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin)‘s government.)

In her current political reincarnation, Korolevska is viewed by many not as an
independent actor, but as part of the ruling regime's pricey political
“project” – a kind of a trap set up to draw a significant number of voters
away from the opposition.

Thus, it is not surprising that many of Shevchenko's domestic fans reacted
with bitterness to his decision to run as No.2 on Korolevska's party list.

On the [FC Dynamo Kyiv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Dynamo_Kyiv)‘s fan
portal, [a news item](http://dynamo.kiev.ua/news/108914.html) [ru] announcing
Shevchenko's alliance with Korolevska generated over 800 comments. Below is
one of them, by user DK300:

On Korolevska's official Facebook Page (19,120 ‘likes’), the “acquisition” of
Shevchenko was announced through [a photo
