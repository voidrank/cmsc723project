The project of constructing a Western European identity without much space for
immigrants brought a mix of laws, verbal affirmations of hate, and even blood-
ridden attacks this summer of 2011. In spring, restrictions were placed on
inter-European border flexibility within the [Schengen
zone](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2011/05/110512_implicaciones_america_latina_revision_tratado_schengen_jrg.shtml)
[es], including [Denmark](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/16/denmark-
controversial-law-re-introduces-border-control/), and between [France and
Italy](http://indianadequesada.wordpress.com/2011/04/18/conflicto-entre-
francia-e-italia-por-los-inmigrantes-africanos-18-04-11/) [es]. In July,
Norway suffered a[ double attack from a mass
murderer](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/24/norway-the-online-traces-
of-a-mass-murderer/) who strove for a renewed crusade and promulgated hatred
towards Muslims and women.

This act motivated Abuy Nfubea, president of the Pan-African Federation of
Black Communities in Spain, to establish a parallel between fearing the other,
as much in Norway as in Spain, in an [opinion
piece](http://www.diariocritico.com/2011/Julio/opinion/nbufea/282510/nbufea.html)
[es] entitled “Is there really someone that is surprised by Norway's racist
crimes?” [es]:

> Insisto decir que nos extraña lo de Oslo es muy ofensivo, porque los que
> vamos en metro, nos paran para pedirnos papeles con perfilamiento racial o
> vivimos en Salt, Vic, Alcalá de Henares o Badalona….sabemos que no es
> extraño, que se veía venir y eso es lo peor DE ESTE CRIMEN ABOMINABLE.

I insist that saying that we are perplexed by what happened in Oslo is very
offensive because those of us who ride the metro are stopped and asked for
documentation for racial profiling, or those of us who live in Salt, Vic,
Alcalá de Henares or Badalona… know that it is not perplexing, that we saw it
coming, and that it is the worst thing about THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME.

In terms of opinions on the number of immigrants in Spain (according to
official numbers amounting to 5,0526,256 in March 2011),
[NeoBandam](http://www.barcelona.nedobandam.com/publicaciones/Cuatro-de-cada-
diez%20espanoles-estan-a-favor-de-expulsar-a-los-inmigrantes-
desempleados.html) recounts that [es]:

> el 46 por ciento opina que es “excesivo”, el 33 por ciento, que es
> “elevado”, y el 17 por ciento que es “aceptable”.

46% feel that this is “excessive,” 33% feel it is “elevated,” and 17% feel it
is “acceptable.”

In 2010 already, the [Movement Against
Intolerance](http://www.movimientocontralaintolerancia.com/) [es], with
headquarters in Madrid, warned against the links between the country's
economic crisis and the increase in xenophobia. As
[GuinGuinBali](http://www.guinguinbali.com/index.php?lang=es&mod=news&task=view_news&cat=2&id=571)
reports [es]:

> Con la irrupción de la crisis económica es un hecho el aumento del prejuicio
> xenófobo y el hostigamiento a la inmigración. (…) Además, se añade la
> agitación y hostigamiento xenófobo que impulsan grupos organizados
> extremistas que alimentan la intolerancia hacia la inmigración con consignas
> populistas del tipo “los españoles primero” y la intolerancia religiosa en
> su doble vertiente de islamofobia y antisemitismo.

With the eruption of the economic crisis, the increase in xenophobic prejudice
and harassment towards immigration is a reality. (…) Add to this, the
agitation and xenophobic harassment propelled by extremist organized groups
that feed the intolerance towards immigration with populist slogans of all
types, including “Spaniards first,” and religious intolerance, coupling
Islamophobia and Antisemitism.

**The PxC in Catalonia**

We can consider the Catalonia Platform party ([Plataforma Per Caralunya
(PxC)](http://www.pxcatalunya.com/webnormal/) [cat]), led by Josep Anglada, an
example of a group that feeds this intolerance. Recently, PxC organized a
[demonstration against
immigration](http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/08/05/actualidad/1312499435_888440.html)
in Sant Adrià de Besòs, the urban area of Barcelona, where the city council
has a state member. The news in August regarding PxC had more than enough to
report on, as their intent to protest benefits for immigrants, especially
Muslims, in Catalonia. A [state member in Salt was
dismissed](http://www.elplural.com/politica/el-xenofobo-anglada-echa-de-su-
partido-a-una-concejal-por-tener-un-novio-subsahariano/) due to her
sentimental relationships with a citizen from Cameroon, and there was an
inquiry of his legal status in the country.

Following the events in Norway and PxC's growing protagonism in Spain, the
blog Unite Against Fascism and Racism
([![](https://es.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-
content/uploads/2011/08/breivik_anglada_gran-213x300.gif)](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/29/bangladesh-
sacking-of-army-officers/82635-revision-2/)[Unitat contra el feixisme i el
racisme](http://unitatcontraelfeixisme.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/breivik-
anglada/) [cat]) exposes the ideological similarities between Norway's
murderer Anders Behring Breivik and Josep Anglada, which is based on the
belief that European principles are threatened by Muslims and the effects of
immigration.

The conflation of immigration and Islam is evident, clearly, in point 5 of the
[PxC Programmatic Declaration](http://www.pxcatalunya.com/web/declaracion.htm)
[es]. According to this document, globalization is associated with “massive
waves of illegal immigration,” which in turn, endanger the social well being
and identity formation of the welcoming States. Point 5.2 is key to
understanding the message on the association of immigration with Islam [es]:

> PxC no se opone a la inmigración, pero sí a la instalación de inmigrantes
> musulmanes en nuestro país, fenómeno que puede suponer a largo plazo una
> clara amenaza para nuestra cultura.

PxC does not oppose immigration, but rather the installation of Muslim
immigrants in our country, a phenomenon that can pose a large period of clear
threats to our culture.

Josep Anglada's words on immigration in Spain are used as an example in blogs
that criticize and denounce that the contributions of immigrants to the
Spanish sociopolitical dimension have been obscured and invisibilized. In the
blog Noticias que Dejan Huella, the post “[Immigration, the state of well
being and xenophobia in
Spain](http://ultimasnoticiaspress.blogspot.com/2011/08/inmigracion-estado-de-
bienestar-y.html) [es],” from August 10, 2011, recalls the contribution of
immigration to the state of well being that Spain experienced before the
current financial crisis, and criticizes the PxC's “complaints” [es]:

> “Niños moros” que acaparan ayudas sanitarias y eligen colegio “mientras a
> nosotros nos asignan plazas lejos de casa”. “Medicamentos gratis” para
> inmigrantes. Comerciantes paquistaníes que “no pagan impuestos ni se les
> obliga a cumplir las normas”. Una nueva mezquita inexistente. Extranjeros
> contratados “antes que los autóctonos del pueblo”.

“Moorish children” that hoard medical care and choose school “while we are
assigned posts far from home.” “Medicines free” for immigrants. Pakistani
businessmen that “do not pay taxes nor are obliged to follow the norms.” A new
non-existent mosque. Foreigners hired “before town natives.”

The recently legalized block to the passage of Romanian immigrants — that is,
gypsies — sanctioned by the rest of the European Union members, brings up a
question in online journal Latino Migrant: With one door closed to Romanian
immigrants, [will another door open for
xenophobia?](http://www.migrantelatino.com/2011/08/02/en-espana-se-cierra-una-
puerta-a-los-rumanos-%C2%BFse-abre-otra-a-la-xenofobia/) And PxC leader serves
as an example once again [es]:

> En otras ocasiones, Anglada ha pedido a las autoridades que vacunen a los
> rumanos gitanos para evitar la diseminación de enfermedades y ha calificado
> a los miembros de esta etnia como “delincuentes indeseables”.

On other occasions, Anglada has asked authorities to vaccinate Romanian
gypsies to avoid the spread of diseases and has characterized the members of
this ethnic group as “undesirable delinquents.”

The fight against the fear of Islamization in Spain is the motive behind the
blog Eurabia. Here, Josep Anglada's expressions are used once again to
highlight and denounce the discourse on the alleged dangers that Muslim
immigrants represent. “If Muslims prefer to observe Ramadan and not work, they
should leave because we do not want them here”: the title of one of the
[blog's posts on August 2,
2011](http://alianzacivilizaciones.blogspot.com/2011/08/si-los-musulmanes-
prefieren-hacer-el.html).

In this context, it is interesting to consider what the blog [Immigrants in
Spain](http://madrepatria.blogspot.com/2011/07/operacion-borrado-quien-da-
cuenta-del.html) calls an “erasure operation” of the “complaints and penalty
processes of racist crimes in Spanish territory,” which is evident in the
absence of public debates regarding the topic [es]:

> La falta de notoriedad pública no es un mero descuido o una omisión
> inocente: es una forma de borrar una problemática de la agenda pública, esto
> es, un modo de minimizar estos problemas graves y recurrentes tanto en el
> contexto nacional como mundial.

The lack of public presence is not a mere oversight or innocent omission: it
is a form of erasing a problem from the public agenda; this is a way of
minimizing these grave and recurring problems in the national, as well as
international, context.
