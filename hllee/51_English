India represents the [largest democracy in the
world](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/india-worlds-largest-
democracy/10104.html). The country has an [asymmetric federal
government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_India), with elected
officials at the federal, state and local levels. The head of government, the
prime minister, is elected by the members of [Lok
Sabha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha), the lower house of parliament.
Lok Sabha members are elected every five years, and this year's Lok Sabha
elections, otherwise known as the Indian general elections 2014, kicks off
today, April 7, 2014.

The [world's biggest elections](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/india-kick-off-
worlds-biggest-election-remote-northeast-190508362.html) are scheduled to run
until 12 May 2014 in nine phases, during which voting will take place at about
930,000 polling stations throughout all the [543 parliamentary constituencies
of India](http://loksabha-2014.com/lok-sabha-election-2014-live/1/). The
results will be declared on 16 May 2014.

There are about 814.5 million voters, the most in the world, and nearly 100
million newly eligible voters have been added since the previous elections.
The participating political parties are expected to spend [about 5 billion US
dollars on
campaigns](http://www.ndtv.com/elections/article/election-2014/india-s-spend-
on-elections-could-challenge-us-record-report-493685), the second highest in
the world after the US elections. [More than 10 million
officials](http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2014/04/03/facts-and-figures-for-
the-2014-general-election/) including security forces will be deployed and 1.4
million electronic voting machines will be used for the election. But there
are [still challenges for people with
disabilities](http://globalaccessibilitynews.com/2014/04/03/india-still-years-
away-from-an-accessible-election-for-people-with-disabilities/) to participate
in the elections due to lack of accessibility infrastructure.

**The actors**

The [main contest](http://loksabha-2014.com/lok-sabha-election-2014-live/1/)
is between the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), United Progressive Alliance
(UPA) and the Third Front. However, the main rivalry in this election will be
between [Narendra Modi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi), candidate
for prime minister from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic
Alliance, and [Rahul Gandhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi), the
vice president of the Indian National Congress party and the chairperson of
the Indian Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Hindu nationalist Modi, and its
allies [are forecast](http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/04/04/india-
elections-opinion-polls-show-modi-out-in-the-lead) to win in majority of the
constituencies, leaving behind the incumbent Congress party and its allies.

The elections are not without controversy. Modi is accused of failing to stop
or even encouraging anti-Muslim riots in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, where
he was chief minister. At least 1,000 people died in the violence, most of
them Muslims. Modi denies the charges.

Almost [one-fifth of candidates in India's upcoming general
elections](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/02/fifth-india-election-
candidate-face-criminal-charges?CMP=twt_gu) face criminal charges including
rape, murder and extortion. Religious violence [has been
predicted](http://www.navegalo.com/indias-gandhi-warns-of-religious-trouble-
on-election-eve-5/) during the elections.

Here are netizens’ take on the elections:

**Elections on social media:**

This year, more and more social media tools are being used for campaigning in
India. The [Washington Post
reported](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/indian-parties-are-using-obama-
style-campaign-tactics-in-crucial-
election/2014/04/06/db7d4571-8333-4334-b252-3ebd99b25746_story.html) that
Indian parties are using Obama-style campaign tactics to spread the words and
woo voters. Candidates are using every gadget and platform – taking part in
Google+ Hangouts, televised interviews organised on Facebook and using smart
phone messaging app WhatsApp – to connect with millions of tech-savvy urban
voters.

In India, [Facebook has 93 million users](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-
india-26762391) and Twitter has approximately 33 million accounts nationwide.
Facebook and Twitter users will “[wield a tremendous
influence](http://socialmediatoday.com/alexsmithsmf/2321696/politics-and-
social-media-combine-indian-elections)” over the final results of the
election, reported the Mumbai-based Iris Knowledge Foundation.

Narendra Modi has 3.68 million followers on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/narendramodi) and has attracted more than a
million volunteers to his campaign. Rahul Gandhi [is not tweeting
personally](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/nqomLTqXB48umPkOonKIuM/Will-
Rahul-Gandhi-join-Twitter-soon.html) (although he has a fan-run account).
Gandhi's Facebook page has more than [190,000
followers](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rahul-Gandhi/27605962090), while
Modi has more than [12 million
follower](https://www.facebook.com/narendramodi)s. Anti-corruption campaigner
and former Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal has more than 1.5 million
followers on Twitter.

Google India has [introduced a Google Elections
hub](http://googleindia.blogspot.in/2014/03/googles-election-hub-empowers-
voters.html) in an attempt to encourage first-time voters and the growing
number of Internet users in the country.

Google and Storyful [have
partnered](http://blog.storyful.com/2014/04/02/google-and-storyfuls-open-
elections-india-community/) to build an [Open Elections India Google+
community](https://plus.google.com/communities/116616396642157763127), a
destination for citizen reporters and people monitoring the election to
discover, verify, discuss and amplify content emerging from the social web
during the general elections.

The women of India make up 49 percent of the electoral base, but [women go to
vote far less than their male
counterparts](http://indiblogeshwaris.com/2014/03/2014-india-election-the-
power-of-womaniya-vote-and-make-her-vote/). [Jaago
Re](http://www.jaagore.com/) has initiated a social campaign called the Power
of 49 to encourage more female voters to participate in the election.

Social Samosa launched the [MTS Election
Tracker](http://www.socialsamosa.com/electiontracker/), a live dashboard that
showcases analysis of conversations around the web and social media about
political parties in graphic form. The tracker provides real-time data
analysis of data from throughout the web and from Facebook, Twitter and
YouTube as well as tracks mentions of leading [political parties and
politicians](http://www.socialsamosa.com/2014/04/electiontracker2014-politicians-
social-media/).
