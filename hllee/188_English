Thousands of protesters took to Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the Egyptian
revolution in downtown Cairo, today in protest against Egypt's military
rulers. Soon, crowds of young men swarmed to the Israeli Embassy, where they
tore down a security wall built to protect the Embassy, and brought down the
Israeli flag, as chaos continued into the night. Here's a snippet of how the
events played out on Twitter.

This is the second time in a month that protestors scale the 15-storey Embassy
building to remove the Israeli flag. Reports say that four protesters climbed
the building today.

Five hours ago _Al Jazeera_ ‘s correspondent Sherine Tadros reported:

A few minutes later, Tadros tweeted:

العلم يولع بالطريقه دى..

[@Raafatology](https://twitter.com/#!/Raafatology/status/112247650216198144):
The Israeli Embassy should hoist a cucumber next time, so that its flag is not
burnt this way everyday.

Others on Twitter as not as ecstatic.
