Monday, June 2, 2014, will go down in Spain's history as the day that King
Juan Carlos I abdicated his throne. According to his own words, “A new
generations is claiming the leading role (…). Today, a younger generation
deserves to move to the frontline.” Within hours, hundreds of thousands of
citizens hit the streets throughout the country calling for a referendum that
would allow them to decide whether to keep the monarchy or to replace it with
a republic in which they could elect a head of state.

Many observers see the crown's attempt to maintain the monarchical system in
this abdication, and consider the fact that it is taking place while a
conservative party governs Spain with an absolute majority to be a move to
ensure that the succession is carried out smoothly.

But the feeling on the street seems to be quite different. Following the
abdication, social networks witnessed an avalanche of comments that broke all
records. Together with hashtags like

and [#VivaElRey](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VivaElRey&src=typd)

On Change.org, two petitions were created to ask for a referendum on the
monarchy which reached more than
[23,000](http://www.change.org/es/peticiones/gobierno-de-
espa%C3%B1a-refer%C3%A9ndum-ciudadano-sobre-la-continuidad-de-la-
monarqu%C3%ADa) [es] and [15,000](http://www.change.org/es/peticiones/mariano-
rajoy-brey-referend%C3%BAm-rep%C3%BAblica-o-monarqu%C3%ADa) [es] signatures,
respectively, after one day of being opened. Another [petition on
Avaaz.org](https://secure.avaaz.org/es/petition/Todos_los_Partidos_Politicos_de_Espana_Referendum_YA/?prns)
[es] exceeded 265,000 signatures at the time of writing this article.

The decline in the king's popularity has been increasingly evident in recent
years, as shown by the chart that accompanies this [tweet from Europa
press](https://twitter.com/europapress_es/status/473447763410436096) [es]:

Undoubtedly, the scandals that have hit the royal family head on in recent
years have contributed to this drastic loss of support from the people: [the
trial of the king's son-in-
law](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/02/12/spain-bail-of-81-million-euro-
for-the-kings-son-in-law/), Iñaki Urdangarín, [the charges against Princess
Cristina](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/01/13/spains-princess-cristina-
charged-with-money-laundering-and-tax-evasion/) in the same case, the
[luxurious hunting trips in times of
crisis](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/04/19/spain-the-king-and-the-
elephants/), the appearance of the king's alleged mistress, Corinna zu Sayn-
Wittgenstein, who used an extravagantly decorated [house belonging to the
National Heritage](http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2013/04/08/la-casa-
del-rey-se-gasto-casi-500000-euros-en-decorar-el-chale-de-corinna-en-el-
pardo-118259) [es]… Although the Spanish monarchy happens to be one of the
least expensive in the world, in recent months there have been rumors about
the king's personal fortune, which
[NBC](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/spain-asks-what-next-after-abdication-
king-juan-carlos-n120346) calculates to be more than 2 billion euros:

> Thirty-nine years after he took the throne, the outgoing king is now seen as
> a man deeply out-of-touch with the social landscape of post-economic-
> meltdown Spain.
>
> Some estimate the king's worth could exceed 2 billion euro, a galling sum

> financial crisis.

Some estimate that the king's assets could surpass 2 billion euros, an
offensive figure for a country that has been one of those hit hardest by the
financial crisis in Europe.

The king's friendship with big entrepreneurs and bankers – some jailed for
corruption –, [quite favored by the king's official
travels](http://www.eldiario.es/economia/capitalismo-amiguetes-corte-Juan-
Carlos_0_266674329.html) [es] around the world in search of business
opportunities for the elite, has also been criticized. A few months ago, the
role of the crown in the transition was also questioned following the
publication of a book entitled “The great forgetfulness” by Pilar Urbano, in
which the journalist claimed that the attempted military coup on February 23,
1981 was [organized by the king
himself](http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Pilar-Urbano-extremis-puesto-
marcha_0_244626194.html) [es] to win the loyalty of the Spanish people.

Spanish citizens also disagree with the opacity surrounding the monarchical
institution, [not required to detail accounts under the new transparency
law](http://vozpopuli.com/actualidad/32720-transparencia-en-la-corona-la-casa-
real-no-esta-obligada-a-detallar-sus-cuentas) [es]. The constitution states
that “The King's person is inviolable and not subject to liability,” meaning
he cannot be held accountable for any of his actions, which becomes difficult
to understand in a democracy, as is the new Judiciary Law that grants the
condition of immunity to the queen and the until the moment princes of
Asturias.

For many Spaniards, the fact that the Constitution has not been amended since
its adoption in 1978 is a testament to the stagnation of the Spanish political
class – including the monarchy – and its remoteness from the citizens. [Andrés
Gil](http://www.eldiario.es/politica/abdicacion-Juan-Carlos-puntilla-
Transicion_0_266674113.html) [es] expresses it as such on eldiario.es:

> La Constitución de 1978 responde a 1978. Pero 2014 ya no es 1978. (…) Una
> ciudadanía que se organiza, debate y hace política, principalmente sin
> partidos, y que este lunes ha salido a la calle en toda España para pedir un
> referéndum sobre el modelo de Estado mientras los políticos dominantes se

The demonstrations calling for a referendum on the state model have not ended
just yet: new protests will be held this
[weekend](https://www.facebook.com/events/1434002510194498/?ref=70) [es].
