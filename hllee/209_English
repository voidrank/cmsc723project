While uprisings across Middle East and North African countries are turning
into revolutions, many ponder over the question “who is next”? What countries
or even regions might next be hit by the rebellion wave, if any.

Last month, Alen Mattich at _The Wall Street Journal_ produced and
[published](http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2011/02/25/introducing-the-revolting-
index/?KEYWORDS=Uzbekistan  "published ") an index of likely candidates ripe
for an upheaval. The ranking is based on three equally-weighed criteria:
social disparity; propensity to revolt; and the share that food makes up in a
household's total expenditures.

According to Mattich, Uzbekistan is in the top 20 along with Libya, Egypt,
Algeria and Tunisia. The fact that Uzbekistan (with index 76.4) is 15th on the
list, while Libya (with 76.9) holds the 13th place, has provoked numerous
articles in the local online media and in the blogosphere.

Uzbekistan and Uzbek citizens access it using through services):

However, recent steps taken by the Uzbek government have been aimed at
strengthening control over the citizens. They show that the authorities feel
the danger of possible unrest in Uzbekistan.

_Uznews.com_[reports](http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=ru&sub=top&cid=30&nid=16670
"reports") [ru], that the Uzbek Agency for Communication and Information
(UzACI) obliged the mobile operators and Internet Service Providers (ISP) to
disconnect users at the first request from the authorities. From now on,
mobile operators and ISPs have to report on any mass SMS distribution that has
“shady content” and also to disconnect users from the web, if state bodies
tell them to do so.

The UzACI have so far refused to confirm or disavow this information. The
biggest ISPs in Uzbekistan – Sharq Telecom, Sarkor Telecom and TPS – said they
have not received such instructions.

Blogger _Grazy-gunner_ sees these measures as a tool of the government to
secure itself against the possible urpisings, but he does not believe that
revolution can happen in Uzbekistan. He [writes](http://grazy-
gunner.livejournal.com/652576.html "writes") [ru]:

> Central Asian people lived in the USSR [Soviet Union] for many years and

Referring to this news, Abdilfazal cites Vladimir Zharikhin, Deputy Director
of the CIS Institute [saying](http://www.neweurasia.net/cross-regional-and-
blogosphere/anti-revolution-agenda-seize-the-control-over-cellular-companies/
"saying"):

Although there is no Islamic fundamentalism and the role of mass media is not
big, one can see many similarities of the political developments in Uzbekistan
and in the MENA countries. Dictatorial regimes, corrupted economies, cronyism
and absence of freedom of expression are few, but not the only examples.

However, Uzbek citizens are afraid of being shot in case they dare to ask for
more freedom. As results of the online survey
[show](http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=ru&sub=top&cid=31&nid=16467
"show") [ru], nearly 85 per cent of the population is sure that the president
would order to shoot people in case they go onto the streets. This assurance
can be explained by the 2005 [Andijan
massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andijan_massacre "Andijan massacre"),
when the president Karimov ordered to shoot at the protesters – including
women and children – who had been holding a peaceful rally.

User _“a”_ [thinks
](http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=ru&sub=top&cid=31&nid=16467
"thinks ")[ru] that even if revolution happens in Uzbekistan, it would hardly
change the people’s life much:

> Today the revolution should be arranged in everyone’s life – it’s about
> education, professional and personal development. Only then one can
> influence any long-term processes. And social upheavals that involve
> uneducated masses cannot solve problems. No crutches can help if a person
