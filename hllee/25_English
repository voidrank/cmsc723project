Nepal's [Chitwan National
Park](http://www.chitwannationalpark.gov.np/index.php/background) has beaten
out all other tiger sanctuaries in the world to be
[become](http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=91747)
the first to be accredited by the new [Conservation Assured Tiger Standards
(CA|TS)](http://www.conservationassured.org/cats_wp/about-cats-tiger-
protection/).

Located in the subtropical inner Terai lowlands of south-central Nepal, the
park earned the accreditation from the [Tigers Alive Initiative
(TAI)](https://www.facebook.com/stripesandstride/posts/675761852488164) of the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF). To qualify, tiger conservation areas must meet a
set of 17 standards. Chitwan National Park met them all, and is considered a
[well-managed, protected and effective refuge for
tigers](http://www.nepalitimes.com/blogs/thebrief/2015/02/06/chitwan-best-
tiger-habitat/).

Tigers are an endangered species, with only a few thousand left in the world,
according to the [IUCN Red List of Threatened
Species](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15955/0).

Chitwan National Park, which was established in 1973, boasts of having largest
number of tigers in Nepal, with [120 tigers out of the 198
tigers](http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/05/22/top-story/chitwan-national-park-
starts-special-research-on-tigers/389910.html ) in the country. The national
park is also home to the world’s second largest population of one-horned
rhinos, with [503 out of 534
individuals](http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?200112/Collective-conservation-
efforts-boosted-rhino-population-in-Nepal) in Nepal.

Nepal achieved [zero poaching](http://tigers.panda.org/nepal/nepal-got-
zeropoaching/) for the year 2011 for rhinos and for 12 months ending February
2014 for rhinos, tigers and elephants. With tiger numbers [growing by 63 per
cent](http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2015/02/06/nation/cnp-
lauded-for-tiger-conservation-effort/272936.html ) as per the 2013 census, the
Chitwan National Park became the most successful park in conserving tigers.

The rise in the number of tigers is a good boost to the government’s target of
[doubling the tiger population by
2022](http://www.wwfnepal.org/?188861/Tx2-campaign-launched-in-Nepal ).

Not a single tiger was killed in Nepal in the last three years. However, the
illegal wildlife trade has not stopped. News of [poachers and traders being
arrested](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Two-from-UP-held-in-
Nepal-with-tiger-skin-bones/articleshow/45972469.cms ) with tiger skins and
bones have not stopped in spite of the authorities claiming zero poaching.

When a rhino is poached, the poachers hack off the horn and sometimes the
hooves, but leave behind the body. However, the case of a tiger is different.
Each and every part of the carcass is traded. The poachers don’t leave even a
single trace of the hunt – be it skin, toes, nail, bones or meat – and
everything is sold at high prices.

While the whole nation and the conservationists are overjoyed with the feat
achieved by Nepal, the concerned authorities should leave no room for
complacency. In May 2014, the Chitwan National Park officials and Nepal army
personnel [found a dead de-horned
rhino](http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/05/04/national/rhino-killed-in-chitwan-
sanctuary/389114.html ) only few weeks after the Nepal celebrated the second
consecutive Zero Poaching Year.

Even though Nepal police was successful in bringing the most notorious rhino
poacher, [Raj Kumar
Praja](http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=91840
), suspected of killing over 30 rhinos, from Malaysia, petty [smugglers and
traders](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-indian-origin-man-arrested-in-
nepal-with-tiger-bones-and-pistols-2054234 ) are still carrying on with the
lucrative illegal trade.

The bright side is that Nepal's zero poaching has inspired the tiger range
countries Bhutan, Russia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, India and Vietnam attending the
[Symposium on Towards Zero Poaching in Asia](https://www.thedodo.com/nepal-
poaching-asia-summit-972995657.html?xrs=MARevealed_googleplus   ) to join the
effort to save the magnificent creature from poaching.

[TRAFFIC](http://www.traffic.org/overview/), the wildlife trade monitoring
network, tweeted:

> [#NEPAL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NEPAL?src=hash) Zero Poaching Symposium
> ends with accord on 5 key ways to tackle poaching <http://t.co/hu8eSQ55Sv>
> [pic.twitter.com/7l7ZBZVz8R](http://t.co/7l7ZBZVz8R)
>
> — TRAFFIC (@TRAFFIC_WLTrade) [February 6,
> 2015](https://twitter.com/TRAFFIC_WLTrade/status/563693935558930432)

The [five recommendations](http://www.traffic.org/home/2015/2/6/asia-unites-
against-poaching.html) from the symposium, if implemented well, will lead to
zero poaching in Asia.

While the world has a lot to learn from [how Nepal got zero
poaching](http://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/how-nepal-got-to-zero-poaching?
), the CA|TS accreditation for Chitwan National Park is an inspiration to all
– to save the royal Bengal tigers and all other tiger species from extinction.
