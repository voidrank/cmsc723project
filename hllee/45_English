Rwanda remains deeply scarred by the 1994 genocide of 800,000 to 1 million
people, including [80 percent of the Tutsi
population](http://www.cnlg.gov.rw/genocide-28.html) as well as many Hutus.
Around one-sixth of the country's total population was killed in a matter of
weeks.

Twenty years later the process of reconciliation still has a long way to go.
President Paul Kagame is accused of suppressing his opponents, among other
serious human rights violations. But efforts to rebuild are beginning to yield
results.

**The Good News**

One of Rwanda's most remarkable achievements is the progress of gender
equality in numerous areas. The percentage of women in the Rwandan parliament,
at almost 64 percent, is the highest in the world, according to the Inter-
Parliamentary Union's[ 2014 ranking](http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm) of
189 countries.

Louis Michel, a former minister in Belgium and European commissioner, noted on
his [personal blog](http://www.louismichel.be/2013/09/26/objectifs-du-
millenaire-pour-le-developpement-lexemple-rwandais-carte-blanche-le-soir-et-

The country's first five-year plan for the development of [new
technologies](http://www.un.org/africarenewal/fr/magazine/avril-2014/rwanda-
objectif-2020) [fr], created in 2001, showed significant progress. During the
plan's second phase, which ended in 2010, Rwanda saw a 8,900 percent increase
in users, compared with 2,450 percent for the rest of the continent and a
world average of 44 percent. The magazine African Renewal, hosted by the U.N.,
[reports ](http://www.un.org/africarenewal/fr/magazine/avril-2014/rwanda-
objectif-2020)that four divisions of the public sector (ministers, agencies,
provinces, and districts) and almost a third of the private sector have an
online presence. Rwanda's capital Kigali plays a primary role in the
development of the surveillance system of navigation and aerial communications
throughout the region.

President Kagame [maintains
](http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/april-2014/big-dreams-
rwanda%E2%80%99s-ict-sector)that “the Internet is a needed public utility as
much as water and electricity.” In collaboration with the Rwandan Telecentre
Network (RTN), the government has implemented a plan for the development of
Internet access in rural zones. A [report ](http://www.balancingact-
africa.com/news/fr/edition-fran-aise-2/159/actualit-s-informati/rwanda-un-r-
seau-de/fr)[fr] published on balancingact-africa.com states:

> Rwandan Telecentre Network (RTN) s’est rallié aux efforts du gouvernement et
> s’est engagé à créer un réseau national de 1 000 centres TIC d’ici la fin de
> 2015 et à former du personnel local.

> Rwandan Telecentre Network (RTN) is rallying with the government's efforts,
> pledging to create a national network of 1,000 ITC centers by the end of
> 2015 and to train local personnel.

A further sign of advancing access to new technologies is that Rwanda is the
highest achiever among the African countries participating in the program[ One
Laptop Per Child](http://one.laptop.org/). According to the[ OLPC wiki
page](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Rwanda) :

> By the end of 2012, 210,000 laptops have been deployed to more than 217
> schools across the country. In 2013: 210k = 110K (before 2012) +100k (2012)
> laptops [were distributed] in country

**The Hopeful News**

After the genocide, the country took legal action, creating a [National Unity
and Reconciliation Commission](http://www.nurc.gov.rw/index.php?id=83) (NURC).
The NURC, established in 1999, aims to contribute to good government; promote
unity, reconciliation and social cohesion between Rwandans; and form a country
where everyone has the same rights.

Susan Thomson, a professor of contemporary African politics at Hampshire
College in the U.S., wrote in an [article](http://www.cairn.info/revue-
geneses-2010-4-page-45.htm#) [fr] published on academic publication hub
Cairn.info:

The [Rwanda Peace
Academy](http://www.rw.undp.org/content/rwanda/en/home/operations/projects/democratic_governance/support-
to-the-establishment-of-the-rwanda-peace-academy--rpa-.html) (RPA) is an
example of those advances. Created in 2009 with the financial backing of Japan
and the United Nations Development Program, the RPA has a mission is to carry
out research and to develop and implement professional training courses and
internationally recognized educational programs. Its goal is to provide the
army, police and civil servants with the necessary skills to respond to
current challenges and future peace and security issues in Africa.

**The Bad News**

Unfortunately, this promising work is marred by the grave human rights
violations reported by advocacy groups. Violations have been occurring for
years. In 2012, after having sent several missions to the country, Amnesty
International [condemned ](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/rwanda-must-
investigate-unlawful-detention-and-torture-military-
intelligence-2012-10-05)the violations:

> Between March 2010 and June 2012, Amnesty International documented 45 cases
> of unlawful detention and 18 allegations of torture or ill-treatment at Camp
> Kami, Mukamira military camp, and in safe houses in the capital, Kigali. The
> men were detained by J2 for periods ranging from 10 days to nine months
> without access to lawyers, doctors and family members.

[Assassinations of opposition members](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/blaise-
ndala/rwanda-kagame-assassine-opposants_b_4655885.html) [fr] have also been
reported outside the country. Journalists and former political leaders close
to the Rwandan president have been [arrested or
killed](http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140103-rwanda-afrique-du-sud-assassinat-
karegeya-nombreux-precedents/) [fr]. The most recent arrests were confirmed at
the beginning of April 2014.

Singer and activist Kizito Mihigo – Public Domain

The site [arretsurimages.net](arretsurimages.net) [fr] reported the arrest of
famous singer Kizito Mihigo, a genocide survivor, and three other individuals,
including a journalist accused of plotting a grenade attack on a building in
Kigali. Kizito Mihigo, however, is known for his activism for peace. He even
founded an NGO for peace education. His
[blog](http://www.kizitomihigo.com/index.php/fr/) [fr] reads:

> Depuis l'année 2003, il a œuvré pour le pardon, la réconciliation et l'unité
> dans la diaspora rwandaise en Europe. En 2010 quand il est rentré au Rwanda,
> il a Fondé la Fondation KMP (Kizito Mihigo pour la Paix), une ONG rwandaise
> qui utilise l'art (musique, theatre poesie, ..) dans l'éducation à la Paix,
> à la Réconciliation et à la Non-violence après le génocide.

> founded the KMP Foundation (Kizito Mihigo for Peace), a Rwandan NGO that
> uses art (music, theater, poetry…) in education focused on peace,
> reconciliation and non-violence after the genocide.

The singer pleaded guilty, but [serious
doubts](http://www.slateafrique.com/464759/rwanda-etrange-affaire-kizito-
risque-destabiliser-rwanda) [fr] were raised about many aspects of the case.

Furthermore, for the past several years Kigali has had[ tense diplomatic
relations](http://www.causeur.fr/paul-kagame-rwanda-genocide,27024) [fr] with
several other countries. Once a country favored by the West, Rwanda is now
becoming a no-go area and is[ losing its
military](http://www.slateafrique.com/92751/rwanda-paul-kagame-lache-par-l-
occident) [fr] and development aid. Diplomatic relations with South Africa are
strained following assassinations of opposition members in that country. There
have already been [expulsions of
diplomats](http://emiradamo.com/2014/03/07/expulsions-croisees-de-diplomates-
