arrests-iconic-blogger-Razan-Ghazzawi-and-leading-activists.html)Syrian
blogger and freedom of speech advocate Razan Ghazzawi on Thursday 16 February,
2012, during a raid on the offices of the Syrian Center for Freedom of
Expression in Damascus where the activist works. Ghazzawi was arrested along
with 13 of her colleagues, including the Head of the Center, Mazen Darwish.

This is the second time Razan Ghazzawi is arrested by the Syrian authorities.
She was [first
detained](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/05/syria-free-razan-
ghazzawi/) in December 2011 at the Syrian-Jordanian border while on her way to
attend a conference on freedom of expression online. Her arrest sparked an
online outcry and an international campaign called for her immediate release.
Razan was eventually [released
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/18/syria-will-blogger-razan-ghazzawi-
be-released-soon/)after spending 15 days in jail.

Ghazzawi is a US-born Syrian blogger who has contributed to [Global Voices
Online](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/razan-ghazzawi/) and [Global
Voices Advocacy](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/author/razan/). She
is one of the few courageous bloggers in Syria who writes under her real name,
even after her first arrest.

was one of the first outlets to break the news. It posted the following
statement:

> إننا في المركز السوري للدراسات والأبحاث القانونية ندين هذا الاعتقال ونطالب
> السلطات السورية بإطلاق سراحهم فورا ونعتبر هذه الخطوة تجاه المدافعين عن حرية
> التعبير تؤكد موقف وسعي السلطات السورية لخنق أي صوت وحتى خنق الأصوات المدافعة
> عن حرية التعبير وزيف الادعاءات بالانفتاح والحوار وتعديل الدستور والسماح
> بالحقوق الأساسية للإنسان.

We at the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research condemn this arrest and
call on Syrian authorities to release [the activists] immediately. We consider
this action against the advocates of freedom of expression confirms the
position of the Syrian authorities who want to stifle any voice advocating for
freedom of expression. It exposes the false claims [of the Syrian government]
about openness, dialogue and constitutional reform.

The news caused disbelief among netizens who were very quick to react. Nadine
Ghazzawi, Razan's sister, tweets:

> [@NadineGhazzawi](https://twitter.com/#!/NadineGhazzawi/status/170178651667705856):
> They arrested my sister Razan Ghazzawi again! She got arrested at work in
> the center of Damascus today evening

Journalist Ahmed Shihab-Eldin laments:

> [@ASE](https://twitter.com/#!/ASE/statuses/170190414949781504): Yet another
> sad day for #Syria and #FreeSpeech

BSyria remembers his last conversation with Razan:

> [@BSyria](https://twitter.com/#!/BSyria/statuses/170195164462194688): I
> chatted with Razan yesterday. I asked her: Are u being harassed? She said,
> “No, I told u I'm not that important.” #FreeRazan #syria
