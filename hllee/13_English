[![world elephant day](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

day-800x296.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/worldelephantday?fref=ts)Today,
August 12, is [World Elephant Day](https://www.facebook.com/worldelephantday).
Various groups have joined forces to spread awareness about the decreasing
number of elephants because of
[poaching](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/11/25/mozambique-elephant-
poaching/), the destruction of wild habitats, and illegal ivory trade. This is
the [fourth](http://worldelephantday.org/news/press-room) annual World
Elephant Day:

> World Elephant Day has been created to bring the world together to help
> elephants. It is a day to honor elephants, to spread awareness about the
> critical threats they are facing, and to support positive solutions that
> will help ensure their survival.

Misty Herrin, director for the Nature Conservancy, added that the
#SaveElephants campaign aims to inspire the people all over the world to
support initiatives that protect the welfare of elephants:

> So many people around the world love elephants but aren’t aware that
> elephants are in crisis. World Elephant Day helps increase security for
> elephants and expand habitat because it creates an opportunity to raise a
> rallying cry.

Consumers and tourists are also encouraged to remember some of these
[tips](http://worldelephantday.org/how-to-help-elephants) when buying products
or visiting countries that promote elephant tourism:

> Do not buy ivory or other wildlife products. Be an elephant aware consumer.
>
> Visit elephants in countries where they live in the wild – tourism benefits
> the economy, provides needed jobs, deters poachers and abuse, and gives you
> the opportunity to experience the beauty, intelligence, and emotional
> capacity of these magnificent giants.
>
> If you wish to experience elephants in their natural environment, choose
> eco-tourism operators who support local elephant conservation projects and
> who treat elephants with respect and dignity.

elephants

It is estimated that as few as 400,000 African elephants remain in the wild.
Meanwhile, about 35,000 [Asian
elephants](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/29392-be-an-ele-friend-
jointheherd) are left and are already considered endangered species.

> Elephants once roamed across most of Asia, from Iraq into India and from
> Southern China to the islands of Indonesia. However, hunting and habitat
> destruction have reduced their range to just 15% of their former habitat.
> The species now only survives in small, highly fragmented areas in 13
> countries.

In Laos, once [known](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/01/25/saving-
elephants-in-laos/) as the ‘land of a million elephants’, only 300 to 600
elephants are left.

John Calvelli, from the the Wildlife Conservation Society,
[reminds](http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/11/the-
proposed-4d-rule-on-ivory-and-how-each-of-us-can-help-ensure-a-future-for-
elephants/#.VcqmTinec7k.twitter) United States residents that they can help
stop ivory trade:

> The elephant crisis is not an ocean away; it is in our cities, at our
> doorstep, and at our fingertips online. The U.S. is one of the world’s
> largest ivory consumers and maintains a legal commercial ivory market that
> serves as cover for smuggled ivory, which is virtually impossible to
> differentiate from legal ivory without a costly scientific analysis.
>
> …if we expect the rest of the world to work with us on stopping the
> potential extinction of Africa’s elephants, Americans must realize that the
> fight to save elephants is also taking place here at home.

The World Elephant Day is an international initiative co-founded by the
Elephant Reintroduction Foundation and Patricia Sims.
