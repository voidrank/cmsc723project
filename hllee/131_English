The killing of [Aboud Rogo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboud_Rogo), a
controversial Muslim cleric, on August 27, 2012, caused [riots and unrest in
Mombasa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19394364), a coastal city and
a main tourist destination in Kenya.

These riots, which started on August 27, 2012 and continued until August 30,
2012, saw more than ten casualties. Following the killing of Rogo and the
subsequent riots, netizens took to their blogs and Twitter to discuss issues
such as extra judicial killings, human rights, religious tensions and lack of
employment opportunities fueling anger among the Kenyan youth in Mombasa.

Eberinyama, a Kenyan blogger, wondered if Rogo's alleged linkages with al-
Shabab (a militant Islamist group that has been [making
inroads](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1225930--kenya-braces-for-
attack-as-somalia-s-war-continues) into Kenya) resulted in his killing. He
[pointed out](http://ebereinyama.blogspot.in/2012/08/riots-take-over-mombasa-
kenya-after.html) that:

> Aboud Rogo Mohammed was suspected of being a key recruiter for Kenyan
> Muslims fighting in Somalia. It is not known who shot him, but he was on a
> United Nations sanctions list for allegedly financing the militant Somali
> group al-Shabab.

According to The Canuck FireBrand, Rogo's killing had all the elements of
extrajudicial killings that the Kenyan police have earned a reputation for.
The blogger
[reported](http://canuckfirebrand.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/militant-muslim-
cleric-killed-by-gunmen-sparking-deadly-riots-in-kenya/):

> The killing on Monday of Aboud Rogo fits into a pattern of extrajudicial
> killings and forced disappearances of suspected terrorists that is allegedly
> being orchestrated by Kenyan police, say Kenyan human rights groups… He is
> the fifth alleged Muslim extremist who has been killed or who disappeared in
> the last four months, according to human rights campaigners. One corpse was
> found mutilated and the other four men vanished.
>
> Hassan Omar Hassan, a former deputy head of the government-funded, Kenya
> National Commission on Human Rights, said police had used the strategy of
> eliminating suspects before.
>
> In a 2008 report, the commission said Kenyan police were to blame for the

> October 2007.

The police on their part [denied](http://www.kenyaninsight.com/aboud-rogo-was-
murdered-by-his-opponents/) any role in the killing and have hinted at the
possibility of Rogo having been assassinated either by his rivals or by the[
members of al-Shabab](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19396421), the
latter possibly having done it to gain sympathy and “galvanise support” among
the Muslim youth in Mombasa.

Some netizens on Twitter cautioned that the violence was a ploy to escalate
unrest within the country:

> [Sharon Langat](https://twitter.com/MeMyKenya/status/241102231489880064)
> (@MeMyKenya): I am almost certain that the assassination of Sheikh Aboud
> Rogo is an attempt to put Kenya on the map as chaotic again. Lets not follow
> suit

Others linked the rioting and unrest to grievances over land ownership and
growing frustration and anger among the youth in Mombasa, given the lack of
employment opportunities.

Richard Lough [warned
that](http://newchristianpost.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/riots-shake-kenyas-
mombasa-after-muslim-cleric-slain/) long-standing local grievances in Mombasa
could worsen the situation:

> The violence could worsen if it taps into long-standing local grievances
> over land ownership and unemployment, as well as calls by the Mombasa
> Republican Council (MRC) for the coastal strip to secede. The MRC said it
> was not involved in the unrest.

In this context, Tweets mentioned issues such as youth unemployment and
poverty:

Netizens also called for a stop to the religious violence being unleashed on
the Christian community as a fallout of Rogo's killing:

> [mmnjug ](https://twitter.com/mmnjug/status/242487632070848512)(@mmnjug):
> Threat of religious violence in #Mombasa must be nipped in the bud

The YouTube video below, recorded by [Kenya's Citizen
Television](http://www.youtube.com/user/kenyacitizentv?feature=watch
"kenyacitizentv"), shows religious leaders from both Christian and Muslim
sides and local politicians condemning Rogo's killing and call for calm:

This move was appreciated by netizens who tweeted their approval of this act
of [interfaith
unity](http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000065339&story_title=-Coast-
leaders,-clerics-unite-in-preaching-religious-harmony) and hoped that this
would usher in a better and peaceful coexistence of the two religious
communities in Mombasa.

In this context, the following conversation between two Kenyans on Twitter is
worth noting:

Rogo is the fifth alleged Islamic radical [killed in Kenya in
2012](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/aboud-rogo-
kenya_n_1832837.html). Apart from religious tensions between Muslims and the
government in Mombasa, a Mombasa-based separatist group called [the Mombasa
Republican Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa_Republican_Council)
is calling for cessation from Kenya claiming that the Kenyan central
government has not done enough to develop the coast.
