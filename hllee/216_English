Weeks of pro- and anti-government protests in Yemen are beginning to change
the country's political atmosphere.

Wednesday, February 23, President Ali Abdullah Saleh
[demanded](http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news236447.htm) [ar] security forces
take action against violence among demonstrators. Saleh ordered the forces to
physically separate pro- and anti-government groups to reduce the chance of
fighting.

This came after pro-government
“[thugs](http://www.canadaviews.ca/2011/02/23/yemen-urged-to-halt-escalating-
crackdown-after-two-reported-killed-in-capital/)” used knives and guns to
attack students holding a sit-in against the government at the University of
Sanaa, killing at least one person wounding up to 20 more. The violence
[prompted](http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/February/middleeast_February741.xml&section=middleeast)
seven members of Parliament to resign.

On YouTube, [belaquood](http://www.youtube.com/user/belaquood) uploaded a
video on February 23, showing police separating protesters from different
political factions. It's titled: “Thanks to the policemen for keeping away the
thugs.”

The goodwill will certainly be tested. Protests [took
place](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/feb/24/libya-gaddafi-turmoil-
obama) on Thursday, February 24 in Sanaa, Aden and Hodeidah, the country's
fourth-largest city. A bomb
[exploded](http://bikyamasr.com/wordpress/?p=28451) in the southern town of
Lawdar, killing at least one person.

Finally, 11 more MPs from the ruling party
[reportedly](http://twitter.com/#!/WomanfromYemen/status/40785099490328576)
resigned.

Also, an unemployed man reportedly committed suicide Thursday by [setting
himself on fire](http://twitter.com/#!/c0ri/status/40768750898782208).

Protesters in Yemen have called for political reforms and the resignation of
Saleh, who they claim looks the other way regarding corruption, poverty and
the violence in the country.

After the fall of Egypt's Honsi Mubarek, Saleh is the second-longest serving
leader with strong ties to the United States to be targeted by protesters. The
US is extremely worried about the number of Al Qaida members operating in the
country, and Saleh has benefited from the United State's war on terrorism. The
Associated Press [reports](http://www.armytimes.com/news/2010/11/ap-us-
military-aid-to-yemen-110410/) that the US sent $155 million to Yemen in
military aid in 2010.

On Friday, February 25 it looks like things may heat up again. Pro-government
groups are planning a million-man march in Sanaa. A reporter from Yemen told
the Guardian of worries the atmosphere could create
[hostility](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/feb/24/libya-gaddafi-
turmoil-obama#block-22) between the marchers and the students sitting-in on
the outskirts of town. Unions also
[announced](http://www.yementimes.com/defaultdet.aspx?SUB_ID=35559) they would
continue marching against the government, demanding more help for basic goods
and to improve the security situation.

In other moves to try to placate the opposition, Saleh also
[suggested](http://yemenonline.info/news-1965.html) forming a government of
national unity to form until the upcoming elections in 2013. Saleh has been in
power since 1979, and he recently promised not to run in the 2013 Presidential
election.

Commentator Jane Novak dismissed the rumors of a new government of national
unity:
