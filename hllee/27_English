Did you know that Rwanda has the [highest proportion of women in
parliament](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/which-country-has-highest-
proportion-women-parliament)? Or that the lyrics of Nigeria's national anthem,
[“Arise, O Compatriots”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arise,_O_Compatriots),
are a mix of words taken from the five best entries in a national contest? The
countries that make up the continent of Africa are much more than the doom and
gloom portrayed in western media, but many of these facts don't receive any
coverage.

17-year-old Nigerian student Isima Odeh
([@IsimaOdeh](http://twitter.com/IsimaOdeh)) plans to change that through
Africa Facts Zone, a facts brand designed to give people refreshing tidbits
about Africa and Africans. He created[ Africa Facts
Zone](https://twitter.com/AfricaFactsZone/) in 2013, and it has over 55,000
followers on Twitter and over 124 likes on Facebook page.

During a brief email conversation, Odeh told Global Voices that he came up
with the idea in 2013 when he decided to use some of the time he spends on the
Internet to tell people about his beautiful continent. He gets his facts from
newspapers, history books, news from reliable websites, and watching the news.
Something he says he did not know before he started his initiative is that
Africa has the lowest divorce rate in the world.
