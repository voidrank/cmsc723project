Portugal's Constitutional Court has [struck
down](http://www.tribunalconstitucional.pt/tc/acordaos/20130187.html) [pt]
austerity measures considered necessary by the government to meet the
conditions of its 78-billion-euro (101 billion US dollars) bailout program,
[opening a gap](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/05/us-portugal-
austerity-court-idUSBRE9340VJ20130405) of 1.3 billion euros in the country's
2013 budget.

The court, which reviewed the constitutionality of the measures at the request
in early January 2013 of President Cavaco Silva and all opposition parties,
announced that it had rejected four of this year's budget's nine contested
measures on April 5, 2013. It ruled that wage and pension cuts as well as
reductions to sick leave and unemployment benefits violated the country's
[constitutional
principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Constitution) of equality
and fair distribution of fiscal burden.

Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho [warned](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-
europe-22058461) that the government will now have to find spending cuts
elsewhere to make up the deficit.

Portugal [opened its doors for the
“troika”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/03/portugal-adrift-with-a-
bailout-in-the-works/), formed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
European Central Bank, and the European Commission (EC), on April 6, 2011 to
bailout the country's public debt. The Portuguese people, after nearly two
years scraping by with austerity and economic recession, reacted to the
court's ruling harshly.

In light of the year's now dysfunctional state budget, having had parts of it
struck down in April, Max writing on the blog Informação Incorrecta
[claimed](http://informacaoincorrecta.blogspot.pt/2013/04/portugal-decisao-do-
tribunal.html) [pt] that the government has two options: asking the troika for
“more time to meet budget deficit targets” which should reach this year 5.5
percent of the GDP, or asking for one more bailout tranche:

> o chumbo do Tribunal representa talvez a única possibilidade para chamar em

the Court's admonishment perhaps represents the only possibility [for the
government] to call into question someone else's responsibilities and to
invoke a new aid from IMF-EU-ECB.

Let it be clear: a second bailout would be a tragedy and the hope is that the
troika agrees to concede more time for Portugal to achieve the budgetary
targets. Personally I hope to be wrong. But we must not forget that the
country has an economy in recession, an unemployment [rate] that doesn't get
any better (and it wont in the near future), huge interest rates that must be
paid, falling tax revenues. And in the coffers there is not a penny.

On blog Aventar, Jorge “Fliscorno”
[argued](http://aventar.eu/2013/04/07/o-primeiro-ministro-faltou-ao-pais/)
[pt] that the prime minister “knew from the outset that the budget would not
be constitutional” but used it as a strategy to achieve a goal:

> Passos Coelho [anunciou](http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/passos-faz-
> declaracao-ao-pais-1590464) que precisa de ir buscar a outro lado o dinheiro
> que previa sacar ilegalmente aos portugueses. (…) Ficou com um pretexto para
> prosseguir a política que tem levado a cabo desde que foi eleito e
> completamente em oposição ao que prometeu enquanto oposição e em campanha
> eleitoral. (…)
>
> O Primeiro-ministro deste país faltou novamente à palavra e anunciou mais
> cortes na segurança social, saúde, educação e empresas públicas.

Passos Coelho announced that he needs look elsewhere for money that he
expected to take illegally from the Portuguese. (…) He has the excuse to go on
with the policy that he has undertaken since being elected and in complete
opposition to what he promised while in opposition and in electoral campaign.
(…)

The prime minister of this country has once again gone against his word and
announced more cuts in social welfare, health, education, and public
companies.

It was “the D week for Portuguese politics”,
[wrote](http://www.crisisrepublic.com/hard-rain-is-coming/) journalist Tiago
Carrasco on The Crisis Republic blog. In fact, in the days before the
Constitutional Court's decision became known, Minister of Parliamentary
Affairs [Miguel Relvas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Relvas), who is
the prime minister's
[controversial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Relvas#Controversies)
right-hand man, resigned, and the main opposition Socialist Party presented a
[motion of no-
confidence](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323916304578400761232254382.html)
against the government in the Parliament, which ultimately failed.

But as Carrasco said, “the real motion of no confidence [would] come at the
end of the week” with the analysis of the 2013′s annual budget. He predicted
that “the coalition government will probably fall”, an idea already shared by
many, including labor unions, opposition party politicians, and citizens:

> First because it’s the second time [the government] would deal with a
> Constitutional error. Second, they would face an [sic] huge popular protest.
> And finally (and the most important one) the internal coalition is already
> rotten with centrists PP’s [[People's
> Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_and_Social_Centre_%E2%80%93_People%27s_Party)]
> deputies disagreeing often with liberal’s measures and many discussions
> about the minister’s recasting.
>
> So Portugal calmly waits for the announced political collapse.
