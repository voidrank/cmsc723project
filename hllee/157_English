[ _all links in Italian unless otherwise indicated_ ]

The debate surrounding the construction of [a new railway line linking Turin
to Lyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin%E2%80%93Lyon_high-speed_railway
"Torino-Lione Railway") [en], which faces fierce opposition from the [“No to
Tav” movement](http://www.notav.eu/ "Sito NoTav in italiano"), has turned
increasingly bitter and an upsurge in protests has brought the affair into the
political and media spotlight.

Since 1991, this protest movement, made up mainly of inhabitants of Valle di
Susa in Piemonte, has opposed the construction of a high speed (treno altà
velocità, or TAV, in Italian) railway line between Turin and Lyon. According
to its opponents, the TAV project is not only [pointless and
costly](http://www.notav-
valsangone.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13&Itemid=27) but
will also prove environmentally, socially and economically damaging to the
area and its inhabitants, given that construction of the railway line will
destroy a wide swathe of the countryside, leaving several villages changed
beyond all recognition and resulting in the closure of small local businesses.

The Italian government and the European Union are determined to press ahead
with what they consider a strategic project, as it will eventually link
Northern Italy with Eastern Europe. The mayors and inhabitants of the
communities affected insist that the construction of a new railway line is
completely unjustifiable, given that goods traffic on the existent line is
minimal. The project is due to cost the Italian state 30 million euro at a
time when its citizens are tightening their belts in response to the current
crisis.

Suppression of the opposition movement by the forces of order has been
particularly severe over the last few months. Following clashes last summer,
work on the railway line was restarted on February 27 with the eviction of
protesters from their camp and the fencing off of private land without due
legal process.

During a recent demonstration against the dismantlement of the movement's
camp, one of the best known members of the movement, [Luca
Abbà](http://www.notav.eu/article6048.html "Luca Abba' sul sito "), was badly
injured when he fell off a pylon, from a height of around ten metres. As a
result, a halt to construction was requested. In the video which follows,
which is also available on the [YouReporter.it](“http://www.youreporter.it/”
"YouReporter.it") website, police officers burst into a bar after
demonstrators blocked off a motorway, and proceeded to ID everyone present.

Police action of this kind and attempts in the national media to characterise
opponents of the TAV as “violent”, have been interpreted by many netizens as a
excuse to delegitimise the movement as a whole. On his blog [Le Parole e le
Cose](http://www.leparoleelecose.it/?p=3703#comment-23368) (Words and Things),
for example, Mauro Piras writes:

> Il problema non è più prendere posizione. Pro o contro la TAV (o il TAV? la
> divisione passa anche per le parole, i No TAV della valle usano il
> maschile). E non è neanche quello dei “gruppetti di violenti” contrapposti

It's no longer a question of picking sides. Whether you're pro or anti TAV […]
And it's not even a question of “small radical groups” versus a “peaceful
majority”. This characterisation is ingenuous or false. It's something deeper,
something that escapes those of us who are middle-aged, middle-class and, dare
I say it, centre-left.

The debate has, by now, spread throughout the country, moving from [centri
sociali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_center#Italy) (non-profit
community spaces, used for a variety of local activities and often centres of
political and social dissent) [en] to schools. Students have also decided to
demonstrate, as explained on the website [Rete della conoscenza](“) (Web of
Knowledge):

> Crediamo che quest'operazione della polizia avesse come unico obiettivo
> quello di criminalizzare e screditare un movimento che aveva organizzato una
> grande manifestazione pacifica (…).  
>  La battaglia No Tav, non è solo una lotta di un popolo in difesa di una
> valle ma è una lotta di tutti coloro che credono che il territorio sia un
> bene comune da difendere e non da sfruttare per interessi economici, per
> questo torneremo in Val Susa e saremo sempre al fianco di chi lotta contro
> le opere inutili.

We believe that the sole aim of the police operation has been to discredit and
criminalise a movement which had organised a large, peaceful demonstration(…).  
The battle against the TAV isn't just for people fighting to defend their
valley but for everyone who believes that the countryside is communal heritage
to be defended and not to be milked for economic gain, it's for this reason
that we will go back to the Val Susa and we will always stand alongside those
who fight unnecessary development.

The Twitter debate has also been very heated. One of the critics of the the
“No TAV” movement, [@Axell](https://twitter.com/#!/Axell), writes:

> Gli studenti NO TAV dei licei che oggi hanno bloccato Porta Nuova e zone
> limitrofe sanno dove è la Val di Susa? #SiTav #aveterottoleballe

Do the NO TAV secondary students who blocked Porta Nuova station and
surrounding areas today even know where the Val di Susa is? #SiTav
#aveterottoleballe (you're complete pains in the arse)

Among its supporters, however, were
[@fulviomassa](https://twitter.com/#!/fulviomassa):

> “inizia ora la passeggiata verso la Baita Clarea” [where TAV construction
> work was due to start] forza!

“The road towards Baita Clarea starts here” come on!

Antonio Ballestrazzi ‏ [@pesce2802](https://twitter.com/#!/pesce2802):

> #sitav #notav spiegatemi bene,per migliorare il trasporto delle merci
> prosciughiamo i fiumi che servono a irrigare i campi che le producoono

#sitav #notav Let me get this straight, in order to improve the transportation
of goods, we're going to drain the rivers that irrigate the fields where
they're produced?

[@uomoinpolvere](https://twitter.com/#!/uomoinpolvere):

> ma com'è possibile che pure a un sondaggio mediaset il 70% sono #notav e in
> parlamento e sui giornali sono tutti #sitav? fatevi due domande

When even a Mediaset survey finds that 70% of people say #notav, how is it
possible that the newspapers and the parliament are all #sitav? Ask yourself
two questions

Reasons for expressing solidarity with the demonstrators varied. The No Tav
movement was placed in the context of [the current crisis in
Europe](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/01/07/eurozone-
crisis-2011-citizen-media-responses/) [en] on the blog
[Uninomade](http://uninomade.org/):

> Il No Tav è un movimento dentro la crisi e contro l’austerity, i suoi temi
> centrali sono dichiaratamente la lotta ai tagli, al debito e sul welfare.
> Non contro lo sviluppo e la modernità, ma per lo sviluppo dell’autonomia
> della cooperazione sociale contro lo sviluppo capitalistico che tenta di
> imbrigliarla o distruggerla.

The No Tav movement is born of the crisis and opposed to austerity, its
central messages are the fight against cuts, against debt and in favour of the
welfare state. Not against development and modernity but in favour of the
development of autonomous social cooporation rather than capitalistic
development that tries to hold back or destroy cooperation.

[Antonio Negri](http://uninomade.org/a-proposito-delle-lotte-in-val-di-susa/),
issued the following invitation to dialogue, which compares the movement to
the global [Occupy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement "Occupy")
[en] movement:

> Qualsiasi persona calma e tranquilla che non viva nel ricordo ossessivo
> degli anni ’70 come certi nostri dirigenti sembrano vivere, sa che trattare
> è possibile ed evitare radicalizzazioni inopportune e pericolose è utile. Ma
> per farlo bisogna che la politica in Italia rinasca e non può rinascere che
> dalla presa di parola di coloro che, resistendo, aprono a tutti la speranza
> di una nuova partecipazione democratica.

Any calm and reasonable person who, unlike certain of our leaders, is not
stuck in the 70s knows that negotiation is possible and that avoiding
inopportune and dangerous radicalisation is useful. But in order for this to
succeed, politics in Italy must change and can only be reborn when people
speak out and resist and thus gives everyone hope for a new democratic
participation.

Throughout the country, solidarity with, and and actions in support of the
Valle di Susa, have emerged, including the “Blocchiamo tutto” (Blockade
Everything) initiative on the 1st of March when the main stations in Rome and
Bologna and other key railway intersections were blockaded. Meanwhile
[demonstrations in support of the movement](http://www.notav.info/post/notav-
international/) have spread across Europe, including to the French end of the
proposed Turin-Lyon line.

[Anonymous Italia](http://anon-news.blogspot.com/ "Sito di Anonymous Italia"),
a hacker collective, has also swung into action, first blocking access to the
Carabinieri's website and then to the official sites of the government, the
Vatican, Trenitalia [National railway company] and Equitalia [National fine
collector agency]. Below are some reactions to their actions:

> Baruda:  
>  #Anonymous e #Trenitalia: niente da fare, io li amo! TANGO DOWN #OpItaly
> wp.me/pfk0G-2dj #notav

Baruda:  
#Anonymous and #Trenitalia: no bones about it, I love them TANGO DOWN #OpItaly

While the judiciary is investigating several demonstrators, charged after the
most recent protests, the affair remains uncertain and controversial. The
hashtag [#notav](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23notav) is more popular on
Twitter, while [I Fratelli di TAV](http://vimeo.com/fratelliditav "I Fratelli
di TAV su Vimeo") (Brothers of the TAV) are uploading a series of videos on
Vimeo about the movement's history, events and dynamics, including the
following video of the blockade, on the 29th of February this year, of the
Turin to Bardonecchia motorway:
