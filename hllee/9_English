On Tuesday, September 22, minor clashes broke out between refugees and police
at a transit camp in eastern Croatia. Officials have yet to explain the cause
of the scuffle.

According to Sven Milekić, a reporter for Balkan Insight, [33
refugees](http://www.balkaninsight.com/Event/Refugee_Crisis_Live_Updates/189497490)
fled the camp immediately after the violence and their current whereabouts are
unknown. Milekić also cites the Croatian NGO Centre for Peace Studies, which
says Croatian police used tear gas against the refugees, injuring at least two
children, who were reportedly administered emergency care by Croatia's Red
Cross.

In the meantime, the leaders of several Balkan states have opened discussions
about the ongoing refugee crisis on several levels, while the relationship
between Serbia and Croatia grows more strained.

Particularly unhelpful to easing these tensions is the Hungarian government's
decision to erect a new wall and several fences along some of its borders, in
an attempt to stem the flow of newcomers.

Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanović “warned” Serbian officials at a [press
conference](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/croatian-pm-convinced-
ser/2144894.html) on September 23 that “acting against Croatia would mean
acting against the EU.” Milanović explained:

> Croatia is an EU member. Serbia cannot, even if it wants, impose measures
> against Croatia as it has an agreement with the EU. Whatever Serbia does, or
> thinks to do, would be against the EU and I'm sure Serbia will not do that.

Milanović's statements seem to have irritated Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica
Dačić, who
[responded](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&mm=09&dd=23&nav_id=95524)
by saying that Croatia “has not learned lessons from the problems, so far,”
claiming that Milanović “continues to provoke Serbia with his statements.”

Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić also [called Croatia's
decision](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&mm=09&dd=23&nav_id=95528)
to close its borders with Serbia temporarily a “brutal violation of the SAA
that Serbia signed with the EU, that is absolutely unilateral.”

Some analysts and members of the international community are beginning to
argue that the European Union is exaggerating the crisis presented by the
influx of refugees from the Middle East. Critics say the EU is failing to
involve non-EU countries that have a stake in the matter in the plans and
resolutions made to handle the crisis, perhaps adding fuel to the already
troubled Balkan region.

Analyst and professor of Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz
Florian Bieber [wrote a piece](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/europe-
s-inertia-has-made-a-crisis-of-an-influx-09-23-2015) for Balkan Insight, where
he describes the European Union's handling of the crisis from a Balkan
perspective:

> The damage caused by governments in their response to refugees has been
> tremendous. Within weeks, borders across the region have been come more
> tightly controlled and closed than they have been for over a decade. […]
>
> The response of Balkan countries along the transit route has reflected the
> conflicting signals coming from Germany and other core EU states, which have
> oscillated between welcome and rejection.
>
> The divergent responses by these governments has put pressure on bilateral
> relations, in particular between Hungary and its two southern neighbors, but
> also between Serbia and Croatia and Slovenia.

Fredrik Wesslau, another expert on European foreign policy and the director of
the Wider Europe Program for the European Council on Foreign Relations,
[called
attention](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_eu_should_bring_the_western_balkans_into_the_refugee_2025)
to these issues in a piece published just two days before the conflicting
comments from Serbian and Croatian officials. Wesslau wrote:

Freelance journalist Jorgen Samso, who spent some time in the Balkans just
prior to the explosion of the current refugee crisis, coined a term that might
best capture what refugees traveling the “Balkan route” are now experiencing:
the “Balkan Border Shuffle.” This new dance craze, as it were, moves from
border to border, with no way back. Samso [describes for
Politico](http://www.politico.eu/article/migrants-forced-to-do-the-balkan-
border-shuffle/) the added confusion that already desperate refugees now
confront:

> The confusion has trickled down to the refugees making their way north to

Disagreements between the leaders of the European Union are growing more
apparent by the day. As Fredrik Wesslau notes, things are bound to get much
worse before they get better and both EU and non-EU countries affected by the
huge influx of refugees in Europe are looking to the EU for solutions. At this
point, recent decisions by EU leaders seem to be more successful at rekindling
old animosities than resolving the current crisis.
