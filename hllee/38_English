Efforts in the tiny West African state of the Gambia, which hasn't been
affected by the devastating Ebola outbreak, are being intensified to protect
the country from the deadly virus.

As of 31 August, nearly 1,900 people in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra
Leone have died, [according
](http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_09_04_ebola/en/)to the World Health
Organisation. Following the confirmation of[ the first Ebola case in
Senegal](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/29/first-ebola-case-in-
senegal), the Gambia's immediate neighbour, concerns soared over the country's
preparedness and public awareness about the disease. The confirmation created
[widespread fear](http://allafrica.com/stories/201409050568.html) among the
Gambians because of the closeness of Senegal to Gambia and porous borders
between the two countries.

A coalition of civil society in the Gambia have launched [Ebola Free
Gambia](http://www.ebolafreegambia.gm/) to try and keep the country Ebola
free. Its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ebolafreegambia?fref=ts),
created on the 30 August, has over 2,900 likes.

A description of the coalition on its website says:

> In light of the proximity of Gambia to the Ebola infected areas, there is a
> pressing need for immediate action to arrest the possible spread of Ebola
> into The Gambia by sensitizing the population about the nature of the
> disease, how it is spread and how to avoid being infected. The Government of
> the Gambia from the onset of the outbreak in West Africa has taken some
> steps to protect our country from Ebola. The impact of the Ebola outbreak in
> West Africa already having dire economic consequences to the Gambia not to
> mention the potential health implications if the disease were to spread into
> the Gambia.

The campaign complements government's efforts by raising awareness about
preparedness, prevention and response using their website, YouTube videos,
Facebook and sensitization drives around the country.

Meanwhile, on 11 September the US Embassy in Banjul in collaboration with
Gambian artists [launched a
song](https://soundcloud.com/usembassybanjul/ebolasong) dedicated to the
[crusade against Ebola](http://allafrica.com/stories/201409152508.html). “The
Ebola Song” features musicians [Tra, Badibunka, Cess Ngum, Killa ACE, &
Sandeng, and Amadou
Sussocebook](https://www.facebook.com/U.S.EmbassyBanjul/photos/a.10150634223410531.691731.189280505530/10154603435530531/?type=1).
Listen to it below:

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Banjul has already established a
24-hour information hotline from any network within the country.
#EbolaFreeGambia campaign is different from the efforts by the Ministry of
Health to sensitize Gambians.

The news of first Ebola case in Senegal prompted Gambian Facebook user Arfang
Jobe to [suggest
that](https://www.facebook.com/groups/198553840154883/permalink/848885978454996/?comment_id=848892505121010&offset=0&total_comments=7)
mobile phone companies partner with the Ministry of Health to send text
messages to raise awareness about the disease.

Commenting on the suggestion, Hassan Njie
[cautioned](https://www.facebook.com/groups/198553840154883/permalink/848885978454996/?comment_id=848919708451623&offset=0&total_comments=8):

Mobile phone companies have started sending Ebola related messages to
subscribers. However, It is not clear whether this initiative is the direct
result of the Ebola free campaign on social media.

In August, researchers at Oxford University
[announced](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-28966419) that they will begin a
trial of a potential vaccine on healthy UK volunteers once ethical approval is
granted, which will eventually extend to the Gambia and Mali. This
announcement has since been received with mixed feelings in the Gambia with
some being skeptical.

But some are more optimistic and would like [the trial to go
ahead](https://www.facebook.com/groups/198553840154883/permalink/848778871799040/?comment_id=848819731794954&offset=50&total_comments=80)
in the Gambia:

Whatever the case may be, the fact is that many people in the country are
worried about the deadly virus entering the country.
