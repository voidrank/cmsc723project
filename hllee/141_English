Iranian bloggers reacted with humour to the Syrian rebels
[attack](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/18/syria-rebels-kill-elite-
damascus) in Damascus and the bomb blast that killed three top security chiefs
in the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad's regime.

Iran and Syria enjoy excellent relations and netizens have resorted to poking
fun at how impacted the Iranian regime would be should Al Assad finds himself
out of power, following the 16 month revolution raging in Syria.

with irony:

> If Bashar gets killed, the Iranian regime will call him a martyr and change
> the name of a highway in Tehran in his name…In our history books, in
> schools, they will talk about Assad's oppressed family and in primary school
> they will add a lesson called “Assad's legend”.

> After the victory of Bashar Assad's opposition, we should make us ready to

And Farda Iran Azad [writes](http://farda-iran-azad.blogspot.cz/) [fa]:

> The fall of the Ba'athist regime in Syria happens when our country faces a
> huge political, economic and social crisis.[These two events] can and should
> lead us to a popular uprising….this time our freedom movement should not be
> limited to middle class [as it happened in 2009 protest movement].

Freedom Messanger [imagines](http://www.facebook.com/Freedom.Messenger) how
Iranian Leader, Ali Khamenei's condolences letter for Bashar Al Assad would
look like. The imaginary letter reads:

> With this letter I send some weapons and revolutionary guards in order to
> avoid our dear ones become martyrs….rape and kill non-Alawite Syrians to
> remain in power like me.
