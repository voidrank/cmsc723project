Tens of thousands in Malaysia gathered in Kelana Jaya stadium near the
country’s capital on May 8, 2013 to
[protest](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/05/06/malaysia-outrage-over-
election-outcome/) the final vote tally of the [13th General
Elections](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/04/27/malaysia-which-party-has-
the-best-election-manifesto/). The Opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat won 51
percent of the popular votes but it only got 89 seats against the 133 seats of
the ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN).

Because of its victory, BN is now the [‘world’s longest-ruling elected
coalition’](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/09/last-stand/)
which first came to power in the 1950s. However, it suffered its [worst
defeat](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/09/how-malays-voted-
at-ge13/) since 1969.

News reports estimated the crowd inside Kelana Jaya stadium to be around
50,000 to 60,000. However, Malaysiakini reported that more than [120,000
people](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229564) joined the protest, including
those who couldn’t enter the stadium:

> Including those caught in traffic jams all around Petaling Jaya, the crowd
> is estimated at 120,000 – making it one of the biggest rallies in recent
> times
>
> Despite the drizzle, the crowd is still trickling into the stadium. Cars
> have been parked as far as 2km away and the party doesn't seem to end
> anytime soon for supporters.

This is what Genevieve Nunis
[observed](http://www.lipstiq.com/2013/05/09/ge13-50000-malaysians-form-
malaysian-tsunami-in-mbpj/) in the event:

> The stadium was filled with Malaysians who disagreed with the results on the

> shouting ‘Reformasi’ (reformation) and
> [‘Ubah’](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/04/21/what-malaysians-expect-

> for a free and fair elections
>
> This is truly the act of patriotism. These are Malaysians who do in fact

> an overwhelming feeling? It just might, but the beautiful part about it all
> is that everyone is putting their differences aside, and fighting together
> for their country as one.

The government warned that some of the speakers in the rally could be charged
for [sedition](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229604). The Opposition
announced that [more
rallies](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/anwar-vows-more-
rallies-to-challenge-bn-mandate) will take place in the coming days.

These two videos
[uploaded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0nLQC4MzQs0)
on YouTube show the crowd which assembled in the stadium:

Terence Netto [cited](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229601) the 1986 People
Power in the Philippines when Filipinos marched in the streets and soldiers
mutinied in protest to the election fraud committed by the administration:

Prime Minister Najib Razak attributed the surge in votes for the Opposition to
the support given by Chinese voters. He called it the “Chinese Tsunami’. A
letter writer named [Disappointed
Citizen](http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/229426) criticized Najib:

> Our dear prime minister made a comment about the Chinese voting community
> which broke my heart…I felt that it was rather insensitive of him.
>
> And now to refer to a portion of the people as a “tsunami” that may be
> dangerous for the nation simply because they voted for the opposition seems
> to me to be a rather petty and immature tactic.

But was Najib correct in his analysis? Scholars insist that what caused the
loss of votes for the administration was the overwhelming support of urban
voters to the Opposition. Some call it [‘urban
tsunami’](http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/229531) or ‘Malay tsunami’.

Gertrude Pereira lists some election
[reforms](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229606) that need to be undertaken:

> If it is serious about reconciliation and healing, then be magnanimous.
> Clean up the electoral roll, reform postal balloting, provide free and fair
> access to the media, clearly indicate that the next elections will be on a
> level playing field and call for GE14 earlier rather than later. And keep it
> clean.

Ramesh Rajaratnam argues that it’s the election system that is deeply
[flawed](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/229578):

> Without a concerted effort from our MPs to make our country fairer by
> insisting on equitable representation in Parliament, it will indeed be very
> difficult for Najib to ask for national reconciliation when the very premise
> of his assertion was fundamentally flawed.
>
> If you don't know what's broken, how can you fix it?

Dr. Syed Muhd Khairudin Aljunied heralds the rise of a [new
breed](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/09/how-malays-voted-
at-ge13/) of Malay voters:

> GE13 has laid bare the end of money politics and made it plainly obvious
> that the days of old school racial politics are numbered. The new breed of
> Malays have their eyes now set on cosmopolitan leaders, regardless of which
> party they are from, leaders whose forebears have had Malay interests in
> mind and, above and beyond that, the interests of all Malaysians at heart.

[Just Read!](http://justread-whatever.blogspot.com/2013/05/accept-defeat-
anwar.html) is against the decision of the Opposition to organize a protest
rally:

> Whether there were flaws or not during the just concluded 13th general
> election, it was a good start to a ‘clean and free’ election in the country;
> and with due respect Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, please accept the decision of
> the voters!
>
> Be a true gentleman, be a good Opposition Leader and take your team on the
> right and proper function as a constructive opposition rather than mocking
> at each and very policy the government introduced.

[tunku](http://tunkuaisha.blogspot.com/2013/05/top-stories-anwars-post-
ge13-strategy.html) also thinks the same about the Opposition leader:

> He may not be good at winning elections, but Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is
> very good at whipping up his crowds of supporters and trying to persuade the
> world that he is a victim of injustice

Through the hashtag
[#mywant](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mywant&src=typd), some Malaysians
called for [national
unity](http://elections.thestar.com.my/story.aspx?file=/2013/5/9/nation/13088543#.UYs-
GbVTA5o) and harmony:
