Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung, located in North Sumatra, has
[erupted](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140109-volcano-
mount-sinabung-erupting-indonesia-ash-
lava/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=link_tw20140109news-
mountsina&utm_campaign=Content) more than 200 times since last year and has
already [displaced](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/mt-sinabung-volcano-
erupts-30-times-as-20000-displaced/) more than 20,000 villagers. The volcano
has been [dormant](http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2013/11/21/206531575/Central-
Javas-Sleeping-Volcanoes-Potentially-Active--) since the 1600s.

Volcano Discovery provides the latest volcanic
[activity](http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/sinabung/news.html#.Us9Prbks8Ic.twitter)
of Sinabung:

> The actively growing lava dome, being a mass of unstable, moderately viscous
> lava, frequently collapses in parts and produces hot bloack and ash
> avalanches (pyroclastic flows) that reached up to 4.5 km distance. According
> to the latest figures, the number of refugees from the 5-7 km exclusion zone
> has reached approx. 25,000.

Indonesia, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, has more than 100 active
volcanoes. But Carl believes Sinabung will only lead to [medium
size](http://volcanocafe.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/the-road-to-sinabung/)
eruption:

> The magmatic system under Sinabung does not in any way contain enough magma
> for a supereruption.
>
> Since so little is known about this volcano it is probably a good idea to
> look at the surrounding volcanoes to get an idea of what might be in store.
> Just a few kilometers away is the double volcano system of Mount
> Sibayak/Mount Pinto, and that might give a good clue at what might be in
> store.

[Evacuations](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/authorities-warn-residents-
against-returning-to-villages-near-mount-sinabung/) have been ordered by
authorities who also assured affected residents that aid will be delivered
promptly to those who are in temporary
[shelters](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/01/06/worst-case-scenario-
being-prepared-mt-sinabung.html). But aside from displacing villagers, the
eruption of Sinabung made a tremendous negative impact on the local
agriculture.

Utami Irawati expressed solidarity to those affected by the eruption:

> Thoughts and prayers for people around Sinabung. Stay strong, and I
> sincerely pray that things will get better soon :”(
