In early April, three MPs from the opposition political force “Svoboda”
[[“Freedom”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/10/31/far-right-party-
performs-strongly-in-ukrainian-vote/)] [registered a bill](http://en.for-
ua.com/comments/2013/04/12/150012.html) that would ban abortions in Ukraine.
The only exceptions foreseen in the proposal included cases when the pregnancy
threatened a woman’s life, when a fetus had grave pathologies, and when the
pregnancy was proven to have resulted from rape. This initiative comes only a
year since the Ukrainian lawmakers’ last
[attempt](http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine_femen_protest_abortion/24543934.html)
to ban abortions.

In the [explanatory
note](http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=46457) to the bill,
the authors of the proposal justified the need for such restrictions with the
following arguments [uk]:

> Despite the declining tendency, the level of abortions in Ukraine remains
> among the highest in Europe and amounts to 21.1 abortions per 1,000 women of
> childbearing age; 45.8 abortions per 100 pregnancies or 84 abortions per 100
> births.
>
> […]
>
> It must be noted, that [when the previous regulations on abortions were
> adopted] the following fact was not taken into consideration: according to a
> series of scientific medical researches, a child that is being aborted
> experiences the same level of suffering as a grown up person who is being
> tortured to death. Moreover, abortions have negative consequences on the
> psychological and physical health of all those involved.
>
> […]
>
> In most [regions] of Ukraine, the number of deaths is nearly three times the
> number of births. During the last 20 years, the population of Ukraine has
> decreased by 5 million people (from 52 to 47 million). If such demographic
> dynamics persist, in a few years immigrants, mostly from Asia, would
> constitute the majority of the Ukrainian people.
>
> One of the major reasons behind such discontenting demographic tendencies is
> the legality of abortions.

The lawmakers also stressed the negative attitude toward abortions
[shared](http://lenta.ru/news/2013/04/08/svoboda/) [ru] by all Christian
churches of Ukraine.

The proposal has proven quite controversial and sparked active discussions
both online and offline.

Many commentators immediately focused on the issue of proving the occurrence
of rape in court. Reporters of a major Ukrainian TV channel, TSN, noted that
only 10 percent of rape charges become court cases and asked Olexandr Sych,
one of the bill’s authors, what a woman should do if she became pregnant but
failed to prove the fact of rape. The MP

Many users addressed the moral and ethical aspects of abortions. In
particular, such a discussion took place on the Facebook page of a physician
and activist Evgeny Komarovsky.

Currently, abortions in Ukraine are legal until the 12th week of pregnancy
(the 22nd week in emergency cases). Ukraine is one of the leading countries in
Europe in the [annual number of
abortions](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/mapeuropeabrate.html),
although there is a clear downward tendency. “Abortion tourism” from the
neighboring countries where the laws are more restrictive, such as Poland, has
also been [documented](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/women-come-for-
abortions-30549.html).
