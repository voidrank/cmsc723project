“We demand the gov't imports 328 dairy cows & replace the parliament with
them,” tweets Hayder Al-Khoei, who [shares
](https://twitter.com/Hayder_alKhoei/status/637963787988017152)this sign held
at a recent protest in Iraq. The cows are more useful, he adds.

Iraqis have been taking to the streets of the capital Baghdad and other cities
across the country every Friday for the sixth week in a row to protest against
widespread government corruption and lack of basic services. It all started
when Iraqis had enough from the frequent power cuts, as summer temperatures
hit 50 degrees Celsius.

The demonstrations reached a peak on Friday the 28th of August after the call
of religious Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to his followers to join the anti-
corruption protests. This increase was promising, however less people showed
up last Friday.

@HayderSH says he saw an ‘obvious decrease’ in number:

Reportedly, 15,000 people demonstrated on August 28 in the capital Baghdad,
and many other cities across the country, mainly focused in the southern
provinces. The protesters carried Iraqi flags and held banners with critical
slogans towards corrupt officials and politicians, such as ‘where is our
money?’. Some also carried lights with the word ‘civil’ written in it,
demanding their basic civil rights.

While the demands of the protesters began small, such as calling for improving
the lack of electricity and clean water amid a heat wave of more than 50
degrees Celsius, they are now more complex. Protesters now urge Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi to carry out major measures. The first demands were given a
enhancement when Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani called on August
7 for Al-Abadi to take measures against the political corruption.

As a [response,](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/world/middleeast/protests-
in-iraq-bring-fast-promises-but-slower-changes.html?ref=topics&_r=1) the
minister proposed a set of political reforms and measures, such as the
elimination of several senior government positions, the end of sectarian
quotas in politics, and the elimination of corruption.

However, [he
only](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/world/middleeast/protests-in-iraq-
bring-fast-promises-but-slower-changes.html?ref=topics&_r=1) fired three
deputy prime ministers and a few ministers, and ordered security forces to
ease access to Baghdad's Green Zone, leaving the protesters distrustful and
even more determined. On August 28, the Prime Minister came with another set
of measures to ensure “social justice”.

With several Shitte clerics urging their followers to join the demonstrations,
the protests had gained more weight. In a televised speech on August 24, Al-
Sadr’s spokesperson read a statement
[saying](http://www.thearabweekly.com/?id=1682):

> “We announce to all people and to the Sadrists in particular the need to
> participate in protests this Friday in Baghdad.”
>
> “The Sadrist participants should merge with the other protesters in a
> single, national Iraqi crucible.”

Even though the call resulted in attracting more people to protest, some also
questioned Al-Sadr’s support, pointing out his political role as the leader of
the political party, the Sadrist Movement, and wondering why he is not
changing the political system from the inside out.

The anti-corruption protesters got a lot of support on social media like
Twitter and Facebook.

Also the military, who has been instructed not to crackdown on the protests,
showed support towards the demonstrators.

The anti-corruption movement has gotten Sunnis and Shiites together, with some
people even calling for a complete political reform and the establishment of a
secular state.
