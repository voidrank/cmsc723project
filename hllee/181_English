Accusations of an Iranian [plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador in
the United States](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/13/opinion/iran-hawks-
justin-logan/index.html?hpt=hp_mid) has captured the front page of websites
and newspapers around the world. The U.S. Department of Justice has announced
charges accusing two Iranians of trying to hire who they believed was a member
of a Mexican drug gang to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. Iran denies the
charges. Iranian blogger opinions on this “stranger than fiction” story are
diverse as ever.

The blogger adds any [Iranians] who wish for Iran to get attacked are
traitors.
