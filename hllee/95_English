Thousands of ethnic [Amharas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhara_people) in
western Ethiopia are [being expelled](http://ethsat.com/2013/04/02/forcefully-
evicted-ethiopians-say-are-helpless/) en masse from the country's [Benishangul
Gumuz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benishangul-
Gumuzhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benishangul-Gumuz) region, where many have
settled, in what some are condemning as a campaign of “[ethnic
cleansing](http://ecadforum.com/News/request-for-an-immediate-investigation-
in-to-the-forced-eviction-of-amharas/)“.

[Ethiopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia) has been divided into nine
ethnically based and politically autonomous [regional
states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Ethiopia "Regions of
Ethiopia") and two chartered cities since 1996. The Amhara people, reportedly
including children, pregnant women, and the sickly, are being
[uprooted](http://ethsat.com/2013/04/02/forcefully-evicted-ethiopians-say-are-
helpless/) to a rural area of Ethiopia's[ Amhara
region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhara_Region), which contains their
historical homeland.

Human rights advocates say the deportation is
[illegal](http://ethsat.com/2013/04/03/an-intl-lawyer-says-the-forced-
eviction-of-amhara-is-an-ethnic-cleansing/) according to Ethiopian and
international law. Ethiopian authorities have
[maintained](http://www.mfa.gov.et/weekHornAfrica/morewha.php?wi=933#933) that
these claims are unsubstantiated, saying that they have been moving and
resettling indigenous and local farmers in the name of
[villagization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resettlement_and_villagization_in_Ethiopia)
programs.

This isn't the first time Ethiopian officials have forced Amhara people to
move to another region. A reported 22,000 Amharas [were
evicted](http://www.ginbot7.org/2012/04/03/ginbot-7-condem-the-ethnic-
cleansing-and-the-sacrilegious-of-waldeba-monastery-by-the-meles-zenawi-
regime/) from southern Ethiopia and their [homes
confiscated](http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/37258) in 2012.

A report by Ethiopian Satellite Television in March 2013 and made available on
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YmWAmXKXOEs)
[amh] quotes opposition party leaders condemning the eviction.  

Many Ethiopians are opposed to the government policy of the rural population's
mass eviction. An online petition, demanding the government stop the
resettlement campaign, had 1,919 signatures at the time of this post's
publication on April 11, 2013.

The [petition page](http://www.change.org/petitions/the-federal-democratic-
republic-of-ethiopia-stop-the-eviction-of-ethiopians-from-their-settlements),
which is addressed to [Dr. Chaloka
Beyani](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/IDPersonsIndex.aspx),
the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons,
and many other Ethiopian government high officials, reads:

> According to the information that I have, the eviction is poorly organized
> and is marred by several cases of human right violations. This petition is
> in protest of this eviction and is intended to get the plight of these
> voiceless Ethiopians to the attention of the Ethiopian government and
> international rights organizations. Please sign the petition and invite your
> friends to sign as well. This is the least we can do to show our solidarity
> with Ethiopians who are being victimized by a misguided and irresponsible
> policy.

on his Facebook page about the reasons behind the mass evictions of the
Amharas:

> Its my view that the mass eviction at this time has well calculated
> political agenda and is being hatched by the real power holders. By
> instigating attack on vulnerable Amharas who reside outside their regional
> state, the regime would like to stir ethnic victim-hood sentiment. This is
> meant to force Amhara political leaders to resort to open ethnic partisan
> advocacy, which would undermine their pan-Ethiopianist narrative. What does
> the regime benefit from this?
>
> Since the 2005 election, the TPLF [Tigray People's Liberation Front, one of
> Ethiopia's political parties and the real dominant player in Ethiopia
> politics although the ruling party is Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
> Democratic Front (EPRDF)] has been trying hard to transform its ethno-
> nationalist narrative to that of statist nationalism. That is it wants to
> justify its continuous rule by presenting itself as guardian of the
> Ethiopian state and its historical legacy. However, before it can achieve
> that, it has to displace the previous claimant–the Amhara elites. Hence such
> surgical attack on their ethnic brethren would eventually force Amhara
> elites to embrace ethno-nationalism and give up the throne of Ethiopian
> nationalism to the new claimant- Tigrean elites.
>
> The sad thing is while the rulers experiment with all kind of dirty tricks
> to prolong their days in palace, innocent and poor farmers struggling to
> survive on a dollar a day income are pushed around. Making these farmers
> homeless at the time when people are barely surviving at their home due to
> the unbearably high cost of living is a heartless crime that sets a
> dangerous precedent, that must be condemned by everyone, in regardless of
> who we are or what political opinion we have.

Blogger Ephrem Eshete [asked ](http://www.adebabay.com/2013/04/blog-post.html)
[amh] Ethiopians to strongly denounce the evictions:

> **ሊወገዝ የሚገባው ተግባር** መነሻው ምንም ይሁን ምን፣ የክልሉ ፓርቲ ከማንም ጋር ይስማማ አይስማማ በነዚህ ዜጎች ላይ
> የተደረገው ተገቢነት የሌለው ነገር ነው። የዜጎች በአገራቸው ውስጥ የመዘዋወር፣ የመኖር መብት እንዲህ በጥቂት የፓርቲ
> ሹመኞች መወሰኑ የሚያስጨንቅም የሚያስደነግጥም ምልክት

> This action should strongly be denounced. The parties administering their
> respective regional states might have agreed on terms [for evictions] but it
> is wrong regardless of the reasons for the uprooting of these citizens of
> Ethiopia. It is alarming as well to know Ethiopian citizens’ rights to
> movement in their country is decided by political party officials.

Abraha Desta, an activist based in Tigray, Ethiopia
[identified](https://www.facebook.com/abraha.desta2/posts/453792154706701)
[amh] three reasons for activists to support the Amhara people:

> ሰዎች ከቀያቸው በሃይል (በግፍ በዘርሓረጋቸው እየተለዩ) ሲፈናቀሉ (ሲባረሩ) የከፋ የሰብኣዊ መብት ጥሰት ነው። ዜጎቻችን
> (ወገኖቻችን) ሲፈናቀሉ የሚደርሳቸው ኢኮኖሚያዊ፣ ማሕበራዊና ስነልቦናዊ ቀውስ (Helplessness) መገመት ኣይከብድም።
> ሁሉም ኢትዮዽያ ሊተባበራቸው ይገባል፤ መንግስት ይህን ተግባሩ እንዲያቆም ተፅዕኖ ማድረግ ኣለብን።
>
> እኛም እየተፈናቀሉ ካሉ ሰዎች ጎን መሰለፍ ያለብን ይመስለኛል። ምክንያቱም (1) ወገኖቻችን ናቸው። እኛ ኢትዮዽያውያን
> ያልደረስንላቸው ማን መጥቶ ይረዳቸዋል? (2) ዛሬ በኣማራ ተወላጆች እየተፈፀመ ያለው ግፍ (ኣሁንኑ ካልቆመ) ነገ
> በእያንዳንዳችን እንደሚፈፀም ማወቅ ይኖርብናል። (3) የማፈናቀል ተግባሩ የብሄር ፖለቲካ ችግር ኣባብሶ የጥላቻ ፖለቲካ
> ስር ሰዶ የኢትዮዽያ ሀገራችን ኣንድነት የሚፈታተን ይሆናል።

> The following should be our reasons to stand by the sides of our fellow

> not stop here by now we should know that tomorrow it is going to happen to

However, Mesfin Negash
[warned](https://www.facebook.com/mesfin.negash/posts/10151383864957339) [amh]
that these acts should not be taken as acts of a certain ethnic group against
another ethnic group but rather acts of people who don’t have any sense of
decency:

> የዛሬ አፈናቃዮች በብሔረሰብ ካባ ለመደበቅ ቢሞክሩም ሕግ ፊት የሚቀርቡበት ቀን እንደሚመጣ አምናለሁ። ተፈናቃዮዩቹ በሙሉ
> የአማራ ብሔር ተወላጆች ቢሆኑም አፈናቃዩ ወገን ግን የየትኛውም ብሔር ወኪል እንዳልሆነ እናስታውስ፤ አደራ። ግፈኞቹ፣
> መዝባሪዎቹ፣ ወሮበሎቹ፣ ሆድ አደሮቹና ዘረኞቹ አፈናቃዮች ብሔራቸው “ነውር” ነው። ነውረኞች።

> Today’s culprits of these mass evictions are trying to paint their acts and
> hide under ethnicity, but I believe a day shall come when these people will
> stand before a court of law. Though the evictees are Amharas, we should
> believe the perpetrators are not representatives of a certain ethnic group.
> Please be reminded that the ethnicity of wrong doers, looters and racists is
> indecency!

Correction: An earlier version of this piece included an image from the
petition site that we believed was from 2012 of evicted Amharas. The image has
since been deleted, a reader traced the original image to [this article
published in
2010,](http://seattletimes.com/html/thebusinessofgiving/2010777229_gates_foundation_makes_major_g.html)
according to which Amharas in the image are seeking loans. Apologies for the
error.
