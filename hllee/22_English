Over the past three decades Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East, has
suffered from chronic underdevelopment and a socio-economic crisis. Over 60
per cent of Yemen's total population (25 million) are in dire need of
humanitarian assistance, with children and women mostly affected.

The precarious humanitarian situation was exacerbated further in the four
years of political instability following the revolution in 2011, which ousted
President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Long before the war broke out on March 25, the
United Nations and International organisations have been warning of the
looming humanitarian crisis.

The dire humanitarian situation worsened with the conflict between ousted
President Saleh-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition backed by the
US, Gulf states, Egypt and Turkey. While the coalition airstrikes mainly
targeted military camps and weapon depots (some of which are in residential
areas), it also targeted airports in Sana'a, Aden, Hodeida and Sada'a.

On Monday, Al Marzaq camp, an Internally Displaced People's [(IDP) camp, was
reportedly struck by the Saudi led coalition
strikes](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/air-strike-refugee-camp-
houthi-controlled-northern-yemen-kills-at-least-21), killing at least 40
internal refugees and injuring 200. Yemen's UN Humanitarian coordinator
Johannes Van Der Klaauw deplored the attack in a
[statement](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HC%20deplores%20attack%20on%20Al%20Mazraq%20IDP%20camp.pdf)
and called on all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law. According
to [UNICEF,](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_81408.html) at least 62
children have been killed and 30 injured during fighting in Yemen over the
past week.

Meanwhile, Saleh-backed troops and Houthi militias have been advancing in
Southern Yemen, brutally attacking civilians and aggressively bombarding
residential buildings. Southern cities have been ravaged for weeks, which has
only worsened the humanitarian situation. [Doctors without Borders/Medecins
San Frontieres (MSF)](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-
medical-supplies-and-personnel-unable-reach-conflict-areas) reported receiving
more than 550 patients since March 19, as a result of clashes in Aden, Lahj,
and other areas in the south. On March 26 alone, 111 patients arrived at the
hospital.

Amnesty International in a
[statement](https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/03/yemen-civilians-
burn-to-death-in-further-airstrikes/) accused the coalition of turning a blind
eye to civilian deaths and suffering.

Under International Humanitarian Law, it is forbidden to launch attacks that
might lead to incidental losses among civilians or cause the destruction of
civilian objects that would be disproportionate to the concrete and direct
military advantage anticipated.

Amid the no-fly zone imposed on Yemen by the Arab coalition, international
organizations called for the urgent removal of obstacles to enable them to
deliver medical supplies and trained health personnel urgently needed in
Yemen.

Due to the no-fly zone, many [Yemenis have been stranded in countries across
the world](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/03/31/yemens-no-fly-zone-
thousands-of-yemenis-are-stranded-abroad/), which prompted Yemeni netizens
such as Khaled al-Hammadi to launch the hashtag

Many people in Yemen don't have access to clean water, and are struggling to
feed themselves and lack proper infrastructure, basic health care and
education. Yemen's young generation have witnessed many wars in their short
lives and are tired of its horrors and humanitarian toll. They launched a
hashtag saying “enough” to war
[#KefayaWar](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KefayaWar&src=tyah) to all sides
of the conflict.

Ammar Al-Aulaqi addressed them all in a tweet:

> Kefaya means “enough”. Yemenis are speaking to all: Coalition

Other Yemeni activists and journalists highlighted the humanitarian plight and
hardship Yemen is facing from this war.

Global Voices has covered Yemen's humanitarian crisis over the years:

  * [Yemen: Millions Go Hungry in Ongoing Food Crisis](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/05/21/yemen-millions-go-hungry-in-ongoing-food-crisis/)
  * [Yemen: Pressing Humanitarian Needs and Deteriorating Economic Situation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/09/yemen-pressing-humanitarian-needs-and-deteriorating-economic-situation/)

Yet the humanitarian aspect of the war doesn't seem to matter to nor make
headlines in mainstream media. IRIN warned that the humanitarian situation
will only become severe due to the conflict.

> The humanitarian situation in
> [#Yemen](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yemen?src=hash) is dire, a civil war

In summary, the humanitarian crisis that international organisations have been
warning about over the past years has just been exacerbated over the past week
of war in Yemen and will continue to do so. The question now is, what will the
world do about it and when?
