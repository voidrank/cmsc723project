After a two-day blackout, internet services [resumed
](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20566387) on Saturday in and
around Damascus and in major cities according to press reports from inside
Syria.

The communications outage made it difficult to follow the situation on the
ground as fighting reportedly intensified between pro-government and rebel
forces, especially in the area close to the Damascus international airport.

With the conflict showing no signs of abating and communications becoming
increasingly difficult or unreliable, a “[spontaneous campaign of
solidarity](http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/172720) [ar] with the silenced
Syrian people,” started on the internet.

In a show of support for the Syrian people, netizens started tweeting under
the hashtag [“#هنا_دمشق”](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/12/01/from-
jerusalem-to-damascus/), Arabic for
[#This_Is_Damascus](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23this_is_damascus&src=typd).
During these times of siege and blackout, people from cities around the world
are invited to offer Damascus a temporary refuge.

The campaign is a reminder of the “From Damascus… This is Cairo!” call, that
was broadcast from Syria at the height of the [Arab-Israeli war of
1956](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis) when French and British
fighter jets, eager to prevent the nationalization of the Suez Canal by
Egypt's Nasser, attacked Radio Cairo transmitters, successfully silencing
Egyptian broadcasts.

> #This_is_Damascus is the most thoughtful, touching, and historically-rich
> hashtag that has come out for the Syrian revolution thus far.

Some people inside Syria were also able to join the campaign. As in 2011,
Google and Twitter re-activated [Speak To
Tweet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_To_Tweet), a service that allows
users to post an audio tweet by calling a designated international phone
number and leaving a voice message, like this anonymous caller who simply
called to say:

> “[This is
> Damascus!](https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/s2t/getaudio/ALzLAKoveW460s2RRvmD6ObHpAQj4gS8FJR6-Kq53Kua52pOXIKk9yNDjZ5x3YgyvKftJ72NnnfURsaJDnjPktmLThRKy6bGkAh3GnSbCj0JwZbByB1WGjJIt2Wr9NowjgFxXeMD1vT2)“
