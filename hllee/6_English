When the Brazilian poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade wrote “[Lira
Itabirana](http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/livros/rio-doce-sobrevive-nas-
poesias-cronicas-romances-cancoes-18053688)” in 1984, he certainly didn't
think of it as a prophecy. “The river? It's sweet. Vale? Bitter”, the poem
goes.

On 5 November, [the collapse of a dam belonging to mining company
Samarco](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2015/11/1706510-tragedia-em-
minas-gerais-deve-secar-rios-e-criar-deserto-de-lama.shtml), a joint venture
between Vale (Brazil) and BHP Billinton (Australia), poured an avalanche of 62
billion liters of mining waste into the Rio Doce (the “sweet river”) watershed
in the southeastern region of Brazil. “If only the load was lighter,” Drummond
de Andrade wrote 30 years ago.

After flowing more than 600 kilometers down the Sweet River, bringing despair
to several cities bathed by it, the mud [started to empty into the Atlantic
Ocean in the week](http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/samarco-tem-24-horas-
para-impedir-chegada-da-lama-ao-
mar,2297d4cbb1a7881d6c3d3ecf17437b20p5nv0ngq.html) of 23 of November.

And if the impact of the toxic waste on the riverbed was extremely worrying,
experts warn that the damage to the marine ecosystem could be even bigger,
since it is more vulnerable than its terrestrial counterpart. Biologist André
Ruschi, director of the school Biologic Station Augusto Ruschi in the state of
Espírito Santo, says that the damage could be equivalent of [“decimating the
Pantanal](http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/noticias/2015/11/151120_impacto_lama_mariana_oceano_lgb),
the world's largest tropical wetland area.

The mouth of the Sweet River is close to a nesting ground for the leatherback
sea turtle, the biggest turtle species to inhabit the Brazilian coast. The
timing couldn't be worst: November is mating season for those turtles. The
[Tamar Project](http://www.tamar.org.br/) has taken the initiative to move the
nests away from the beach, but no one is sure of what the longer-term effects
will be, since turtles always come back to the same place to lay their eggs
year after year.

### Chronology of an ecocide

The collapsed dam, called “Fundão”, is located on the eastern part of Minas
Gerais state near the city of Mariana. Around Mariana lies Bento Rodrigues, a
village home to 600 people that was completely engulfed by the toxic avalanche
and risks disappearing off the map. Seven people have died and 12 are still
missing, nine of whom are Samarco employees.

The mud merciless swam down the Rio Doce, hitting other towns and reaching the
state of Espírito Santo. In total, about 800,000 people were affected by water
supply interruptions in those places.

Samarco and Vale managed to deliver 250,000 liters of water in tank trucks to
the population of Governador Valadares, home to 240,000 people (the largest
population center in eastern Minas Gerais), but the water was soon discovered
to contain large amounts of [kerosene](http://g1.globo.com/mg/vales-
mg/noticia/2015/11/valadares-descarta-240-mil-litros-de-agua-da-vale-com-teor-
de-querosene.html), making it unsuitable for drinking.

This was not the only clumsy attempt by Samarco to mitigate the impact since
November 5. In the week after the dam collapsed, the company gave a press
conference asserting that the mud wasn't toxic, but two lab analyses conducted
by the towns of Governador Valadares and Baixo Guandu [detected high levels of
iron and other metals](http://noticias.r7.com/minas-gerais/lama-de-barragem-
deixa-800-mil-sem-agua-em-minas-e-no-es-11112015) such as mercury in it.

[Experts
explained](http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/noticias/2015/11/151120_impacto_lama_mariana_oceano_lgb)
that even if the composition of the waste isn't toxic in itself, the mud acts
as a “sponge”, attracting other pollutants to the river.

The state governor of Minas Gerais, Fernando Pimentel, of the ruling Workers’
Party, gave a press conference in the headquarters of Samarco itself,
defending the company and asking for “caution” before pointing fingers. The
governor's attitude attracted criticism from citizens. Fabrício Costa, who is
from Minas Gerais, commented on [his Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1031394193550717&set=a.197222633634548.44488.100000404393305&type=3):

The Brazilian press has had [restricted access to affected
sites](http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/brasil/2015/11/18/internas_polbraeco,507025/acesso-
restrito-as-barragens-da-samarco-trava-investigacao.shtml), controlled by
Samarco. The citizens of the villages hit by the mud have been removed to
hotels, which also makes press access difficult since visiting hours are
controlled. All the clean-up work is being conducted by Samarco/Vale, who,
until now, still hasn't explained the causes of the accident.

The federal government has established a fine for Samarco of R$250 million
(US$70 million). In 2014, the [company had revenues

### The end of the Rio Doce?

The Mariana disaster is already being nicknamed the “Brazilian Fukushima”. The
shocking images of the devastation, the lack of answers about the causes of
the accident and the passive attitude of the federal and state governments
have scandalized and angered the public.

The little village of Bento Rodrigues, unknown to many Brazilians, became the
center of a national debate on Brazil's apparent failed environmental
policies. An old video showing life in Bento Rodrigues before the tragedy has
made the rounds on Facebook throughout the past week:

About the video, columnist for O Globo newspaper Cora Ronai [wrote on her
Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/cronai/posts/10205995103331261):

The toxic mud contaminated land and water, killing a large part of the fauna
and flora in its path. Biologists and ecologists fear that it might alter the
course of the river and its fauna forever, since the mud will likely settle on
its riverbed, altering the morphology of the water. Worries that endemic
species from the region might go extinct are also circulating.

Luiz Carlos Azenha [uploaded a video to Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/145344364) of
dead fish in the river:

[Biologist Maurício Ehrlich told newspaper Folha de São
Paulo](http://m.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2015/11/1706510-tragedia-em-minas-
gerais-deve-secar-rios-e-criar-deserto-de-lama.shtml?mobile) that the mud
might transform the river banks into “deserts of mud” and that the
reconstitution of the soil might take hundreds of years (the geological
timeframe for a new soil to form).

But if Brazilian authorities are accused of a lack of leadership to mitigate
the impacts of the disaster, ordinary citizens promptly took the matter into
their own hands. Residents, fishermen, scouts and biologists set up operations
nicknamed “Noah's Arc”, salvaging different species from the river before the
mud arrived. Neighboring cities also quickly donated water to the towns hit by
the waste.

The Independent Group for Analysis of Environmental Impact (GIAIA) created a
Facebook group to mobilize a [task force of citizen
scientists](http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/noticias/2015/11/151117_mariana_cientistas_cidadaos_cc.shtml),
guiding those interested on the basic protocols for collecting water samples
from the river, so that they could independently analyse its quality later on.

GIAIA also launched a
[crowdfunding](http://www.kickante.com.br/campanhas/relatorio-independente-de-
impacto-causado-pelo-rompimento-das-barragens-de-fundao-e) campaign to cover
the costs of an independent study of the environmental impacts caused by the
mud. In a few days, the groups raised more than R$70,000 (US$18,000), almost
50% above its original target.

Citizen efforts aside, many are pointing out that it's crucial to punish those
responsible for the tragedy: [online
petitions](https://secure.avaaz.org/po/petition/Todas_as_autoridades_e_diretores_da_Vale_e_Samarco_Justica_para_Mariana/?pv=5)
have been circulating demanding from the company and the government justice
for victims, and the hashtag #NotAnAccident (#NãoFoiAcidente) has been
appearing on social media in the past weeks.

### #NotAnAccident

Minas Gerais literally translates to “general mines”. The name is no accident:
since colonial times, mining activity has been crucial to the public revenue
of this state, which prompted a cosy relationship between government and
extractive industries.

This relationship is even more evident in the cities closer to the mines
themselves. [About 80% of the public revenue of the city of
Mariana](http://g1.globo.com/ciencia-e-saude/noticia/2015/11/rompimento-de-
barragens-em-mariana-perguntas-e-respostas.html), for example, comes from the
Germano mine, owned by Samarco. However, in the whole of Minas Gerais state
there are only four public inspectors to supervise more than 700 waste dams.
According to one member of the Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB),
[Minas Gerais has at least 50 dams under alert for risk of
collapse](http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/cidadania/2015/11/em-mariana-
familias-sem-organizam-para-planejar-o-futuro-9954.html).

On 18 November, the company acknowledged that two other dams in the region,
Santarém and Germano, [risk collapsing as
well](http://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/samarco-admite-risco-de-rompimento-em-
mais-duas-das-barragens-18072191). The Germano dam, the largest of them, is
the one in the most critical state.

The newspaper of the [Institute of Arts and Social Communication of Fluminense
Federal University](http://jornalocasarao.com/2015/11/13/governador-valadares-
reflexos-de-um-rio-morto/) highlighted a technical report from 2013, requested
by the state prosecutor's office of Minas Gerais, that warned of the risks of
collapse among Samarco dams.

They also pointed out that Australian BHP Billinton was involved in a [similar
disaster in Papua New Guinea in the
1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ok_Tedi_environmental_disaster), where
billions of liters of mining waste were poured into the river Ok Tedi,
affecting the lives of about 50,000 people.

Vale, the other company behind Samarco, also isn't just some small enterprise.
It's the third biggest mining company in the world by some measures, with
operations on five continents. Originally a state company, it was privatized
in 1997 in a [process allegedly clouded by irregularities that were never
investigated](http://www.cartamaior.com.br/?/Editoria/Politica/Maior-
escandalo-de-corrupcao-da-Historia-do-Brasil-foi-a-privataria-tucana/4/31796).

Though both companies, in theory, have know-how when it comes to disaster
management, they have been accused of using Samarco as a shield to distance
themselves from the media after the tragedy.

Accident or not, the pain of the people is clear. In the minidocumentary “Doce
Rio” uploaded a week ago, Governador Valadares native Caíque Castro
[assures](https://vimeo.com/145527950) that “with all we're going through,
faith must not falter”.
