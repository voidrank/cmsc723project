A military coup at the hands of Burkina Faso's presidential security guard has
pulled the country into a deep political crisis. On September 16, 2015, ex-
President Blaise Compaoré’s [Regiment of Presidential Security
(RSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment_of_Presidential_Security) held
President Michel Kafando, his Prime Minister Isaac Zida, and the rest of the
government in detention, before shutting down the political transitional
institutions.

[Kafando](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Kafando) and his ministers were
set free on September 18 and talks about reinstating Kafando are
[ongoing](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/burkina-faso-return-civilian-
rule-coup-150920000308857.html). In the course of these events, the coup
plotters named General Gilbert Diendéré, longtime aid to Compaoré, new leader
of the country.

Clashes also erupted in the capital Ouagadougou, resulting in at least [three
dead and 60 injured](http://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/afrique/coup-d-etat-au-
burkina-faso/burkina-faso-un-militaire-annonce-la-destitution-du-president-et-
la-dissolution-du-gouvernement-transitoire-suivez-la-situation-en-
direct_1087573.html).

This coup’s intended objectives are clear if one looks at the background, the
perpetrators and their relationship to those who were formerly ruling the
country. The latter don’t seem to have given up their eagerness to regain
power, notwithstanding [the Burkinabé people’s expressed
refusal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuxi%C3%A8me_r%C3%A9volution_burkinab%C3%A9e)
in 2014 of a further unconstitutional extension of Blaise Compaoré’s regime
after 27 years in office.

This movement, known as the Balai Citoyen (the citizen's broom), is once again
leading this resistance against the coup leaders. Whatever the outcome of this
coup, in the short or the long run, it certainly constitutes an attempt to
infringe on the will to establish a long-lasting democracy in the country.

The following three questions shed some light on the coup and will be
important to keep in mind as the situation unfolds.

### **Who are the RSP coup leaders?**

The Regiment of Presidential Security RSP is a branch of [Burkina Faso's
military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_Burkina_Faso) in charge of
protecting Burkina Faso’s president, the country's republican institutions and
any person designated by the president of Burkina Faso. The RSP was created by
Blaise Compaoré as a way to assert authority after the assassination of Thomas
Sankara, Compaoré's predecessor. The RSP is known for its substantial weaponry
and is autonomous and separate from any other armed force, since it
exclusively operates under the president’s command.

[Thomas Sankara](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sankara) was the
charismatic leader of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987. He was known and well-
liked for his anti-colonialist and pan-Africanist policies. He was overthrown
in a coup led by [Blaise
Compaoré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Compaor%C3%A9 "Blaise
Compaoré") on October 15, 1987, and assassinated shortly after (although it
remains unclear whether Compoaré was directly involved in the killing).

A principal figure in the RSP and de facto interim head of state, Gilbert
Diendéré, was also actively [involved in the
coup](http://www.lefaso.net/spip.php?article63183#forum724713) that deposed
Sankara.

The guard had made their displeasure for the new government known before the
coup. In June 2015, the RSP demanded that the prime minister step down before
giving up on that tactic. On September 14, one of the transitional
institutions known as the Commission for National Reconciliation and Reforms
(CRNR) in turn urged that the [RSP be
dissolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment_of_Presidential_Security).

The coup leaders have imposed a night curfew as well as shut down land and air
borders.

### **What does this have to do with the upcoming elections?**

The presidential and legislative elections were supposed to take place in
Burkina Faso on October 11. In an interview with [Jeune
Afrique](http://www.jeuneafrique.com/265138/politique/exclusif-general-
gilbert-diendere-sommes-passes-a-lacte-empecher-destabilisation-burkina/),
Gilbert Diendéré made a case for the coup as follows:

> Nous sommes passés à l'acte pour empêcher la déstabilisation du Burkina-
> Faso” en raison de l'insécurité pré-électorale

> We decided to take action to prevent the disruption of Burkina Faso due to
> the insecurity looming during pre-elections.

However, this excuse does not seem to hold water and is simply a way for the
RSP to take advantage of this unrest in order to reestablish the preceding
regime by force. As a matter of fact, previous adherents to Compaoré were kept
away from the upcoming elections.

Furthermore, [the autopsy
results](http://www.jeuneafrique.com/265324/politique/burkina-resultats-de-
lenquete-lassassinat-de-thomas-sankara-devaient-etre-devoiles-17-septembre/)
expected to shed light on Sankara’s assassination were supposed to be
published on September 17, the day of the coup. The autopsy took 30 years to
(almost) come to fruition because the authorities had never allowed an
independent committee access to the body. The autopsy results are still held
secret as of today.

It’s like witnessing a second “death” of Sankara, probably perpetrated by the
same actors (Compoaré and his RSP guards). It seems that in the light of these
events, Compoaré and the RSP will again be held responsible by the Burkinabé
people.

### **Will the citizen resistance make a difference?**

The [Balai Citoyen movement
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Balai_Citoyen)(Citizen's Broom movement),
initiated by Burkina Faso’s youth, was an important element in the October 30,
2014, popular upheaval which toppled Compaoré. On that day, tens of thousands
of demonstrators took to the streets of capital city Ouagadougou and other big
villages, headed for the authorities’ headquarters.

On announcing the coup on September 16, spontaneous opposition demonstrations
took place in the streets of the capital. A radio station, [Radio de la
Résistance Citoyenne](https://www.radioking.fr/radio/radio-de-la-resistance-
citoyenne) (Citizen's Resistance Radio), was set up to call on activists to
take action against the RSP’ attempt to take power.

The hashtag [#lwili](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lwili&src=tyah) (lwili
means “little bird” in Mooré, the most widely spoken language of Burkina
Faso). was created to share the latest news updates on the crisis as well as
promote various citizen's initiatives. Here are some images and reactions:
