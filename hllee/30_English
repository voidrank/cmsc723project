Those, in case you were wondering, are the 60-plus countries—and counting—that
will be represented at the [Global Voices Citizen Media Summit
2015](https://summit2015.globalvoicesonline.org/).

In seven weeks’ time, on January 24, hundreds from the four corners of planet
Earth will gather at the venerable Cebu Provincial Capitol in Cebu City,
Philippines, to spend two days together exploring the connections between the
open Internet, freedom of expression and online civic movements around the
world.

Since 2006, [Global Voices
Summits](https://globalvoicesonline.org/about/annual-summits/) have brought
together the most innovative and inspiring digital activist and citizen media
communities from around the world. These meetings have proven a rich breeding
ground for ideas and collaborations across borders. At the 2015 Summit we also
look forward to continuing that tradition—as well as celebrations for our 10th
anniversary.

This year's [program](https://summit2015.globalvoicesonline.org/program/) will
feature panels, short project showcases, open “unconference”-style sessions
and hands-on training workshops with some of the leading voices in digital
rights and international citizen media. And as part of the process we'll be
facilitating real-time online participation as well as capturing, translating
and publishing the knowledge and conversations coming out of the meeting.

If you'd like to join us in Cebu City, please
[register](https://summit2015.globalvoicesonline.org/register/) through the
Summit web site. The registration fee is PHP 2,000 for residents of the
Philippines, [US$50](https://gvsummit2012.eventbrite.com/) for residents of
South East Asia outside of the Philippines, and [US$75
](https://gvsummit2012.eventbrite.com/)for international participants.

If you can't join us, we'll be streaming portions of the program live on
January 24-25, 2015. And keep an eye on the [Summit web
