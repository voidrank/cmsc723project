In 2006, after eight years of various reforms, lowering the state debt and
government deficit in order to meet [the Maastricht
criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria), the Slovak
voters [decided it was time to take a
break](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_parliamentary_election,_2006). But
the new PM, [Robert Fico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fico), under
pressure from businesses, [changed his pre-election
stance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fico#Domestic_policy), kept the
deficit under 3% of the GDP, and [in January
2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia#Economy) Slovakia entered the
[Eurozone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone).

But from that moment, in fact like many other euro-countries at that time and
before, Fico stopped being afraid of increasing government spending without
increasing its income, which resulted in 8% deficit in 2009. One can
understand that in the case of a small economy, especially the one tied with
the German economy, this was the result of an overall situation in the world.
Still, Fico's opponents like to recall his 2008 words: “Slovakia will be not
taught by the crisis.”

Then the news of the Greek problems with their high external debt, [largely
owned by the German and French
banks](http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/german-banks-have-big-
investment-in-greece/), began to appear. Popular was an interview with
[Stefanos Manos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Manos), published [in a
Czech newspaper](http://www.lidovky.cz/recka-nemoc-by-se-dala-vylecit-rychle-
dvn-/ln_noviny.asp?c=A100123_000052_ln_noviny_sko1), in which he described the
alarming situation in the Greek state sector: high wages, combined with
lifetime job guarantees, pensions nearly at the level of wage base, over-
employment in state-owned companies. Later also [came the
reports](http://www.finance.sk/spravy/finance/33078-financie-napriek-krize-
berlin-a-pariz-podporuju-grekov-vo-vydavkoch-na-zbrojenie/) of [Greece's
continuous military
spending](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Greece#Military_spending).

The [unflattering portrayal of
Greece](http://i.sme.sk/cdata/3/55/5514063/grecko_shooty-r153.jpg) in the
Slovak media did not stop Maximos Dragounis, a Slovakia-based ethnic Greek
blogger, from [describing Greece's debt
history](http://dragounis.blog.sme.sk/c/228109/Clanok-jedneho-Greka-Grecky-
problem-uvedeny-na-pravu-mieru.html) in these terms: “[[Konstantinos
Karamanlis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantinos_Karamanlis)] … started
the process of running Greece into debt … Factories and companies that Greece
did not need were being built.”

By the time of [the 2010 Slovak
elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_parliamentary_election,_2010),
it was very popular to compare Fico's policies to the Greek ones (e.g.,
promises of the “13th pension”). The opposition, as expected, was calling the
government to act responsibly, but a significant deficit had been created even
before the elections.

After the European meeting, the PM came up with a plan to help Greece
financially, by increasing the Slovak deficit by another 1.4% of the GDP. The
opposition was
[critical](http://richardsulik.blog.sme.sk/c/228264/Nehoraznost-menom-pomoc-
Grecku.html) of this so-called solidarity with Greece, arguing that it was an
irresponsible step. So, before the parliamentary elections, when the PM's bloc
had the majority of seats, it did not find the courage to approve such an
unpopular measure. In fact, Fico's party did not vote for it also after the
elections. The newly created government kept its original line from the
opposition times and promised to lower the deficit under 3% of the GDP in a
few years – and did not approve a loan for Greece.

Slovakia came under pressure from the [European Central
Bank](http://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html) (ECB) because of its refusal
“to participate in the Greek bailout.” [According to
Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE68915I20100910), ECB's
president [Jean-Claude Trichet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-
Claude_Trichet) said that ECB would not support “future euro zone applicants
if there is a risk they will do something similar.”

A recent [comment in a Slovak
newspaper](http://komentare.sme.sk/c/5545769/trichetove-hnevy-a-masla.html)
alleged that under Trichet's leadership, ECB was buying Greek bonds to help
the French banks that had been involved in financing the “Peloponnese
adventure”. Also, the German chancellor [Angela
Merkel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) allegedly changed her
negative opinion on a loan for Greece for the same reason. And ECB's annual
2008 report, published in April 2009, contains no alarming indications of the
impending Greek collapse.

[A Slovak version of the Reuters
report](http://ekonomika.sme.sk/c/5544023/trichet-krajinu-ako-slovensko-uz-do-
eurozony-neprijmeme.html) has generated over 1,400 comments, mostly of this
kind:

The most popular opinion [under the Czech
version](http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/211159-kdyby-se-vedelo-ze-
slovensko-nepomuze-recku-do-eurozony-by-je-nepustili.html):

> Roman Mrózek, Bohumín:

> A poor country must run into debt to help a richer country?

Finally, a [blog post by Lukáš
Buček](http://lukasbucek.blog.sme.sk/c/241019/Slovensko-von-z-eurozony.html),
titled “Slovakia, get out of the Eurozone”:

> Yesterday we were entertained or outraged by Jean-Claude Trichet, chief of
> the European Central Bank. He said that if ECB had known that we would act
> this way, they wouldn't have accepted us to the Eurozone.
>
> Let's have a closer look. Euro stays on three pillars:
>
> 1\. Adherence to the [[Stability and Growth
> Pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact)]  
>  2\. ECB is not buying state bonds of Eurozone members  
>  3\. No bailout clause, which means prohibition of saving member-countries
> by interstate loan.
>
> We are criticized by France and Germany. Both countries have already
> violated the Stability and Growth Pact, which they were not able to adhere
> to; specifically, they had problems with the 3% public deficit. Greece
> officially fulfilled the criteria for entering the Eurozone on June 19,
> 2000, but today we already know that this hadn't happened actually.
>
> We are criticized by Jean-Claude Trichet. He, as the chief of ECB, is
> responsible for the fact that ECB has violated the second pillar by buying
> Greek bonds.
>
> We are criticized by the rest of the Eurozone, but we are the only member-
> state that hasn't violated the “no bailout” clause. Is it normal that they

>
> And what do we have to pay for? The Greeks have had absurd arms expenditures
> in peace time, the 2009 budget of the Greek Ministry of Defense was 6.582
> billion Euro, for this year they have lowered it to 5.73 billion.
> [[OECD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD)] countries spend the average of

> What's interesting is that I can't find anywhere any acknowledgment by the
> EU, Eurozone or ECB of their regrets for having accepted Greece…
