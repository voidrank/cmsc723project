If the United States’ [immigration
law](http://m.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/08/03/startup-stories-coming-america)
had ever been similar to the one France recently decided to apply, Yahoo would
have been a Chinese company (founded by Jerry Yang from Taiwan), Google would
now be a successful Russian business (set up by Sergey Brin) and Apple would
have been a Syrian enterprise – the father of Steve Jobs was a foreign student
when his son was born.

What's more, if the University of Hawaïï had not given Barack Obama Sr. the
opportunity to study in the US, his son would probably not be here today.

**Immigration debate**

A political debate has been going on in France since beginning of September
2011. Minister of Interior and President Sarkozy's former Chief of Staff,
Claude Guéant, signed in May 2011, cojointly with the Minister of Work and
Social Relations, Xavier Bertrand, a
[circular](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/world/europe/french-to-allow-
work-visas-for-more-students.html) which makes it more difficult for foreign
students who have graduated from French public and private universities to
work on French territory and thus change their student visa permit into a
working visa.

In addition, a decree was signed on September 6, 2011, in order to tighten
conditions for foreigners looking to pursue their higher education in France.

Julie Smith, an American citizen living in France was affected by these new
policies. After she received a deportation letter from the authorities, she
wrote on French information website [Rue
89](http://www.rue89.com/2011/10/25/american-france-what-did-i-do-deserve-
deportation-225917):

> Here is my story of being an American immigrant in France, the story of many
> as immigration policy has tightened under Interior Minister Claude Guéant.
> This policy destroys the lives of many foreigners who have been settled in
> France and have built their lives here for years. It deprives France of
> their real contribution to the economy and is applied in a completely
> illogical and unjust manner.

French and international students mobilised against these new legal steps, as
well as several university chancellors. On October 18, 500 students
symbolically [demonstrated]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRrZWp3Kjvc) in
front of the Sorbonne University in Paris, to protest against Guéant's
policies. To show the absurdity of the measure, they threw their French
diplomas into the garbage.

The following [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFy7fWlROPQ) posted on
YouTube by user

scene:

**Demonstration**

The demonstration was organised by the “Collectif du 31 mai”, an organisation
which gathers foreign students and graduates from French universities. It
counts more than 6,000 supporting members on its [Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/Collectifdu31mai?sk=info).

“La Confederation Étudiante”, the second most important student union in
France, has also mobilised on the issue. The organisation has launched a
[petition](http://www.confederation-etudiante.org/campagnes/petition-pour-le-
retrait-des-mesures-de-c-gueant-contre-les-etudiants-etrangers) asking the
Government to withdraw the measure. It has been signed by more than 2,000
people thus far.

We interviewed Baki Youssoufou, president of “La Confédération Étudiante”. In
the following [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUFCG58jLEw), he explains
the absurdity of the measure, and why he assumes it is related to upcoming
2012 French presidential election:

Some international students assume that the May 31 circular is an opportunity
for them to go back to their countries and help develop them. Kocoumbo, a
Cameroonian student, published an anonymous guest post on Rue 89 entitled
“[African Students, Guéant is helping us: let us dare go back
home](http://www.rue89.com/2011/10/19/etudiants-africains-gueant-nous-rend-
service-osons-rentrer-chez-nous-225689)” [fr]. He writes:

> A cet égard, en dépit des tragédies personnelles des uns ou des autres, je
> ne peux m'empêcher de penser que c'est là un fier service que M. Guéant nous
> rend.

In this regard, despite of our personal tragedies, I cannot help myself
thinking that Guéant is doing us a great favour
