Economists would be hard pressed to forecast the future of Europe's bailouts
and the consequences of the current financial crisis. While opinions differ,
reactions abound online to try to make sense of what future awaits for the
Eurozone.

Where is the economy going? That question was put to Maria Karchilaki, a Greek
journalist and the Foreign Desk Anchor/Correspondent for MEGA TV. She replied:

None of the region’s [biggest

pass a stress test. [BNP

[RBS](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/04/rbs-idUSL6E7M40LK20111104),
even though it is apparently [awash with

italy-banks-ifr-debt-idUSTRE7AA47V20111111) to cut their exposure.

[France](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-05/france-to-lower-deficit-

On the micro level, people are not in a charitable mood, one retired truck
driver in Greece went so far as to [tell The New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/business/global/small-businesses-in-
greece-are-being-devastated.html?hp):

The question, “Where will the economy go over the next two months?” was put to
the following reporters and Twitter users before the resignation of former
Greek Prime Minister Papandreou and former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi.

Efthimia Efthimiou, a Greek journalist, writes:

Yannis Koutsomitis, another journalist, replied:

Right now the outcomes are pointing in this direction: John Reed of The
Financial Times[ writes that](http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2011/11/eurozone-
crisis-live-blog-12/#axzz1dYHkzTnr) Italian tyre producer Pirelli has “drafted
a contingency plan that factors in a 10 per cent drop in car sales and 20 per
cent fall in truck sales globally. That would be a drop as big as that seen
after Lehman Brothers’ collapse.” (Though that's emphasized as a worst-case
scenario.)

Meanwhile, a WikiLeaks cable written in 2010 began to get to work on (if it's
necessary) how one might go about declaring a [‘Eurozone Chapter
11](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/wikileaks-exposes-german-preparations-
eurozone-chapter-11)‘.

Douglas Fraser at the BBC [discusses](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-
scotland-15671526) what would happen if multiple defaults were in the cards:

> But there are indirect effects as inter-bank insurance and lending unravels,

On another FT blog, Alan Beattie [writes](http://blogs.ft.com/the-
world/2011/11/a-cunning-plan-ecb-imf-version/#axzz1dgNH2wXb) that:

> […] if the ECB can’t bring itself to bail out Italy direct (sovereign credit
> risk, no expertise in setting lending conditions) it could in theory,
> according to Article 23 of its protocol, lend vast amounts to the IMF

The IMF would then set about bailing out Italy (which [Megan Greene sees as on
the cards](http://economistmeg.com/2011/11/10/italy-past-the-point-of-no-
return/) (‘bail-in’), as does [The
Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/11/understanding-
euro-crisis) to a degree), which at the end of it all – amongst all this
information – is better than nothing.

Reached by email, RTE's Paul Cunningham said, in answer to the question “Do
you have any hope that the ECB might use its position as a central bank to
encourage growth instead of austerity?”, that (posted with permission from the
