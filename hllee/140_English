Portuguese filmmaker André Soares published a [short video
documentary](http://youtu.be/It9_gHEDgBM) about the [Struga Poetry
Evenings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struga_Poetry_Evenings), an
international poetry festival that has been held annually for half a century,
since 1962, in the town of [Struga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struga),
Macedonia ([the official site](http://www.svp.org.mk/)).

The film features statements by poets [Vladimir
Martinovski](http://www.acrosseurope.eu/writer/5-Vladimir-Martinovski) from
Macedonia, a Chinese exile [Bei Ling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bei_Ling),
[Rati
Saxena](http://www.poeticdiversity.org/main/poets2.php?nameCode=ratisaxena)
from India, [Corey Marks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Marks) from the
United States, [Siim Kera](https://twitter.com/siimkr/) from Estonia, [Mimoza
Sali](http://mimozasali.blogspot.com/) from Albania…who also talked about the
global situation with poetry and read their works in various languages.

While explaining the circumstances of being forced to choose between jail and
exile due to disagreement with the regime, Bei Ling says that his homeland is
no longer China, but the Chinese language. Curiously enough, one of the most
famous quotes by the renowned Macedonian poet and linguist [Blaže
Koneski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bla%C5%BEe_Koneski) (1921-1993),
inscribed on his recently erected
[monument](http://telma.com.mk/index.php?task=content&cat=1&rub=6&item=13159)
[mk], is “our language is our homeland.”

The festival is one of the crucial elements of the official, state-supported
culture, and its opening is usually attended by top political personages, like
the Minister of Culture, Prime Minister and/or the President. As such, it has
not proven conducive to promotion of domestic dissent, as attested by the
[critical post](http://babamitrajanka.blogspot.com/2011/06/blog-post_24.html)
[mk] on the 2009 edition by activist blogger and poet
[Vnukot](https://twitter.com/vnukot). In 2011, he specifically
[returned](http://babamitrajanka.blogspot.com/2011/08/blog-post_31.html) [mk]
to publicly read [his poem](http://v-deko.blogspot.com/2011/09/murder.html)
about the murder of Martin Neshkovski, the event that incited the [grassroots
protests against police
brutality](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2011-special-
coverage/macedonia-protests-2011/) a year ago.

Over the years, Macedonian bloggers have been mentioning the festival by
quoting Wikipedia data and starting discussions about domestic poets such as
[Koneski](http://zoriv.blog.mk/2007/08/23/strushkite-vecheri-na-poezijata/),
[Mateja Matevski](http://makedonskijazikiliteratura.blogspot.com/2011/09/blog-
post_17.html) or Jovan Koteski (1932-2001), who attended in
[1964](http://jovankoteski.blogspot.com/2008/12/1964.html) and
[1981](http://jovankoteski.blogspot.com/2008/05/1981-1982.html), or publishing
Macedonian translations of works by foreign participants, such as the Japanese
[Shuntaro Tanikawa](http://japmk.blogspot.com/2008/05/o.html), the French
[Pierre Béarn](http://documents-mk.blogspot.com/2010/06/blog-post_6349.html),
and Russian [Vadim Fedorovič Terehin](http://literatura-
bella.blogspot.com/2008/02/blog-post_7168.html)
([Ru.wikipedia](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%91%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%BD,_%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC_%D0%A4%D1%91%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87)).

Journalist Vasko Markovski used his blog to publish a
[reportage](http://freedomfanclub.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_14.html) [mk]
on the park of poetry in Struga, where the trees planted by many world
renowned poets grow side by side.
