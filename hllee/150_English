On March 28, 2012, video activist [Ali Mahmoud
Othman](https://threatened.globalvoicesonline.org/blogger/ali-mahmoud-othman-
jeddo), head of the media office of Baba Amr in Homs, was
[arrested](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/04/03/syria-ali-mahmoud-othman-
the-eyes-of-baba-amr-detained/). Fellow activists believe he has been
[subjected to severe
torture](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/31/world/meast/syria-
journalists/index.html) since his arrest. On April 25, Syrian state television
announced an exclusive interview with Othman.

In the preview that was broadcast by state television Addounia, Ali is seen
first inside his cell, and then coming out to talk to interviewer Rafiq Lutif,
accompanied by dramatic music and a headline announcing “Stay tuned… Inside
Baba Amr” (the area of Homs that has faced an onslaught by regime forces).
Recording forced “confessions” of detainees is a very common practice in
Syria, as a way to discourage others from joining the opposition.

The video, which can be seen both on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=425812124114018) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6YRba6VlLo), speaks for itself:

Othman, known among his friends as “Al Jed” (the Grandfather), was originally
a vegetable vendor and has been documenting unrest in Homs since the beginning
of the Syrian uprising. He was instrumental in assisting those covering the
conflict from Baba Amr, [helping evacuate international
journalists](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/31/world/meast/syria-
journalists/index.html) from inside the neighborhood. He decided to stay in
Baba Amr even after the Syrian army re-captured the neighborhood.

An [“online demonstration”](https://www.facebook.com/FREEDOM.ALI.OTHMAN) in
solidarity with Othman has been announced for Saturday April 28 at 9 pm
(Syrian time), with the slogan “We are all heroic activist Ali Mahmoud
Othman”. According to the [Baba Amro
News](https://www.facebook.com/Baba.Amro.News/posts/130281610429404) Facebook
page:

> Syrian media have used Ali and told people to stay tuned for a show that
> will expose “the secrets of Baba Amr”. We know what Ali looked like and we
> knew what his weight was, he has clearly been tortured and treated badly.
> And now he will not be tried in court, no, he will be displayed on TV.

Spanish journalist Mónica G. Prieto tweeted:

> Patético. A Al Jed, jefe del equipo d periodistas ciudadanos de #BabaAmr, le
> obligan a ‘confesar’ sus crímenes en TV

[@monicagprieto](https://twitter.com/#!/monicagprieto/status/195798137179353088):
Pathetic. Al Jed, head of the #BabaAmr citizen journalist team, is forced to
“confess” his crimes on TV

Some netizens have expressed relief at the news that Othman is alive, as there
is still no news of others who have been detained. Free Syrian tweeted:

> [@HamaEcho](https://twitter.com/#!/HamaEcho/status/195989912326111232):
> Activists Noura al-Jizawi and Ali Othman are still arrested, but at least we
> know Ali is still alive. Two Turkish journalists still missing.

Netizens continue to call for Othman´s release through this [online
petition](http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-freedom-f.html).
