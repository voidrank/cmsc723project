Human rights groups have put the latest [death
toll](http://www.presstv.ir/detail/167886.html) in the Libyan crisis to over
6000, as pro-Gaddafi forces continue to pound opposition-held cities with air
strikes.

Much of the fighting appears to be in the city of Brega, although reports
indicate that anti-Gaddafi revolutionaries have successfully repelled the
offensive and are pushing towards the capital, Tripoli.

Evidence that Gaddafi is perpetrating gross atrocities is mounting, with
images and news of human rights violations continuing to seep through social
media. This, for example, is an [**extremely graphic
image**](http://twitpic.com/45i528) of protesters shot dead by anti-aircraft
weaponry currently being circulated on social media.

Thousands of refugees continue to pour over the border into Tunisia, where
temporary camps have been set up by the United Nations Refugee Agency UNHCR to
shelter fleeing foreigners, mostly Egyptians.

Below is raw [footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKd3HW_T-
yk&feature=player_embedded) of fighting taking place on the outskirts of
Brega. Pro-Gaddafi fighter jets can also be heard hovering above the city.

Bloggers in Libya continue to post updates, amidst growing fears for their
safety.

From Tripoli, _[From the
Rock](http://lonehighlander.blogspot.com/2011/03/crowded-mind.html)_ urges the
West to lift sanctions that are cutting off urgently needed funds for ordinary
Libyans to live:

> If you thought that the past two weeks were painful, the future does not
> look less tragic, because with [this mass freezing
> ](http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/28/139557.html)of Libyan assets,
> I'm afraid that the Central Bank will not be able to cover any withdrawing
> of funds from Libyan citizens, which would result in an economic crisis in
> the power of purchase. Salaries may not be accessible if there is no
> liquidity and that would create mass fear.
>
> If there is anyone listening please unfreeze those assets!

_[Khadija Teri](http://khadijateri.blogspot.com/2011/03/normal-day-in-
tripoli.html) _describes life in Tripoli as pro-Gaddafi forces prepare for the
looming battle:

> We drove around the city to see what was happening. Women holding shopping
> bags hurried about with worried looks on their faces. Men wearing green
> scarves around their necks were busy putting up green flags. Pick-up trucks
> with oil-company stickers slapped on the sides but without licence plates
> were parked at roundabouts, doors and windows open to reveal uniformed men
> with machine guns inside. A huge crowd of people were at the port waiting to
> board a ship that would evacuate them to safety. Anti-aircraft guns were
> placed at various places along the coast road. The weather was beautiful but
> no one was enjoying the day. The whole atmosphere was weird, it felt as if
> you were being watched or followed. It felt as though any second something
> horrible could happen – it felt unsafe.

> I'm getting tired of staying at home. The kids want to go back to school

Libyan tweeps are also keeping the world informed as the violence unfolds:

Meanwhile, [talk](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2011/03/03/AR2011030305420.html?hpid=topnews) of US
military intervention in Libya has received little enthusiasm from neither
Libyan nor American tweeps.

Past experiences of Bosnia and Rwanda have come back to haunt the
international community as it faces a major test in averting a humanitarian
catastrophe in Libya.

Whilst many are indeed skeptical of American and British intervention in a
strategic Arab state, given historic antagonism, the world must decide whether
allowing thousands to perish is a necessary sacrifice to free Libya from a
ruthless dictator.
