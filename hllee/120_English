Wednesday, November 21 was a horrendous day when Taliban attacked
_[Imambargahs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussainia),_ Muharram mourning
processions, and law enforcement agencies in
[Karachi](http://tribune.com.pk/story/469236/3-killed-4-injured-in-karachi-
rickshaw-blast-near-imambargah/),
[Rawalpindi](http://tribune.com.pk/story/469387/blast-reported-in-mourning-
procession-in-rawalpindi-live-updates/), and
[Quetta](http://tribune.com.pk/story/469190/explosion-heard-in-quetta-express-
news/). _In total_ , 20 people lost their lives and more 43 people got
injured.

Taliban spokesperson Ehsan Ullah Ehsan bluntly [accepted the
responsibility](http://tribune.com.pk/story/469638/pakistani-taliban-claim-
attacks-on-shias-in-karachi-rawalpindi/) for the sectarian attacks on Shia
Muslims, and vowed that more attacks of such magnitude will continue to take
place in future.

#### **Bomb Blast in Karachi**

Two bombs exploded consecutively near an Imambargah in the area of Orangi
town. The bomb was planted inside a rickshaw. Mourning processions were not
taking place at the time of the blast. Security forces swiftly surrounded the
area, pushing the crowd and media people out of danger. Suddenly, a second
blast erupted. Major causalities were not reported.

On 18th November, a bomb blast exploded in front of an Imambargah in the
locality of Abbass Town killing 2 people and left 15 injured.

#### **Bomb Blast in Quetta**

This attacked was explicitly targeted on the law enforcement agencies. A 15kg
bomb was planted on a motorcycle near the main gate of the district jail. 7
people were killed including 3 personnels from the Frontier Constabulary (FC).
More than 16 people got injured.

#### **Bomb Blast in Rawalpindi**

A suicide bomber – [probably 17 or 18 years of
age](http://tribune.com.pk/story/469993/procession-attack-rawalpindi-blast-
death-toll-rises-to-17/) – exploded himself in between a mourning procession
in Dhok Sayidan area. The technique was similar to that used in Karachi. Two
bombs exploded one after the other with a forty minute gap in between. This
was the most sanguine act of all, [killing 23 mourners that included 8
children](http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-76566-Toll-in-Rawalpindi-blast-
rises-to-23).

#### Reactions

Human Rights Watch [vocally condemned](http://dawn.com/2012/11/21/hrw-urges-
govt-to-protect-shias-from-attacks-during-muharram/) the terrorists acts
against Shia Muslims in Pakistan:

> “Pakistani authorities need to address the severe danger faced by the Shia
> population with all necessary security measures. They can start by arresting
> extremist group members responsible for past attacks.”

Twitter users and netizens condemned these acts of terrorism.

Marvi Sirmed tweets:

Many noted the fact that acts of terrorism perpetrated against Shia Muslims
didn't get the same level of attention compared to Israel's attacks on Gaza
Strip (See [Globalvoices
report](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/11/24/pakistan-stands-with-
palestine/))

Ghaffar Hussain tweets:

In his [blog post](http://criticalppp.com/archives/231236), Abdul Nishapuri
asks a very pertinent question:

> “Why are 6000 Shia children killed in Pakistan less worthy than a few dozen
