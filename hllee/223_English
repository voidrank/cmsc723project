Continuing with Global Voices’ coverage of the ongoing #Feb14 protests in
Bahrain, we have compiled a number of videos covering today's
[developments](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/15/bahrain-day-of-wrath-
no-2/).

Many of Bahrain's protesters have turned to YouTube, Bambuser and Facebook to
upload videos from the day's events across the capital Manama and neighbouring
villages. A number of protester Bambuser accounts have been blocked by the
authorities within the country including
@[Nabeelrajab](http://bambuser.com/channel/nabeel-rajab) and
@[alaali](http://bambuser.com/channel/alaali)‘s accounts.

The day's events started at Salmaniya Medical Center, Bahrain's largest
hospital in Manama, where some thousands of people waited to start the funeral
procession for 27 year old Ali Mushaima to bury him in his hometown in Daih.
Unfortunately, riot police forces fired tear gas and bird shotgun fire at
mourners, later leading to the death of Fadhel Al-Matrook.

After the 3pm news, national television broadcast the first speech by His
Majesty King Hamad after protests began giving his condolences to the families
of the killed and ordering an investigative committee headed by Vice Prime
Minister Jawad Al-Orrayedh to look into the killings and find those
responsible. He also emphasized on the freedom of protest within laws and
asked the Parliament to seek the demands of the people and create legislation.
He concluded his speech praying to Allah to keep Bahrain safe from harm and
find reconciliation.
