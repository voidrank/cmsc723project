> …not to forget the Nepal territory because Nepal territory is also a part of
> India…

A recent remark by a moderator of an Indian TV channel had outraged many
Nepalis who vented their reactions on different social networking sites. In a
movie review show [ETC Bollywood Business](http://www.etc.in/bollywood-
business/) anchor and movie analyst Komal Nahta made a statement that Nepal is
also part of India while explaining the box office collection for the
blockbuster Bollywood movie DON 2.

The video on YouTube posted below also follows a clarification statement by
[ETC networks](http://www.etc.in/ "ETC Networks") on the statement made by Mr.
Nahta:

It became a much talked issue on social networks this week and has once again
fuelled debate on Nepal-India relations.

As matters got intense online, especially on Twitter mentioning Komal Nahta
([@KomalNahta](http://twitter.com/KomalNahta "Komal Nahta")) while discussing
his statement, he had to tweet a [clarification
article](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/f0osap. "Clarification Article") and
also had to write a [convincing blog post](http://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-
news/in-film-biz-parlance-nepal-is-a-territory-of-india/ "Blog Post from Komal
Nahta") by holding his same values.

It was surprising that Komal did not regret his statement on his [blog
post](http://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/in-film-biz-parlance-nepal-is-a-
territory-of-india/ "Blog Post from Komal Nahta"). Rather to justify his
point, he further claimed those who made such statements were just irate
citizens and hardly knew about his business point. He further added:

> Probably, most of the Nepali citizens who created a controversy where none
> existed, weren’t even aware that Nepal is, in fact, counted as part of India
> for the express purpose of counting the domestic shares of Bollywood films.

His attitude in responding to others’
[tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/KomalNahta/status/152459485779202048
"Responding Tweet from Komal natha") was also questionable.

It was not just blog posts and website articles on the issues; some YouTube
videos were also made against the reporter’s statement. Watch [this
episode](http://youtu.be/xI9BeNHH2_g) on the topic:

This is not the first time that such a controversy has aroused Nepalis to
speak against it. In 1998, Madhuri Dixit, popular Bollywood actor had to
apologise when she said that Nepal was once a part of India. Again in 2000,
Hrithik Roshan, another Bollywood actor had to clarify that he had never
stated that he hated Nepal and its people.

The Hrithik and Madhuri's case was also [covered by BBC News
](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1088100.stm "Nepal India
Controversy on BBC")saying, “Movie theatres across Nepal have suspended
screening Indian films after an alleged anti-Nepal slur by a Bollywood star.”

Recently in a comedy show [Stephen Colbert made fun of Nepali
identity](http://nepaliblogger.com/articles/nepal-is-not-honoring-mr-stephen-
colbert/1966/ "Nepal is not Honouring Stephen Colbert") and culture, which had
aroused similar discussions on social media.

I commented in [my own blog post](http://nepaliblogger.com/articles/be-it-
industry-norm-or-whatever-nepal-is-not-territory-of-india/4123/):

> My view on the topic is that be it film business calculations or industry
> norm or whatever, it is indeed a blasphemous error. If it’s industry norms,
> the reporter should have mentioned that clearly in his show.
