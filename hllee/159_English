The people of multi-ethnic Macedonia are organizing a March for Peace this
Saturday as an expression of concern that the recent hate crimes are a
harbinger of civil war.

The march is scheduled for Saturday, March 17, 2012, at 2pm in Skopje City
Park, and the word is being spread via [this Facebook
event](http://www.facebook.com/events/203359516435235/) [mk], [Tweetvite
event](http://tweetvite.com/event/zmyv) [mk], the Twitter account [Zaedno za
mir](https://twitter.com/#!/zaedno_za_mir) (Together for Peace) and the
hashtags [#PEACEmk, #ZaednoZaMir, #zzm or
#marshnamirot](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23PEACEmk%20OR%20%23ZaednoZaMir%20OR%20%23zzm%20OR%20%23marshnamirot).

[The initiative](http://www.radiomof.mk/marsh-za-mir-marsh-per-paqe/) [mk] is
organized by activists and around 50 civil society organizations, with the
involvement of artists and media personalities from all local ethnic groups
who do not want to see a reprise of [the 2001
conflict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Macedonia_conflict) (also known as
the [“second halftime”](http://www.plusinfo.mk/mislenje/425/Vtoro-poluvreme-
za-idioti) [mk] concept). They say:

>  FOR Friendship!  
>  FOR Society without violence!  
>  Without prejudice and manipulation!  
>  We welcome all who strive towards the reduction of the tensions and raising
> of the awareness of living together!  
>  This is an issue of civic and human consciousness.  
>  Let’s plant the seed of love.  
>  We want it and we can do it!

The march comes as a reaction to [a series of violent inter-ethnic
developments](http://tolerance-mk.blogspot.com/2012/03/who-wants-war-in-
macedonia.html), including slow [[mk](http://diversitymedia.mk/index.php/141),
[sq](http://diversitymedia.mk/index.php/142)] and controversial reactions by
the authorities to the murder in Gostivar after/during an argument over
parking space on February 28, the after-funeral protests and the stoning of
select shops, followed by a series of violent incidents involving
“spontaneous” “revenge” attacks – beatings of the passersby on the streets of
several Macedonian cities and in the public transport in Skopje, leaving
dozens of people with serious injuries.

All this was accompanied by biased media coverage, up to the level of open
[hate speech](http://kvadraturanakrugot.crnaovca.mk/2012/03/14/tekstot-na-
krivichnata-prijava-protiv-dragan-pavlovikj-latas/) [mk] in most of the
ethnically/linguistically-divided commercial media that
[remain](http://en.rsf.org/macedonia-disastrous-summer-for-
macedonian-17-08-2011,40797.html)
[operational](http://www.osce.org/fom/80636). The period of the deterioration
of the security situation in Macedonia [started in late
January](http://www.balkanalysis.com/macedonia/2012/02/13/after-macedonias-
islamist-protest-investigators-search-for-significance-amidst-confusing-array-
of-motives-and-clues/), and was preceded by long-term efforts of nationalist
mobilization instigated by the ruling ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian
parties within their “own” ethnic groups, and judicial “tradition” of impunity
or [leniency](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/09/07/macedonia-no-jail-
time-for-participants-in-violent-inter-ethnic-incident/) towards perpetrators
of _de facto_ [hate crimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime). (The
concept of hate crime is not present as such within the Macedonian legal
system, even though instigating ethnic or racial hatred is a felony.)
