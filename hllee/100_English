On February 9, 2013, some 200 armed Filipinos belonging to the so-called Royal
Sulu Army occupied parts of Lahad Datu in
[Sabah](http://www.quezon.ph/2013/03/01/north-borneo-sabah-an-annotated-
timeline-1640s-present/) (North Borneo) and declared ownership of the whole
territory in the name of the Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III.

Sabah has been [part](http://www.malaysia-
chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=66961:12-reasons-why-
philippines-cant-claim-sabah&Itemid=2) of the Malaysian Federation since 1963.
But the Sulu Sultanate, which is located in southern Philippines, has
continued to assert its historical and proprietary claims over the territory.
Moreover, the Philippines has yet to officially drop its
[claim](http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/newsroom/dfa-releases/7572-q-a-a-on-
the-lahad-datu-situation) that Sabah is part of its territory.

For three weeks, the Malaysian government asked the armed Filipinos in Lahad
Datu to surrender. But finally on March 5, the military
[attacked](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/09/malaysians-support-army-
offensive-against-sabah-terrorists/) the group and ended the occupation. The
clash and subsequent military operations reportedly led to the killing of more
than 60 individuals, including 8 members of the Malaysian police.

The Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quick to brand the armed
Filipinos as
[terrorists](http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/home?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_Yt06&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-3&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=5&_101_INSTANCE_Yt06_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_Yt06_urlTitle=press-

pada-4-mac-2013&_101_INSTANCE_Yt06_type=content&redirect=%2Fweb%2Fguest%2Fhome).
The Philippine government – which is currently finalizing a peace agreement
with Muslim separatists in the southern part of the country – also condemned
the occupation. President Benigno S. Aquino III accused “persons of interest”
associated with his predecessor’s administration of
[“conspiring”](http://www.gov.ph/2013/03/04/statement-of-president-aquino-on-
the-events-in-sabah-march-4-2013-english/) to spark trouble in Sabah:

> We are aware that there are those who conspired to bring us to this
> situation — a situation that has no immediate solutions. Some of their
> identities are clear to us, while others continue to skulk in the shadows.  
>  To the people who are behind this, even now, I tell you: you will not
> succeed. All those who have wronged our country will be held accountable.

Interestingly, the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has yet to dismiss the
theory that Malaysian opposition politicians have
[conspired](http://www.rappler.com/nation/23032-malaysia-has-own-conspiracy-
theory) with the Sulu Sultan in order to destabilize the country and bring
down the ruling coalition ahead of this year’s general elections.

**Humanitarian Crisis**

The Lahad Datu standoff also sparked a humanitarian crisis after scores of
Sabah residents with Filipino ancestry were
[arrested](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/223705) and more than 1,500
migrant Filipinos sought [refuge](http://www.gov.ph/2013/03/12/office-of-the-
presidential-spokesperson-basulta-situationer-as-of-march-12-2013/) in the
Philippines. There are also allegations of human rights abuses committed by
the Malaysian security forces, a claim that was strongly
[denied](http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/pr2012/-/asset_publisher/X9Nx/content/press-
release:-the-government-of-malaysia-strongly-rejects-allegations-of-human-
rights-abuses-in-sabah-english-version-only?redirect=%2Fweb%2Fguest%2Fpr2012)
by the Kuala Lumpur government. The Sabah Coalition of Human Rights
Organisations raised additional concerns about the
[impact](http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/223767) of the military operation on
Sabah’s residents:

> Militarisation and the presence of security forces have created many
> roadblocks restricting the movements of the indigenous peoples in their
> foraging for food, harvesting, hunting and fishing.  
>  The limitations on travel will result on food shortages for them.

Indeed, the Sabah question is likely to pose problems for both Malaysia and
the Philippines for the foreseeable future. For instance, Carol Araullo of the
left-leaning Bayan coalition
[accuses](http://bulatlat.com/main/2013/03/12/cacique-diplomacy/) Aquino of
abandoning the Philippines’ claims over the territory:

> Many are beginning to surmise that the Aquino regime is not all convinced
> that the Sabah claim has [merit](http://bulatlat.com/main/2013/03/06/on-the-
> question-of-philippine-sovereignty-over-sabah/) and his description of it as
> a “hopeless cause” is not just a slip of the tongue indicating “ignorance or
> incompetence” as Sultan Jamalul Kiram III suspects, but his regime’s point
> of view and even policy on the matter.

R Kengadharan raises these
[questions](http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/223222) for the Malaysian
government:

> How did the armed intruders enter our shores without the knowledge of our
> navy?  
>  What has happened to our domestic and regional intelligence services?  
>  Who has been providing the self-proclaimed sultan of Sulu arms?  
>  Who is providing guerrilla training for the armed intruders in Sulu?

To avert a similar crisis in the future, perhaps the time has come for the
leaders of Malaysia and the Philippines to settle once and for all the Sabah
issue.
