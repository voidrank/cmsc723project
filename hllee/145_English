On June 16, Egyptian were [called to
vote](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/17/egyptians-vote-second-
presidential-runoff) on the second round of the presidential elections amidst
attempts by the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces (SCAF) to keep a tight
rein on the political stage. With the [Parliament
dissolved](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/45324/Egypt/0/Dissolution-
of-parliament-unconstitutional,-ElKata.aspx), the [New Constitutional
Declaration](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/45376/Egypt/Politics-/Revised-
constitutional-chart-stirs-up-controversy.aspx) giving almost all powers
toSCAF, the choice between Muslim Brotherhood's candidate Mohamed Morsi and
the regime's former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq gets even more painful.

Indeed, [both candidates seem to be
unwanted](http://www.arabist.net/blog/2012/6/17/the-sadness-of-egypts-
presidential-election.html), as one of them symbolizes the remnants of ousted
president Hosni Mubarak's era, and the second one is seen as a traitor to the
revolution.

Following are some photographs of that historical day of elections posted by
netizens on social networking sites:
