In December 2011, at the end of a 7-month strike by disgruntled oil workers,
deadly riots in the town of
[Zhanaozen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhanaozen) near the Caspian Sea
shocked the formerly peaceful nation of Kazakhstan. The violent government
response to the riots and the [subsequent
trials](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18323805) of protesters and
police involved drew [considerable
criticism](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65888) from [international
observers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18816018), who felt the
government was out to quash all opposition and clear itself of the blame.

Now a [final trial](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65792) is underway to judge
the involvement of Vladimir Kozlov, leader of the unregistered opposition
party Alga, who is accused of inciting the riots together with two other
strike leaders.

(Global Voices Online already
[reported](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/08/22/kazakhstan-trial-of-
opposition-leaders-draws-pussy-riot-comparisons/) about the trial that some
Kazakhstani netizens had described as “a [Pussy
Riot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot) of our own”.)

Kozlov's connection to [Mukhtar
Ablyazov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhtar_Ablyazov) is a major part of
the accusation. Mukhtar Ablyazov is a former rival of President Nursultan
Nazarbayev. He is currently hiding in Europe and is [wanted by Kazakh and
British authorities](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65017). Although
[narratives
differ](http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav112409.shtml),
Kazakhstani authorities allege that Ablyazov pocketed 550 million US dollars
when serving as head of the nation's largest bank, an accusation that made the
man a universally despised figure in Kazakhstan.

Supporters of political oppositionist Vladimir Kozlov await a verdict in a
courtroom in Aktau, western Kazakhstan. (Screen capture from a video uploaded

**Reactions at home and abroad**

While Western NGO's and journalists [condemn the
trial](http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/second-monitoring-report-documents-
further-violations-fair-trial-kozlov-case) of opposition leader Kozlov as
unfair, Kazakhstan's bloggers have little sympathy for the man. Besides the
direct supporters of Kozlov and his party, most other voices appear to back
the government-initiated trial and expect Kozlov to be punished.

More importantly, many netizens condemn what they see as attempts by Western
governments and organizations to interfere in Kazakhstan's internal affairs by
criticizing the trial.

For instance, popular Kazakhstani blogger Yaroslav Krasiyenko (aka
MontKristov) writes in an article entitled ‘[Dr. Freedom House, who are you to
[word omitted] lecture me?](http://yvision.kz/post/253359)‘ [ru], that one of
the trial's strongest critics, the NGO [Freedom
House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House), has discredited itself by
its dependence on funding coming from the U.S. government:

> “Freedom House — неправительственная организация со штаб-квартирой в
> Вашингтоне (США). Её бюджет на 66-80 % посредством грантов финансируется
> правительством США.” По художественной силе этот абзац близок к фразе
> “Матильда – непродажная девушка, живущая за счёт богатых мужиков”.

> “Freedom House is a non-governmental organization with headquarters in
> Washington, DC (USA). Sixty-six to 88 percent of its budget is made up by
> grants from the U.S. government.” Written in artful prose, the meaning of
> this paragraph lies close to the phrase “Matilda, an incorruptible girl
> living at the expense of the rich men”.

After listing a series of alleged human rights violations committed by the
U.S. government, the blogger concludes that Washington's actions diverge
significantly from its human rights rhetoric. Therefore, he announces, the
U.S. has no right to judge the way Kazakhstan manages its internal affairs.

Blogger [Anara](http://bazanara.yvision.kz/) (Bazanara), who is attending the
controversial trial, [writes](http://bazanara.yvision.kz/post/287999) [ru]
critically about the foreign observers:

> О тех иностранных, промолчу. Кто пожелает, могу предоставить фото спящего
> иностранного журналиста и российского блоггера Щелокова, говорящего по
> мобильному телефону в зале суда. А знаете для чего они это делают? Скандал
> им нужен, любой.

> I will remain silent about those foreigners. If anyone is interested, I can
> provide photos capturing a sleeping foreign journalist and Russian blogger
> Schelokov talking on his cell phone in the courtroom. Do you know why they
> [attend the trial]? They need a scandal, any scandal.

Many Kazakhstanis are frustrated by Westerners who they feel are quick to
point out problems in the oil-rich Central Asian nation, while refusing to
take note of similar issues in their own countries.

As a response to a Google Plus post entitled ‘[Is Kazakhstan the new
Uzbekistan?](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113700766531509914748/posts/HqiiTm88JmM)‘,
Twitter user Kairat
[replies](https://twitter.com/kairat/statuses/246628413090181120) with a quote
from the Bible:

> In another person's eye one can notice a mote, but in one's own – cannot see
> a log.

Kazakhstanis are proud of the achievements of their young nation, and feel
they are capable of handling their domestic problems without the interference
of patronizing outsiders. It appears that the generally politically apathetic
citizens of Kazakhstan want to return to the peaceful status quo that ruled
the country prior to the Zhanaozen riots, while seeing the political
opposition's struggle for human rights and an uncorrupted leadership as
dangerous and destabilizing.
