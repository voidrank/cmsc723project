If you are in Cyprus, your life's savings hangs in the balance, as the
government deliberates a controversial [€10 billion
](http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/03/cyprus-bail-
out?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/unfair_short_sighted_and_self_defeating)bailout [agreement
reached with the
Eurogroup](http://eurozone.europa.eu/newsroom/news/2013/03/eg-statement-
cyprus-16-03-13/) that puts the country's saving deposits down as collateral.

The unprecedented bailout measure threatens to snatch [€5.8
billion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/18/cyprus-closes-banks-
bailout-package) from all savers in the country. Cypriots have had no access
to their bank accounts ever since the government entered into the agreement on
Saturday, March 16, 2013 and put all accounts on lockdown to avoid a [bank
run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run) or a series of account
withdrawals.

Leading up to the shock announcement, concern and uncertainity was abound
among Twitter users in Cyprus:

> [‏@madamitsa](https://twitter.com/madamitsa/status/312724227503562754):
> #Eurogroup go home, you're drunk.

> [@ktrnstefanou](https://twitter.com/ktrnstefanou/status/312853498683338752):
> Και έψαχνα στο λεξικό να βρω τι είναι εκείνο το watertight που περιείχε η

> mentioned in [Christine]
> [Lagarde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde)‘s announcement.
> Probably it means “left out in the cold [water]”

The most prominent feeling was the uncertainty on whether the night would end
with a successful agreement or not:

>
> [‏@nchrysoloras](https://twitter.com/nchrysoloras/status/312719653136912385):
> Official 1: “We don't yet have a DSA, but I believe we will by tonight”
> Official 2: “There is progress. Let's see”. #Cyprus #Eurogroup

At 2:00-3:00 a.m. in the morning, there were references about a
“[haircut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haircut_\(finance\))” on bank deposits
to use that as collateral for the bailout, and rumors that President [Nicos
Anastasiades ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicos_Anastasiades)had threatened
to abandon all negotiations. While those were happening, Cyprus was in a
carnival mood – the shock would come the next day:

>
> [‏@ZENONZINDILIS](https://twitter.com/ZENONZINDILIS/status/312673988277071873):
> Τι έκαναν οι Κύπριοι το βράδυ που παιζόταν το μέλλον τους #eurogroup;
> Ετοιμαζόντουσαν για αποκριάτικο γλέντι και γενικώς “δεν φακκούσαν πένα”

>
> [@ZENONZINDILIS](https://twitter.com/ZENONZINDILIS/status/312673988277071873):
> What were the Cypriots doing the night their future was on stake? #eurogroup
> They were preparing for carnival fun and generally “they didn't give a fuck”
> [idiom in Cypriot Greek]

The next day's reactions varied from anger and indignation to stoic
acceptance. In social media platforms and mainstream media, the debate on
whether the Parliament must approve the haircut plan or not remains and both
sides have their own strong arguments; however, the true nature of people's
uncertainty is that nobody knows the real consequences of each choice:

Apart from the government's point of view and many citizens’ objection to
Eurogroup's presumed blackmail, there is also a third approach in Cyprus,
summarized in a post by blogger Strovoliotis, who supports the memorandum
approval by Parliament from an oppositional point of view:

> [@Strovoliotis](https://twitter.com/Strovoliotis/status/313018453026025472):
> Σας τα ‘λεγα εγώ, αλλά δεν έχει πλέον καμιά σημασία. Το κλειδί: Ψυχραιμία!

> I was saying all this from the very beginning, but now it doesn't even

As expected, the anti-Eurogroup statements that “no deposits’ haircut is going
to happen” by President Anastasiades and Minister of Finance, [Michael
Sarris,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sarris) were especially popular
around the Cypriot and Greek-speaking web in general.

  

As the Monday parliamentary vote process was approaching, there were gradually
more and more arguments that the unprecedented Eurozone's ministers’ decision
is bad for the European Union. Many Cypriot social media users shared this
article from the[ Economist](http://econ.st/Yijtsv):

On Tuesday, March 19, the government's request to suspend all bank operations
is being interpreted as an effort to emphasize the rigid nature of the Cypriot
economy. Α possible bank run (domino of bank withdrawals) in Spain and other
countries is already being considered a probable outcome:

However, some Europeans didn't remain indifferent to the solidarity calls:

>
> @[Igualitarista](https://twitter.com/Igualitarista/status/313593095495241728):
> Spaniards using hashtag [~~#~~
> somosChipre](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23somosChipre&src=hash) (we are
> Cyprus) out of solidarity & to oppose locking out depositors from their
> accounts.

Finally, the parliamentary vote process was postponed; thus, it's possible
that banks will remain closed for the rest of the week:

Uncertainty now reigns over the bank system itself and the European Union's
existence.
