Since Thursday December 16th, the day Alassane Ouattara called for his
partisans to march onto the national television RTI building, scenes of civil
war have taken place in Côte d'Ivoire. According to the
[UN](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gf8hRWXy_C11VWoYeK21VltagyHA?docId=CNG.0ac591973116339f864c85b72feeb2cb.3d1),
50 people died and 200 were wounded these last days. Although images of
violences are rare in the traditional media because of of the censorship of
dissident medias in Abidjan, some videos were shared on the Internet. The
following video shows demonstrators being attacked by militaries during which
at least one person was killed.

According to local eye-witnesses, the next video shows Ouattara's partisans on
their way to the Hôtel du Golf last Thursday, in the Riviera district of
Abidjan.

Another Internet user posted [series](http://www.twitvid.com/videos/bzkdjc) of
videos where we can see a person dying after he was beaten up by armed forces.

This weekend the anti-UN and anti-Sarkozy rhetoric reached a new high when
Gbagbo's Government asked for foreign forces to leave the country.

Saturday December 18h in Yopougon, the Minister of Youth, and chief of
Gbagbo's Forces of Defense and Security (FDS) young Militiamen, Charles Blé
Goudé, adressed the crowd with a radical speech against foreign forces,
inviting partisans to get ready to sacrifice their lives for the cause :

> “Sarkozy et l'ONU préparent un génocide en Côte d'Ivoire”

Sarkozy and the UN are preparing a genocide in Côte d'Ivoire

> “L'ONU a un mandat souterrain, ils veulent enlever Gbagbo du pouvoir (…)
> Vous allez devoir en tuer beaucoup. “

“The UN has an unspoken motive, they want to remove Gbagbo from power (…) You
may have to kill many of us.”

The meeting was broadcasted on the Ivorian Radio Television (RTI), the
national TV channel, and the commentator says at the end :

> “Les patriotes sont prêts à faire le sacrifice ultime”

“Patriots are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.”

The situation in Abidjan is getting worse. R., an Ivorian Internet user
interviewed via instant messaging, explains under the cover of anonymity :

> “Des vidéos des violences existent, mais sur twitter on ne peut pas en
> parler parce que les menaces sont de plus en plus directes”

“Videos of violences exist, but on Twitter we can't talk about it anymore
because threats are becoming more personal”

Many ivorian Internet users who were really active on the hashtag
[#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search/civ2010) don't tweet anymore. Some are
[threatened ](http://twitter.com/#!/sylvere18/status/16092007936040960):

> “@[Sanders225](http://twitter.com/Sanders225) jespère que vous qui tweetez a
> partir de votre pc vous avez installé des logiciels pour cacher votre ip
> [#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23civ2010 "#civ2010")“

” [@Sanders225](http://twitter.com/#!/Sanders225) To those who tweet from
their computers I hope you have installed softwares to hide your IP adress
[#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search/civ2010)“

R. also denounces the tattling atmosphere that prevails now in the country
against those who dare share pieces of information with the rest of the world
:

> “on est revenu à l'ere de la gestapo avec exécutions publiques”

“We are back to the Gestapo era with public sentencing”

Many Internet users mention the presence of Death Squads who don't hesitate to
act after the curfew in districts where Ouattara's partisans live. Like
[@Sanders225](<a href=) explains:

> “Every single day, innocent people are killed during night time curfew in
> Ivory Cost. Death squads are back.
> [#help](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23help
> "#help")[#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23civ2010 "#civ2010")“

A rumor widely spread and relayed in Abidjan and on Twitter, reports the
presence of Liberian mercenaries hired to back up Gbagbo's FDS:
[@Kanateecs](http://twitter.com/#!/Kanateecs) [informs
](http://twitter.com/#!/Kanateecs/status/16544057610211328)that night
exactions are perpetrated by those mercenaries :

> “Abobo, koumassi, anyama yopougon, ces communes ou les gens ne dorment plus
> de peur d'etre tuer dans leur sommeil par les liberiens
> [#civ2010](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23civ2010 "#civ2010")“

“Abobo, koumassi, anyama yopougon, those districts where people don't sleep
anymore fearing to be killed like animals by Liberian milicia
http://twitter.com/#!/search/civ2010″
