[Tarek Amr](https://globalvoicesonline.org/author/tarek-amr/), a member of
Global Voices’ Egypt team, has been offline since January 26, when the
government [forced most ISPs](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/28/egypt-
an-internet-blackhole/) to close shop.  
Today, with the [Internet back up](http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/02/egypt-
returns-to-the-internet.shtml), he [shares his
story](http://notgr33ndata.blogspot.com/2011/02/mubaraks-roller-coaster.html):

> I didn't participate in the first day of the revolution. I was a bit scared,
> a bit not convinced that it will change anything, and also I prefer to
> follow such events on twitter and facebook instead of participating in them.

After the Internet was turned off, however, Tarek decided to venture out. He
explains:

> Two days later, the government switched off the mobile phones, the internet,
> blackberry, and all other means of communication. They thought that they
> might prevent people from communicating and arranging for further
> demonstrations. But the truth is that such [information
> blackout](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/01/28/egypt-an-internet-
> blackhole/) made me – as well as thousands of other people – eager more to
> get down to the streets and participate in the “Friday of Anger”.

Tarek shares his story from Friday, January 28, the “Day of Anger”:

> Again, the police brutality didn't stop. Rubber bullets, tear bomb, and even
> lethal bullets were used in different places in Egypt. They were doing their
> best to prevent the protesters from crossing the bridges and going to Tahrir
> square. We tried different bridges in different areas, but we faced the same
> resistance from the police, till a curfew was announced and I preferred to
> go back to home, along with many others.

He shares a sentiment echoed by many Egyptians–the feeling of waiting:

> In the following three days, all security forces and policemen dissipated
> from the streets. Protesters stayed in Tahrir Square calling for a million-
> persons protest/march on Tuesday. People at homes lived in a state of
> terror, where they carried sticks and knives every night and spent their
> nights in the streets protecting their homes and businesses. People also
> cleaned the streets by themselves, and protected some governmental and
> national buildings. During those three days, every visit you pay to Tahrir
> Square makes you believe that Mubarak should be now packing his stuff to
> leave the presidential palace, then a single glance on the national TV makes
> you believe he is getting himself ready for thirty more years inside the
> palace.

Tarek then expresses the uncertainty he is left with after days of revolt in
his native Cairo:

> And once more, I experienced Mubarak's roller coaster. I was happy after his
> speech. Although he didn't resign, but he promised not to run in the
> following presidential elections and promised to let the parliament fix the
> parts of the constitution that limit the presidential candidates to the
> members of the NDP or the ones approved by the party only. But after a
> while, I found myself wondering, isn't this just another manoeuvre by the
> president…

He concludes:

> I'm still confused. I really can't tell if the revolvers have achieved at
> least a significant part of their demands, or the revolution was murdered. I
> am not the only one confused here, many protesters are confused too. Some
> are saying that they have to stay and calling for another demonstration next
> Friday, and some others are calling people to get back to their homes end
> those protests altogether. Nothing is sure yet, but I am just sure of one
> single thing, Egypt has changed. I still remember that poor lady I met in
> Tahrir who said something that summed the whole thing in few simple words.
> She told me, “A couple of days ago I was so scared of every single police
> soldier, and today I am here protesting against the head of the state”.
