Australia’s parliament is currently debating a private members bill about
same-sex marriage. (Private members bills are proposed laws that are not
introduced by the government. Individual parliamentarians may free to vote
according to their conscience depending on their party’s policy on the issue.)

This one is not to change the law, merely to consult with the public about the
issue:

The ALP government does not support legalisation but is under pressure to
change its stance:

> Labor agreed at its last national conference in 2009 not to support gay
> marriage, and Prime Minister Julia Gillard has ruled out a conscience vote
> on the issue.
>
> But Labor will now support a Greens motion which calls for all MPs to speak
> to their constituents about gay marriage.  
>  [Labor backs talks on gay
> marriage](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/16/3067694.htm)

Many in the Oz blogosphere have strong views. _The Conscience Vote_ ,
“Politics for the human’, examines the issue in detail, arguing for its
importance and urgency:

> As long as the government enshrines this discrimination, the tireless work
> of those who give their time, money and – sometimes, horribly – their lives
> to build trust, rapport and respect between all Australians regardless of
> their sexuality will continue to be undermined.  
>  [Same-sex marriage – yes, it’s that
> important](http://consciencevote.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/same-sex-marriage-
> important/)

Iain Hall gives his thoughts from his _Sandpit_ :

> If the likes of Adam Brandt are so sure that the community supports their
> position why are they not advocating that this be put to a popular vote at a
> referendum? Well it probably has something to do with the fact that although
> a lot of people support the right for anyone to fuck any other consenting
> adult and for anyone to set up whatever sort of household they please they
> are actually quite content with the definition of marriage in the current
> marriage act and they see no reason to change it.  
>  [The claim that the push for “Gay” marriage is all about “love” is just
> utter bollocks ](http://iainhall.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/the-claim-that-
> the-push-for-gay-marriage-is-all-about-love-is-just-utter-bollocks/)

In a post for _Menzies House_ , a ‘community for conservative, centre-right
and libertarian thinkers and activists’, Mark Sharma attacks Greens leader Bob
Brown:

> …the Greens are relentlessly bringing up gay marriage and attacking
> Australian families. Why is Senator Brown doing all this? The only
> assumption one can make is that the Greens want to weaken our economy with a
> carbon tax and destroy our social fabric with gay marriage. A weakened
> nation would serve as a perfect launch pad for communism.

At _Work, Love & Play_, ‘discussion of the politics and culture of same-sex
parented families’, Jennifer Power’s discussion starts with opinion polling:

> Poll after poll shows a majority of the Australian public supports gay
> marriage. However, a recent Roy Morgan poll indicates that opinions on
> homosexuality vary quite dramatically across the country. Not surprisingly,
> inner-city electorates hold the most positive attitudes toward
> homosexuality, while negative attitudes tend to be congregated in rural
> areas…

> not-to-be.html )

At _STRONG SILENT TYPES—STUFF ABOUT MEN_ , Ultimo167 also sees a particular
problem in rural electorates:

> The current gay marriage debate hints at why homophobia blazes afresh in the
> bush…  
>  ..life can be tough for any fag living outside of big city Australia…  
>  The resistance by our two major political parties to support gay marriage
> is driven, almost exclusively by number counting in those homophobic
> electorates ‘out there’.
>
> .. I say, how can it be that pandering to bigotry should ever trump
> defending human rights?

> Australia](http://ultimo167.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/patterns-of-gay-hatred-
> across-australia/)

_All Australian_ ’s Philip Maguire makes his viewpoint clear in the opening
sentence:

> The debate over the non-entity of gay marriage is with us again.

He views marriage as a heterosexual union for the raising of children:

> …the denigration of the reproductive aspects of marriage by gays and others
> has been enormously detrimental. The “me” generation is more concerned with
> the rights of individuals than the collective rights of children to a decent
> home and family life.  
>  [“Marriage” debate is on
> again.](http://maguidhir.blogspot.com/2010/11/marriage-debate-is-on-
> again.html)

At _still life with cat_ , Kerryn Goldsworthy takes up the connection between
marriage and procreation, apparently also raised by parliamentarian Philip
Ruddock:

> So: does Ruddock think that not just gays and lesbians, but no women past
> childbearing age, and nobody of either sex who was born or has been rendered
> infertile, should be allowed to get married? And to take his remark to its
> logical conclusion, does he think that any existing marriage in which either
> partner has become unable to ‘procreate’ should be dissolved?  
>  [This can't be right, can it? Or can
> it?](http://stilllifewithcat.blogspot.com/2010/11/this-cant-be-right-can-it-
> or-can-it.html)

William Kostakis, author of the novel _Loathing Lola,_ has both experience and
strong feelings to draw on, at his self-titled blog:

> If you have two parents, be they opposite genders, or ‘gays’, and they love
> and support you, and they nurture you, then you know what? That’s what
> matters in the end. See, the funny thing is, my two female parents, they
> taught me to respect, and embrace, difference. My male parent taught me to
> hide my money in my new wife’s name so that I can avoid my parental
> obligations.

If change is coming, it is certainly moving slowly. It will be interesting to
find out what the electors tell their representatives. Or will it be a case of
hearing what you believe?
