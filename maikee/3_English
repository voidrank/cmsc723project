[Ján Figeľ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1n_Fige%C4%BE), the Slovak
minister of transport, [said
recently](http://ekonomika.sme.sk/c/5637505/figel-nechce-lacnu-dialnicu-z-
ciny.html) that extremely low prices charged by Chinese road-builders would
not be accepted automatically in Slovakia – because of
[dumping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_%28pricing_policy%29).

A Chinese company whose price was 40 percent lower than the local prices, has
already won an expressway construction contract in Poland, however. In the
Czech Republic, a government official said that “construction of 5 km of
express highway would have strong cultivation effect on the behaviour of other
players on the market.”

Opinions of the Czech and Slovak companies are similar. “The problem is to
avoid their occupation of the job market for our citizens. When our citizens
have no job, what will Slovakia look like?” asked Zsolt Lukáč from the Slovak
Union of Construction Entrepreneurs.

The netizens’ opinions are mixed.

(Figel got a flat in the capital's old city at the time when his Christian-
Democratic Party had a strong position there. After this became known this
year, he made a moral decision to give it up “[for
charity](http://www.sme.sk/c/5581449/figel-da-svoj-byt-na-charitu.html)”
(until now, there have been no further details what it actually means). Even
though this way Figel has survived in his present function of the party's
leader, his party did not nominate its own candidate for the recent elections
of the city mayor.)
