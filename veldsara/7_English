Social media movement [Twestival](http://www.twestival.com/info.html) made its
inaugural [debut](http://www.bt.com.bn/features/2011/03/26/tweeting-cause) in
Brunei on March 24, 2011, which marked an important day in the local social
media scene. The chosen motto was
‘[Tweet.Meet.Eat.Give](http://www.brunei.twestival.com/)‘ in order to raise
money for the Child Development Centre in support of the World Down Syndrome
Day. Another aim of the Twestival is to connect the local Twitter community
offline and give them an opportunity to meet face to face.

The Brunei Twestival event was sponsored by Kitaro Japanese Restaurant and
Swensens Cafe & Restaurant, which agreed to hold a food eating competition in
support of the charity. The proceeds of the event will be used to buy new
equipment and educational toys for the children of the Child Development
Centre.

A pre-Twestival food challenge event was held at
[@KitaroJapanese](https://twitter.com/#!/KitaroJapanese) Restaurant where
contestants had to consume a plate of sushi. One of the top finalists in last
year's Borneo Blogger awards, [BorneoColours](http://borneocolours.com/)
([@marul69](https://twitter.com/#!/marul69)), was very supportive of the
Twestival event and uploaded a video of one of the winners of the [Sumo
Challenge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kw3eZLZThs).

At Swensen's Cafe & Restaurant, the Huge Swensen's Challenge required
participants to eat the infamous ‘Earthquake’ of 8 scoops of ice cream
weighing 3 oz each in a huge bowl topped with whipped cream and other sweet
toppings. Local blogging heroes came to support and participate in the event
like [@ranoadidas](https://twitter.com/#!/ranoadidas),
[@anakbrunei](https://twitter.com/#!/anakbrunei), [Senor Pablo](http://world-
of-pablo.blogspot.com/), [@kurapak](https://twitter.com/#!/kurapak) and
[@maurina](https://twitter.com/#!/maurina) to name a few.

One of the main organisers [@BruneiTweet](https://twitter.com/#!/BruneiTweet)
for [Twestival Brunei 2011](http://www.projekbrunei.com/twestival-
brunei-2011-tweet-meet-eat-give.html) mentioned on his blog the number of
attendants and how much was collected this year.

> Funds were raised from a portion of the proceeds from dinner sales at Kitaro
> Japanese Restaurant Brunei on 22nd March 2011, and from the sale of ice
> cream and kids meals at Swensen's Brunei (from 20th March 2011 to 24th March
> 2011). The tally of funds raised came up to BND$1,573.82 and has gone
> towards the purchase of developmental toys, teaching aids and educational
> equipment for the children who undertake therapy at the Child Development
> Center.

> Close to 500 people attended across both local events, many Twitter friends
> met up for the first time…

A local podcaster [@talkingaloudbru ](https://twitter.com/#!/Talkingaloudbru)
was present at the event and managed to do quick interviews during the [pre-
Twestival event](http://talkingaloud.libsyn.com/ta-pod-45) at
[@KitaroJapanese](https://twitter.com/#!/kitarojapanese) Restaurant. He was
also one of the volunteers promoting the event and he did a ‘[live
