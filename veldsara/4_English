A little less than 17 days to go for the 2012 Olympics and the whole world is
revving up for this sporting bonanza to be hosted by London – for the second
time in their modern day history. For Africa, there are many prospects and for
some countries, these games will be a culmination of years of preparation as
well as renewed rivalries.

Afritorial [gives](http://afritorial.com/africa-at-the-2012-london-olympics/
t) a historical perspective of how African countries have progressed since the
first time they were represented in 1908:

> Africa’s countries are long time members of the Olympic family with the
> continent’s nations participating in the modern Olympiad since 1908, when
> South Africa was the lone sub Saharan team participating in London.
>
> The second participant was Egypt in 1928 in Amsterdam. The level of
> participation changed in 1960 with the onslaught of African countries
> gaining independence from colonialism; Africans participated prior to this
> date, but generally as team members of their respective colonial powers.
> African nations are now successful participants on the world Olympic stage.
>
> Ethiopia, South Africa, Kenya Nigeria and Ghana probably have the best
> chance of winning the most medals at the 2012 Games. Their athletes are
> phenomenal, their Olympic programs run deep and they rule the long and
> middle distance events while countries like Togo are only sending 2 athletes
> to London because they can’t afford to send more even if they qualified.

ECAD Forum [reminds](http://ecadforum.com/blog/kenya-ethiopia-to-lead-africas-
olympic-medal-hunt/) us of old rivalries such as the one between the
Ethiopians and Kenyans in the athletics middle and long distance races:

> Kenya and Ethiopia are set to continue their traditional role as the
> strongest African medal contenders at the Olympics.
>
> While South Africa may be unable to match the men and women from East Africa
> in podium appearances, they are desperate to better a dismal showing in
> Beijing four years ago when 253 athletes delivered just one medal between
> them.
>
> Nigeria are another country who must believe the only way is up after a one
> silver and three bronze return from the 2008 Games and there are bound to be
> surprises from African unknowns preparing under the radar.
>
> Some Africans have gone to the ends of the earth to try and secure places at
> the July 27-August 12 Games with the South African men’s and women’s hockey
> teams and the Angolan basketball side displaying indomitable spirit.

Racial, gender and religious prejudices [are
noted](http://olympicfanatic.com/) by some of the participating countries such
the Arab state of Saudi Arabia which finally allowed its women to participate
in the Games for the first time:

> Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the Modern-Day Olympics, wrote these words
> more than 90 years ago. And yet only this weekend did Saudi Arabia make the
> decision to allow women to compete in the Olympics for the first time.
> (Don’t expect to see any athletes competing in a bathing suit or leotard,
> though.) Qatar, excluded from consideration for 2020, announced it would
> submit another bid for the 2024 Olympics. Yet 2012 will be the first year
> that it also has fielded an Olympic team that includes women.

the first ever double amputee to participate in both the Paralympics and
Olympics ever. And guess what, he’s African:

> Oscar Pistorius is set to be the first double amputee runner at the Olympic
> Games after being picked by South Africa for the 400m at London 2012. The
> 25-year old has also been selected for the 4 x 400m relay squad. “ Today is
> truly one of the proudest days of my life,” said Pistorious, who will also
> compete in the Paralympics. “It is a real honour and I am also pleased that
> years of hard work, determination and sacrifice have all come together.”
