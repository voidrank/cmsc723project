On December 27, 2017, the Argentine NGO [Abuelas de Plaza de
Mayo](https://www.abuelas.org.ar/)
[announced](https://www.infobae.com/politica/2017/12/27/abuelas-de-plaza-de-
mayo-encontro-a-la-nieta-127/) the recovery of granddaughter number 127. The
latest granddaughter to be found is the daughter of María del Carmen Moyano
and Carlos Poblete, militants from the [Montoneros
organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montoneros) who were kidnapped and
have been missing since the last
[dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reorganization_Process)
in Argentina (1976 – 1983).

The digital news outlet [Cosecha Roja](http://cosecharoja.org/nieta127-el-
monopolio-de-las-buenas-noticias/) briefly tells the story of her parents and
the circumstances surrounding their disappearance:

> Con la llegada de la dictadura, los militares allanaron su casa y ella
> [María del Carmen Moyano] se mudó a San Juan, donde conoció a Carlos
> Poblete, un estudiante de Ingeniería 10 años mayor. “La pareja compartió
> militancia en la organizción Montoneros. Luego de seis meses decidieron
> vivir juntos”, contó Estela de Carlotto. Entre abril y mayo de 1977 Carlos y
> María del Carmen fueron secuestrados en Córdoba y trasladados al centro
> clandestino de detención La Perla. Ella ya estaba embarazada.

> With the arrival of the dictatorship, the military raided her house and she
> [María del Carmen Moyano] moved to San Juan, where she met Carlos Poblete,
> an engineering student who was 10 years older than her. “The couple shared
> militancy in the Montoneros organization. After six months they decided to
> live together,” said Estela de Carlotto. Between April and May of 1977
> Carlos and María del Carmen were kidnapped in Córdoba and taken to the
> clandestine detention center La Perla. She was already pregnant.

“Nieta 127″ (Granddaughter 127) was born in captivity between May and June
1977 in the maternity ward of the clandestine detention center of the [Navy
School of Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Petty-
Officers_School_of_Mechanics) (ESMA). After 40 years, her two uncles and seven
aunts celebrate the closure of an important chapter in their family's history;
however, the wound remains open as the parents’ fate is still unknown.

During the dictatorship, an estimated [30,000 people were victims of forced
disappearances](https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/03/24/argentina/1490385910_331028.html)
and their children, in a good portion of the cases, were appropriated by the
State through illegal adoptions and clandestine births. The number is still
contested, but human rights defenders and the foundation _Abuelas de Plaza de
Mayo_ ([Grandmothers of the Plaza de
Mayo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmothers_of_the_Plaza_de_Mayo) — an
organization devoted to the cause of finding the grandchildren of those who
were disappeared –[ claim this number to be
accurate](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21884147).

Adriana, [granddaughter #126](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/80592-abuelas-de-
plaza-de-mayo-presento-a-la-nieta-126), who had been found just days before
attended the press conference. Two of the granddaughter 127's aunts were
present as well. The identity of the granddaughter 127 herself is not yet
known. The details about the family that raised her were not revealed either
in order to protect their privacy. One of the aunts who was filled with
emotion said:

> We are going to tell her to not to worry. We're going to give her all the
> time in the world to process the situation. We searched for her for 40
> years. We love her intensely.

The joy of the moment could not even be overshadowed by the news of the recent
transfer to home confinement of [Miguel
Etchecolaz](http://www.perfil.com/politica/conceden-prision-domiciliaria-a-
miguel-etchecolatz.phtml), the man that was responsible for the kidnapping,
torture, and murder of a group of high school students in what became known as
the [Night of the
pencils](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noche_de_los_L%C3%A1pices).

> Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo confirmed the news. “The aunts of the
> granddaughter, who have been waiting for this meeting for 40 years, were
> present at the press conference” they said. The news surpassed that of the
> home confinement of Etchecolaz…

### “We will not stop counting”

Under the hashtag [#Nieta127,
](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nieta127?src=hash)Twitter was flooded with
expressions of joy, some of them mixed with indignation and disagreement with
the justice given to those responsible. The image shared in many of the tweets
shows writing on the wall of the _Casa por la Identidad_ (the House of
Identity, lead by the _Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo_ ) where the context of the
forced disappearances during the dictatorship is recounted. Inside the text,
they manually keep count of the grandchildren that have been reunited with
their families:
