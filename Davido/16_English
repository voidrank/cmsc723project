In Cancún, there was great deal of expectation towards the Brazilian
delegation. The South American country was regarded by [COP
16](http://www.cc2010.mx/en/index.php) president [Patricia
Espinosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Espinosa) as one of the key
players paving the way of a positive outcome.

Meanwhile, back in Brazil, the new Forestry Code proposal had suddenly made
its way back to the National Congress end of year voting agenda. The blog
_Eco_ [pt], [a daily insider on the COP 16](http://www.climatenetwork.org/eco-
blog) negotiations run by the Climate Action Network (CAN),
[stated](http://www.climatenetwork.org/blog/brazil-reverse) that “Brazil seems
to be its worst enemy” and analyzed the new Forestry Code:

> […] Brazilian House of Representatives is ready to approve a new forest
> [sic] code that will be the most shameful endorsement of anthropogenic
> global warming in recent history. And it seems that some 370 of the 513
> Representatives are ready to approve this leap backwards.  
>  The bill provides amnesty to illegal deforestation and degradation, it
> reduces the preservation area along rivers, and eliminates the need for
> legal reserves for rural properties of a certain size and a discount for
> larger properties.

The proposal had raised concerned discussions months ago (read [Global Voices’
coverage](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/08/12/brazil-new-forestry-code-
the-right-to-deforestation/)), when approved by a Special Committee on
Forestry Law Changes. But it was postponed to 2011 on the request of President
Lula. Two of the new Forestry Code's most controversial aspects are the
granting of deforestation amnesty to farmers, and the permission for state
governments to have different rules of river bank vegetation.

The issue had almost disappeared until December 7, when about 370 federal
representatives supported a request for the new Code to be brought as an
urgent matter into the House's agenda next year. Leaders of 10 political
parties gave their supporting signature, thus committing 364 representatives
from their parties.

Nonetheless, they were unable to approve the request, as Juliana Russar, a
Brazilian Negotiator Tracker from [Global Campaign for Climate
Action](http://adoptanegotiator.org/about-adopt-a-negotiator/) at COP 16
[registered on her blog](http://adoptanegotiator.org/2010/12/08/a-maratona-do-
clima/) [pt]:

P.S.: I'd like to remind you that there has been a fortunately failed attempt
by the “ _ruralistas_ ” [ruralist caucus or ruralist bench] to vote on the
Forestry Code amendments with urgency in Congress, which generated intense
mobilization by civil society in Brasilia and here in Cancún […]

The Brazilian branch of the NGO Greenpeace [soon made
public](http://twitter.com/GreenpeaceBR/status/12594856572493825) [pt] the
list of the new Code supporters through their Twitter profile:

> [GreenpeaceBR](http://twitter.com/GreenpeaceBR): Veja a lista dos 374
> deputados que empunharam a motosserra e colocaram o Código Florestal no rol
> de votações neste ano. <http://bit.ly/eAhH1G>

[GreenpeaceBR](http://twitter.com/GreenpeaceBR): Check the list of 374
representatives who held the chain saw and added the Forestry Code to this
year's voting list. <http://bit.ly/eAhH1G>

Despite [President
Lula](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCQQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLuiz_In%25C3%25A1cio_Lula_da_Silva&rct=j&q=lula&ei=VyAETarsIcP78AbwtrXnAg&usg=AFQjCNH16tF_Jh7pQoCwm3wpTqb4sikuqQ&cad=rja)‘s
decision, congressman Cândido Vaccarezza, leader of the Lula administration in
the House of Representatives, supported the initiative of the _ruralistas_ to
add the proposal of Code amendments into next year's voting agenda. It is
worth mentioning that Vaccarezza is currently running for Presidency of the
House.

News travelled fast and took Brazilians at COP 16 aback. [Marina
Silva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Silva), a member of Senate, former
Minister of Environment and Presidential candidate in the 2010 elections, was
in Cancún when [she tweeted about the Forestry
Code](http://twitter.com/silva_marina/status/12516116144328704) [pt]:

> [marina_silva](http://twitter.com/silva_marina): O alcance dos compromissos
> do Brasil em Copenhague para reduzir emissão de CO2 depende da manutenção
> dos avanços da legislação ambiental.

[marina_silva](http://twitter.com/silva_marina): The extent of Brazil's
commitments to reduce CO2 emissions in Copenhagen relies on keeping
environmental law improvements.

Minutes later, [she had a
message](http://twitter.com/silva_marina/status/12517958194569216) to
Vaccarezza:

> [marina_silva](http://twitter.com/silva_marina): Os avanços ambientais não
> podem ser moeda de troca para conquistar a presidência da Câmara. O Código
> Florestal não pode servir à barganha

[marina_silva](http://twitter.com/silva_marina): Environmental improvements
cannot be bargaining chips with which to win the Presidency of the House. The
Forestry Code cannot be used for barter

**Golden Chainsaw Award for efforts towards deforestation**

In Cancún, also on December 8, Greenpeace Brazil members awarded ruralist
[senator Kátia Abreu](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1tia_Abreu) [pt] with
the [Golden Chainsaw](http://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/pt/Noticias/A-Cesar-o-
que-e-de-Cesar-/) [pt], for, as they call it, “her efforts towards
deforestation”. She angrily refused the award, which was delivered by a
Brazilian indigenous woman. Senator Abreu, who owns a farm in the state of
Tocantins and since 2008 is president of the Brazilian Confederation of
Agriculture and Livestock (CNA), travelled to Cancún to spread the word about
CNA's vision of environmental protection and agricultural development as a
viable combination in Brazil.

In order to promote itself during the COP 16, the CNA launched the online
coverage “CNA @ COP16″, with versions in English and Portuguese. The CNA also
presented the product of a partnership with
[Embrapa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empresa_Brasileira_de_Pesquisa_Agropecu%C3%A1ria)
(Brazilian Agricultural and Livestock Research Company) and [the Biomes
Project](http://www.canaldoprodutor.com.br/cop16/en/projeto-biomas/) related
to food supply and environment:

> The world population will increase to nine billion people as of 2050,
> demanding an expansion of 70% in food production. The great challenge of our
> times is to supply this demand, which is the product of a population that
> only grows, and preserve the environment at the same time.

With audio in English and subtitles in Spanish, a video specially made for COP
16 promotes a system where the CNA says it recognizes the importance of
keeping forests standing and of protecting Brazil's ecosystems.

The [project's content](http://www.canaldoprodutor.com.br/cop16/en/projeto-
biomas/) is quite impressive and promising, but journalist and blogger
[Leonardo Sakamoto linked
it](http://blogdosakamoto.uol.com.br/2010/12/07/reserva-legal-esse-corpo-
estranho-ganha-trofeu-frango/) [pt] to the Forestry Code and believes Brazil
is better off without either:

> […] os danos que serão causados pelas mudanças no Código não serão bem
> maiores que os R$ 40 milhões que serão aplicados no programa? Uma coisa não
> exclui a outra, é claro. Mas se tivermos que fazer um acordo, que tal deixar
> tudo como está, sem projeto e sem mudança no Código?  
>  Até para que a CNA não seja acusada de greenwashing, lá fora, e lavagem de
> imagem aqui dentro, não é mesmo?

[…] won't future damage caused by amendments in the Code cost more than the 40
million reais funding this project? They are not mutually exclusive, of
course. But if we have to make a deal, what about leaving the situation as it
is, with neither the project nor Code amendments?  
Nobody wants the CNA accused of greenwashing overseas, or trying to clean up
its image here, right?

The
[announcement](http://www.mma.gov.br/sitio/index.php?ido=ascom.noticiaMMA&codigo=6343)
[pt] of the lowest deforestation rate in the Amazon since 1988 (when
government started keeping track of it) is definitely good news, at 6.451 km2
of the rainforest destroyed. The website [_O Eco Amazonia_ points
out](http://oecoamazonia.com/br/data-amazonia/infograficos/98-a-evolucao-do-
desmatamento-na-amazonia-brasileira) for what this number really means: it
signifies an area bigger than 10 Brazilian capital cities altogether. It is as
if São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, Belém, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre,
Recife, Salvador, Curitiba and João Pessoa had all been cut down in 2010. In
order to give a detailed view on deforestation, the website maps in red the
area of rainforest destroyed through 2008.

As the new Forestry Code still awaits a vote, it seems the debate of
environment and agriculture in Brazil will come up again and again, especially
with the scenario of climate change.
