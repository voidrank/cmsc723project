In defense of Amazon Rivers, on Youtube by xinguvivoparasempre

On August 26 the President of Brazil, [Luiz Inácio Lula da
Silva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva), signed a
decree that transfers the concession to harness the hydroelectric potential of
the [Belo Monte Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Monte_Dam) on the
[Xingu River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xingu_River), in the [State of
Pará](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par%C3%A1), to the [Norte Energia
consortium ](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons%C3%B3rcio_Norte_Energia)[pt],
over approximately 35 years, while also authorizing the commencement of
construction work. This is a [controversial move
](http://www.socioambiental.org/esp/bm/videos.asp)[pt], involving an
investment of 19.6 billion reais and the potential for supplying 26 million
people with energy, at the cost of deforestation, flooding towns and
displacing thousands of people. The government’s action is calculated to give
the impression that the Belo Monte project is being conducted under completely
normal conditions and that the construction of the dam is inevitable. Behind
the scenes, however, the events suggest something rather different.

Behind the government’s official talk of “normality”, people have been
organizing themselves into[ social and environmental resistance movements
](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbkHVtfp9iA)[pt] against the construction of
the dam since the 1970s. They are made up of Indians and river dwellers whose
present way of life and means of survival will suffer a disastrous impact if
the dam is built.

Indigenous people and river dwellers from all over the area of the Amazon
where the hydroelectric plant is being planned have joined together to try to
establish common strategies to halt the damming of rivers in the Amazon
region. These groups are fighting to be heard in order to raise public
awareness and encourage people to join forces with them in demanding the
interruption of the project before the construction phase of the dam. This is
aimed at promoting dialogue, hitherto virtually inexistent, between
stakeholders and those affected by the construction of the dam.

They are counting on the support of people committed to indigenous and
environmental causes. One such individual is Bishop Erwin Kräutler, the last
winner of the prestigious[ Right Livelihood Prize

activist for indigenous rights. Kräutler, Bishop of Xingu, Pará, and President
of the Indigenous Missionary Council,

I am against the project and the authoritarian way in which it has been
carried out, pushing the government’s development-obsessed spiel, which only
talks about Belo Monte’s benefits, never the problems that it will cause.
Around 30,000 people will be kicked out of the [Volta Grande] area and taken
to God knows where. This will be the biggest assault on Amazonia yet.

Also committed to the cause, and one of the leaders of the case brought to the
Federal Ministry of Pará, is the attorney Felício Pontes Júnior, who filed his
first lawsuit against Belo Monte in 2001, ensuring that the project has not
seen any action since then. Had he not done so, the plant would have been
built by now. In total, the Federal Ministry of Pará has seen eight cases
which deal with the trampling of legal procedures and point out irregularities
in the dam’s environmental licensing. None of these claims had come before the
court by September 2 this year, which shows that only a court order can change
the game.

According to Pontes Júnior, the government is trying to the “fait accompli
tactic”, which in law refers to the attempt to circumvent lawsuits by the idea
that once work has been completed, it cannot be reversed. However, the ongoing
cases may still be able to prevent the construction of the plant:

> O governo federal tem soltado release sobre Belo Monte como se o fato já
> estivesse consumado. Temos processos em andamento que, se tiverem decisões
> favoráveis, nós paramos Belo Monte. (…) Nós não desistimos de barrar Belo
> Monte. Queremos barrar a construção da hidrelétrica sim porque todos os
> estudos, da Unicamp, da USP, da UnB, mostram que é uma obra inviável. (…)
> Nós não estamos jogando a toalha.

The federal government talks about Belo Monte as though it were inevitable. We
have cases in motion which, if successful, can stop Belo Monte […] We won’t
give up trying to stop the Belo Monte project. We want to halt the
construction of the dam because all the studies from Unicamp, the USP and the
UnB show that it is unfeasible. […] We refuse to throw in the towel.

The news about Belo Monte reported on
[EcoAgência](http://www.ecoagencia.com.br/index.php
open=noticias&id=VZlSXRlVONVTVFjejZkWaN2aKVVVB1TP) on September 27 shows that
Pontes Júnior has not given up the fight. He and his colleague Cláudio Terre
do Amaral attended a meeting on September 24 with the representatives of the
approximately 12 thousand families living in the Volta Grande area, which
covers 100km of the Xingu River in the Vitória do Xingu municipality. Two
opposing processes have been precipitated in this region by the construction
of the plant: the disappearance of water and the formation of a lake along one
stretch of the river, and the resultant flooding along another. Both phenomena
are devastating for families who survive from fishing and small-scale farming,
and who still do not know what will happen to their land and property if the
plant is built. Pontes Júnior explains:

> Ainda falta muito para que a usina se torne uma realidade, mas estamos
> preocupados com o fato dessas famílias não terem recebido informações
> concretas sobre o empreendimento.

The plant is still a long way from becoming a reality, but we are concerned
that these families have not been properly informed about the project.

  
These families cannot even count on actually benefiting from electricity. One
of their complaints is, quite justifiably, the lack of electricity, despite
the Volta Grande region being only 300km from the Tucuruí dam. The electricity
distribution company has already informed the farmers and river dwellers that
the Light for Everyone programme will not reach the residents of the inlets
that will be flooded if the dam is built.

Under the heading “Attorney fears confrontation at Belo Monte dam site”, the
[Indymedia](http://pt.indymedia.org/conteudo/newswire/2224) [pt] blog reports
Pontes Júnior’s concern that there may be a confrontation between the
indigenous people and construction site employees once work is underway:

> Eu estou extremamente preocupado. Porque o discurso dos indígenas está sendo
> no seguinte sentido: “Nós vamos morrer de qualquer jeito se esse rio [Xingu]
> for barrado, então nós vamos morrer lutando”. Temo por um conflito no
> canteiro de obras dessa hidrelétrica, entre os índios e os trabalhadores da
> construção civil. Isso pode acontecer e, pessoalmente, é o que mais
> angustia.

I am extremely worried. The indigenous people are saying things like, “We’re
going to die anyway if the [Xingu] river is dammed, so we may as well die
fighting.” I fear that there may be a clash at the site of the dam between the
Indians and the construction workers. This is all too possible, and it’s what
worries me the most.

Despite all these impacts and problems, the indigenous people reaffirmed their
stance on the construction of the dam in December 2009, as reported in the[
Brasil Autogestionário ](http://www.brasilautogestionario.org/2010/02/06/belo-
monte-mais-um-presente-para-construtoras/) [pt] blog:

> _Nós, povos Indígenas, não vamos sentar mais com nenhum representante do
> governo para falar sobre UHE Belo Monte; pois já falamos tempo demais e isso
> custou 20 anos de nossa história. Se o governo brasileiro quiser construir
> Belo Monte da forma arbitrária de como está sendo proposto, que seja de
> total responsabilidade deste governo e de seus representantes como também da
> justiça o que virá a acontecer com os executores dessa obra; com os
> trabalhadores; com os povos indígenas. O rio Xingu pode virar um rio de
> sangue. É esta a nossa mensagem. Que o Brasil e o mundo tenham conhecimento
> do que pode acontecer no futuro se os governantes brasileiros não
> respeitarem os nossos direitos como povos indígenas do Brasil._

_We, indigenous people, refuse to sit down any more with government
representatives to talk about the Belo Monte dam. We have already spent far
too much time – over 20 years – talking about it. If it wishes to construct
the Belo Monte dam in the arbitrary way that it is proposing, the Brazilian
government and its officials bear sole accountability and legal responsibility
for what happens to the perpetrators of this work, the laborers and the
indigenous people. The Xingu River could become a river of blood. This is our
message: Brazil and the world should be aware of what might happen in future
if those in power do not respect our rights as the indigenous peoples of
Brazil._

In the same interview, Pontes Júnior revealed that at the meeting of
indigenous people on August 26 they decided to approach the international
courts and ask them to denounce the violation of their rights:

> Eu espero que, com essa decisão, nós consigamos o apoio internacional,
> principalmente das entidades ligadas aos direitos humanos, e também das
> entidades técnicas, a Comissão Mundial de Barragens, por exemplo. Estudos
> técnicos, por exemplo, podem comprovar a inviabilidade econômica dessa
> hidrelétrica.

I hope that with this decision we can secure international support primarily
from bodies linked to human rights, and also from technical agencies like the
World Commission on Dams. Technical studies may, for instance, prove that this
dam is economically unfeasible.
