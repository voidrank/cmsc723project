The movie Birdwatchers raised international awareness for the Guarani

But the evil, violence and human rights abuses is what the Guaraní have found
in Brazil. They represent one of the most numerous indigenous people in the
country (46,000 out of aprox. 734.000), but they continue to be the target of
constant attacks and victims of an alarming rash of suicides. The NGO Survival
International [adds](http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/guarani)

> Today, this manifests itself in a more tragic way: profoundly affected by

This area was inhabited by the [Guarani
Kaiowá](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani-Kaiow%C3%A1), one of three groups
descended from the original Guarani, who inhabited much of the southern
Brazilian coast and the forest region of Brazil’s border with Paraguay. They
were among the first people to have contact with Europeans on their arrival to
South America 500 years ago and, according to the blogger Duda, from [blog al-
azurd](http://al-azurd.blogspot.com/2010/09/guarani-kaiowa.html), the Kaiowá
lived in peace with the “white man” until the late nineteenth century. By
then, however, the situation changed.

It was the Guerra do Paraguay [Paraguay War] that marred the Indians, opening
the door to the Jesuits with their demonic feelings of guilt and shame. Still,
the Kaiowa refused to participate in these evangelizing missions and preserved
their deep spirituality.  
[…]  
From 1880, they were incorporated as manpower on the cultivation and
extraction of [mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29)
explored with great intensity in the region. With time, the government
promoted very intense exploitation and the indigenous territories were
invaded.  
[…]  
While they were needed as manpower, the Kaiowa had permission to stay in their
villages. Afterwards, they were expelled from their ancestral lands, swallowed
by the whites’ frowns who deforested them and built farms.

They have since suffered from the almost total loss of their territory **.**
In [a text of 2003](http://dutracarlito.blogspot.com/2009/02/marcos-veron-
vida-e-alma-guarani.html) [pt], journalist Carlos Dutra explains the agrarian
conflict between the Indians and the farmers

> rapidamente ordena a expulsão dos indígenas do lugar.

From what has been observed of the events, for over 50 years these people have
been trying to recover some of the ancient land that was gradually being
swallowed by the white hand of landowners. Tired of fighting an excessive
regulating law of private property, led by the old chief, in 1997 the
community made their return to their ancestral territory. Soon after entering
the area, as is customary to every people on earth, they began to build houses
and started planting their crops, without which their families could not
survive. But according to the owner, the farmer soon resorts to the Praetorian
**** and to a judge and its positive legislation, quickly ordered the
expulsion of the natives of the place.

The old chief mentioned above, [Marcos
Véron](http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/guarani/marcosveron), is a
symbol of the indigenous struggle for ancestral lands. He was brutally
murdered in January 2003. Veron's killers were freed in 2007. The trial
scheduled for May this year ended up being cancelled and postponed again to
February 2011.  

Egon Heck, a member of the Conselho Missionário Indigenista [Indigenous
Missionary Council] (CIMI), in an article reproduced by the blog Global
Ethics, [presents a panorama of
desolation](http://eticaglobal.blogspot.com/2010/09/territorio-kaiowa-
guarani.html) [pt] and describes the persecution of the Guarani Kaiowá as a
genocide:

> Conforme os relatórios de violência do Cimi (Conselho Indigenista
> Missionário), nos últimos cinco anos, foram mais de 200 assassinatos e mais
> de 150 suicídios; mais de 100 crianças morreram de desnutrição; cerca de 200
> índios presos e mais de 90% das famílias vivendo da cesta básica e outros
> benefícios do governo. Isso dá uma pequena dimensão da dramática situação a
> que está submetido esse povo. Antropólogos e outros cientistas têm
> qualificado semelhante situação como de etnocídio e genocídio.

According to reports of violence by CIMI (Indigenous Missionary Council), in
the last five years, there were more than 200 murders and more than 150
suicides, more than 100 children died of malnutrition, about 200 Indians were
arrested and more than 90% of households were living with basic food allowance
and other government benefits. This illustrates a small extent of the dramatic
situation that these people are subjected to. Anthropologists and other
scientists have described a similar situation as genocide and ethnic cleansing

More alarming statistics on the living conditions of the Guaraní Kaiowá can be
found on the [Repórter
Brasil](http://www.reporterbrasil.org.br/exibe.php?id=1771) website. [Emerson
Guarani](http://tvindigena.ning.com/?xg_source=msg_mes_network), in his blog,
confirms that “violence in Mato Grosso do Sul not only continues but it has
also increased” and describes cases of missing Indians who never returned to
the village. **  
**

The exemption of the judiciary that should investigate and act on the
persecution of Kaiowá has been called into question . According to
[Adital](http://www.adital.com.br/site/noticia.asp?lang=PT&cod=47596), Frei
Tito Information Agency for Latin America,

The question now is the lack of impartiality of the regional judiciary, which
has little sensitivity to these native people, systematically favoring the
farmers and people linked to agribusiness.  
The claims of these leaders are the urgent completion of the identification
and demarcation of all Kaiowá Guarani lands of Mato Grosso do Sul; that within
the next 80 days, FUNAI take necessary steps for the recognition of the
community and stay of the Ambá Kurusu community on their lands, noting that
the FUNAI working group responsible for the identification is paralyzed, that
the punishment of those responsible for the murders of all the Guarani Kaiowá
in recent years on the fight for their rights happens immediately, as well as
the trial of the accused for the murder of the Guarai leadership Marcos Veron;
**** there the commitment of the Federal Police to locate the body of
Professor Vera Olindo, missing for more than six months and to punish the
murderers of Professor Genivaldo Vera; for the trial of the Indigenous Land
Nhanderu Marangatu to begin immediately by the Supreme Federal Court, and the
urgent solution to the tragic situation in which the community Nhanderu
Laranjeira found itself, dumped on the edge of the BR-163, September 2009,
finding themselves in extreme poor health, violence and poverty.

However, to the date they are “systematically encouraging farmers and people
related to agribusiness” and the voices of those who claim on the human rights
of the Guaraní Kaiowá seem not to be sufficiently strong as [the economic
interests of large
corporations](http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6524) such as Shell
and Cosan **** focus on exploration of the sacred land, as NGO Survival
International reports, calling to action to help the Guarani.

begins](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/22/brazil-guarani-kaiowa-
