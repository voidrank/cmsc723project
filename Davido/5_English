It seems that the United Nations campaign [to end poverty by
2015](http://www.endpoverty2015.org/) is just another challenge to be
accomplished by many countries around the globe, although a few countries are
closer to their targets than others.

Brazil, the largest country in South America and home of 194 million people,
has captured the attention of the world for its achievement: [35 million
Brazilians have escaped poverty over the last
decade](http://www.economywatch.com/in-the-news/35-million-brazilians-escaped-
poverty-over-last-decade.21-09.html) thanks to its fast growing economy which
has consequently enhanced the middle class in Brazil.

But [Christian Aid](http://www.christianaid.org.uk/) has raised questions
about the government's effort to overcome poverty in the 2012
[report](http://www.christianaid.org.uk/images/real-brazil-full-report.pdf)
‘The Real Brazil: The Inequality Behind Statistics’ [pdf] it examines:

The Bolsa Familia formerly known as Bolsa Escola was founded in 1995 by
Senator [Cristovam Buarque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristovam_Buarque)
when he was the governor of Brasilia. It transformed later to a national
program by the [Lula da
Silva’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva)
administration in 2003-2011.

**Brazil poverty figures**

  * 16 million is the number of people who still live in extreme poverty – equivalent to the population of the Netherlands, says Christian Aid in [‘The Real Brazil](http://www.christianaid.org.uk/images/real-brazil-summary.pdf)‘ [pdf] in blog [Latin America Bureau (LAB)](http://lab.org.uk/the-real-brazil).
  * 14% is the percentage of women employed as maids, while many others are restricted to ‘typically female’ occupations such as nurses, secretaries and carers.
  * 35,000 is the number of young people who die each year from firearms in Brazil.

Robson Leite, a Member of Parliament from the state of Rio de Janeiro, wrote
on his [blog](http://www.robsonleite.com.br/brasil-atinge-meta-de-reducao-da-
pobreza-estabelecida-para-25-anos/) [pt] that Brazil has reached the goal of
poverty reduction established for 25 years:

> De acordo com a 16ª edição do relatório do Ministério da Fazenda, “Economia
> Brasileira em Perspectiva”, divulgada no final de agosto, a queda da taxa de

**The causes of poverty**

Among a long list of articles and cartoons, [Filip
Spagnoli](http://filipspagnoli.tumblr.com/) defined on his blog [P.a.p.-Blog,
Human Rights Etc.](http://filipspagnoli.wordpress.com/blog-series/causes-of-
poverty/) a series of causes for poverty, such as foreign debt, globalization,
lack of economic freedom, lack of economic growth, education, overpopulation,
family structure, slavery, and overpopulation:

> if we want to reduce the number of poor people we have to know what makes
> them poor in the first place.

On his last article about [rising food
prices](http://filipspagnoli.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/the-causes-of-
poverty-64-rising-food-prices/) he gets more in depth and says:

> …..Poor people do indeed spend a large proportion of their income on food,
> which means that increases in prices have a direct effect on their financial
> situation and can even cause hunger. On the other hand, many poor people
> make their living in agriculture. Higher prices can mean higher incomes for
> them. The poor are, however, increasingly urban poor, and for them higher
> food prices are entirely bad news. So it’s not crazy to blame poverty on
> rising food prices. According to the World Bank, food prices have pushed 44
> million people into poverty in 2010-11.

Still Brazil is a nation that has a long history with poverty, and which in
2012 [has forced nearly 1.4 million children to
work](http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/notitas-de-
noticias/details/poverty-in-brazil-forces-nearly-1.4-million-children-to-
work/16482/), according to official figures released on the [World Day Against
Child
Labor](http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_travail_pub_8.pdf)
[pdf], June 12.

Child labour in Brazil is a phenomenon of an eminently rural nature. According
to the study, the majority of those children work in rural areas, where
poverty prevails and schools are few and far between.

It counts 304,415 children between 5-10 years (9.9%) and 755,973 children
between 11-14 years (36.6%); while overall, there are some of 1.4 million
Brazilian children ranging in age from 5 to 14 in the labour market.

> In the case of children aged 11 to 14 years who live in families headed by
> women  
>  without the presence of a husband, around 12.2 per cent work or are seeking
> employment. On the other hand, almost 15 per cent of children who live with
> couples are in the labour market.

While there is ongoing debate over the government effort to overcome poverty
in the country, new measures for reducing poverty keep being implemented, such
as the [Dom Távora and Paulo Freire Projects](http://ifad-
un.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/knowledge-is-central-to-overcoming.html) worth
US$56 million in funding by the UN's International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD).

The projects “are named after famous Brazilian educators and advocates for the
poor, and look at knowledge as the central tool to overcoming poverty”.
