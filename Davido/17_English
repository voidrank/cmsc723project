Shortly after the September [protests in Maputo that were convened by
SMS](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/01/mozambique-maputo-on-alert-
with-unrest/), the Mozambican government issued a Ministerial decree law
forcing mobile pre-paid phone users on the country's two networks to register
their SIM cards within one month of the decree. This came decision after [the
government pressured the operators to curtail service to pre-paid customers
during the
violence](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/21/mozambique-
government-interference-in-sms-service/).

While the government refers to “criminality” generally, bloggers suggest that
the move is being made to stifle further popular protest organized by SMS.

A question we have to ask is, why is it only after a protest convened by SMS
that the government runs to block mobile phone services? Why did it not do
this when Parliamentarian José Mascarenhas was threatened by SMS and later
assassinated?

Mozambique has an estimated 5.5 million mobile subscribers, of a population of
21 million. Authorities initially threatened to cut off those who did not
register before the November 15th deadline.

In late November, reportedly only a small percentage of subscribers had gone
to register, a process which requires a photocopying of valid identification.
This could only be conducted through the two operators, Mcel and Vodacom, and
their official outlets and resellers. Some provinces only have a handful of
offices serving millions of inhabitants. The operators are now working with
the Post Office and Mozambique Telecommunications to reach more of their
customers.

Mcel's Head of Commercial Operations Benjamim Fernandes [complained on morning
radio about the deadline in late
November](http://www.opais.co.mz/index.php/sociedade/45-sociedade/10930-accionistas-
da-mcel-mandam-cessar-funcoes-administrador-comercial.html) and apparently
within four hours, shareholders had convened and called for his resignation.
Blogger Chauque [commented](http://eagora-
chauque.blogspot.com/2010/11/accionistas-da-mcel-mandam-cessar.html) [Pt] that
Fernandes fell for “ _confronting the Board of Administration and its suck-ups
in suits_ “.

Vodacom voiced its dissatisfaction with the measure, meeting with consumer
defense group DECOM. On its site, DECOM quoted [a legal opinion from anti-
corruption group Center for Public
Integrity](http://www.decom.org.mz/2010/11/registo-de-cartoes-sim-e-ilegal-e-
anticonstitucional-cip/) (CIP) questioning the constitutionality of the Decree

> Nas competências, atribuições e funções do Ministério dos Transportes e
> Comunicações (…) unicamente compete regular as actividades sob sua tutela,
> mas não impor obrigações ou restrições de direitos aos cidadãos em geral

The role and function of the Ministry of Transport and Communication is only
to regulate activities under its watch, but not to impose obligations or
restrictions on the rights of citizens more generally.

The deadline in Mozambique for SIM registration has been extended until
January 7, 2011.

While the question of “net neutrality” heats up in the US, the question of
freedom of access to mobile telephony is of equal significance in many parts
of subsaharan Africa. In addition to emerging economies like South Africa and
Nigeria, other countries like Tanzania, Botswana, Cameroon all have made SIM
card registration mandatory. More countries are considering this in 2011.

In countries like Mozambique recent events have shown that regulators, and
subsequently operators, are prone to political pressure. It is still early to
assess what impact SIM card registration will have on free speech, or whether
it will make mobile usage too expensive or inconvenient for the poor,
especially those in rural areas.
