Hostilities have commenced. On March 12, in many cities across the country and
outside Portuguese delegations throughout the European Union, youth are taking
to the streets. According to the organization, the _Geração à Rasca_ [The
“Scraping-By” Generation] Protest is a “[non-partisan, secular and peaceful
protest, aiming to strengthen participatory democracy in the
country](http://geracaoenrascada.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/convite-a-sociedade-
civil/)” [pt]. It emerged as a spontaneous event on Facebook and, in less than
a month it has gathered more than 50,000 [Update: 64.639] intentions to
participate:

> Nós, desempregados, “quinhentoseuristas” e outros mal remunerados, escravos
> disfarçados, subcontratados, contratados a prazo, falsos trabalhadores
> independentes, trabalhadores intermitentes, estagiários, bolseiros,
> trabalhadores-estudantes, estudantes, mães, pais e filhos de Portugal.
> Protestamos:  
>  – Pelo direito ao emprego! Pelo direito à educação!  
>  – Pela… melhoria das condições de trabalho e o fim da precariedade!  
>  – Pelo reconhecimento das qualificações, competência e experiência,
> espelhado em salários e contratos dignos!

We, the unemployed, the “five-hundred-euro-ists” [referring to monthly wage]
and others, poorly paid, disguised slaves, subcontracted, temps, supposed
“independent workers” [hired as such by employers to avoid Social Security
payments], intermittent workers, interns, fellows, student workers, students,
mothers, fathers and children of Portugal. We protest:  
– For the right to employment! For the right to education!  
– For the improvement of working conditions and for the end of labor
precariousness!  
– For the recognition of [our] qualifications, competence and experience,
reflected in dignified salaries and contracts!

**Underemployment in context**

Last December, [TSF Radio
News](http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Portugal/Interior.aspx?content_id=1737216)
[pt] broadcaster reported on a data set from INE (National Institute of
Statistics) which pointed out that “more than 300,000 young people have no
[economic] activity”. In its website, [the same radio broadcaster said, on
February
24](http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Portugal/Interior.aspx?content_id=1791885&tag=CDS-
PP), that “23 percent of the youth is unemployed, 720,000 have short-term
contracts, and there is a further 14 percent increase in use of _recibos
verdes_ [workers earning in self-employed tax regime] recorded in the last
three months”.

On the blog _Epígrafe_ (Epigraph), Ricardo Salabert, from
_[FERVE](http://fartosdestesrecibosverdes.blogspot.com)_
_[Movement](http://fartosdestesrecibosverdes.blogspot.com/) _(BOIL, an
acronymn for Sick of these Recibos Verdes) [pt],
[explains](http://epigrafe.wordpress.com/2007/12/12/falsos-recibos-verdes/)
this kind of relationship to labor markets:

> Os recibos verdes são um modelo de facturação aplicável aos trabalhadores
> independentes, i.e., às pessoas que prestam serviços ocasionais para
> entidades várias (empresas ou particulares). São exemplo disso os médicos,
> os arquitectos (entre outros) que podem passar recibos verdes aos seus
> clientes, não tendo de se estabelecer como empresa.

_Recibos verdes_ is an invoicing model applicable to the self-employed, ie,
people who provide occasional services for several entities (companies or
individuals). One example is doctors, architects (among others) that can use
them to invoice their customers, without having to establish themselves as a
company.

And so grows the share of workers who lack any kind of social protection (in
sickness, pregnancy, death of relatives), without any holidays or other types
of subsidy. These workers can be sent off by the employer at any time since,
by law, they have no ties with the enterprise. There are tens of thousands of
Portuguese, from all generations, with the status of “false _recibos verdes_ ”
who are providing services to companies under the same conditions of those
with an Employment Contract, as laid out in the [Labor Code (article
12)](http://www.cite.gov.pt/pt/legis/CodTrab_L1_002.html) [pt], that keeps
them “precarious”.

**Music fueling action**

Some might call them the _Neither-Nor Generation_ , as Rui Rocha
[explains](http://delitodeopiniao.blogs.sapo.pt/2474677.html) [pt], on the
blog _Delito de Opinião_ (Crime Opinion):

> Nem estudam, nem trabalham. (…) Tipicamente, esta é uma geração
> potencialmente melhor preparada do que as que a precederam e, aparentemente,
> muito segura de si. São, todavia, presa fácil da degradação do mercado
> laboral e não conseguem encontrar uma saída airosa, nem combater este estado
> de coisas. Os sociólogos identificam uma característica muito comum neste
> grupo: a inexistência de qualquer projecto de vida. As manifestações mais
> evidentes são a apatia e a indolência.

They neither study nor work. (…) Typically, this generation is potentially
better prepared than its predecessors and it is apparently very self-assured.
They are, however, easy prey to the degradation of the labor market and they
cannot find a graceful way out, nor fight against this state of affairs.
Sociologists identify a very common feature in this group: the absence of any
life plan. The most obvious manifestations are apathy and indolence.

Around the end of January, the musical group
[Deolinda](http://www.deolinda.com.pt/) presented in its tour an unreleased
piece that came to stir up emotion, giving a name and a voice to what has
become, thereafter, known as the Foolish Generation.

> Sou da geração sem remuneração  
>  E nem me incomoda esta condição  
>  Que parva que eu sou!  
>  Porque isto está mau e vai continuar  
>  Já é uma sorte eu poder estagiar  
>  Que parva que eu sou!  
>  E fico a pensar,  
>  Que mundo tão parvo  
>  Onde para ser escravo é preciso estudar…

I am from the generation without remuneration  
And it doesn't even bother me this condition  
What a fool I am!  
Because things are bad and it will continue  
Yet I am lucky I have an internship  
What a fool I am!  
And then I wonder,  
Such a foolish world  
Where, to become a slave, one must study …

resist\)](https://pt.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-

Satire to Isabel Stilwell's article, on the Facebook page "artº 21" (article
of the Portuguese Constitution which refers to the right to resist)

Deolinda's song, with an increasing number of 345,000 views on YouTube,
spontaneously became a hymn to the “(now) foolish generation”.

A few days after, the [editorial](http://www.destak.pt/opiniao/87876-a-parva-
da-geracao-parva) [pt] of a free daily newspaper in Portugal, in the words of
its director, Isabel Stilwell, said that “if they studied and they are slaves,
they are fools indeed. Fools for having spent their parents’ money and our
taxes to study and ending up not learning a thing”. In response she received
thousands of comments, multiplying across social media.

The hymn then became the gunpowder that ignited the fuse for [everyone who
feels is paying for mistakes made ​​by the generation that came
before](http://jumento.blogspot.com/2011/02/geracao-enrascada.html) [pt].

**Many problems, few solutions**

If on one hand this has brought some together in common resistance, on the
other hand many others have distanced themselves. It has awoken some semi-
dormant debates.

While the blog _O_ _Jumento_ (Jackass) reflects on [the inter-generational
solidarity (or the lack of
it)](http://albergueespanhol.blogs.sapo.pt/882296.html) [pt], Helena Matos, on
the blog _Blasfémias_ (Blasphemy), questions the
[legitimacy](http://blasfemias.net/2011/03/04/estavam-a-espera-de-que/) [pt]
of this generation to claim the same rights as their parents:

> Preparam-se agora os ditos membros da geração à rasca não para exigir que os
> mais velhos mudem de vida mas sim que também eles possam manter esse tipo de
> vida. Quem vier depois que se amanhe. A prosseguirmos, dentro de alguns
> anos, assistiremos a protestos de gerações que se dirão bem pior do que à
> rasca.

The so-called members of the “scraping-by” generation are now getting ready
not to urge older people to change their lives but to demand that they too can
also maintain that kind of life. Those who come after will manage. Down the
line, within a few years, we will see protests by the generations that will
describe themselves as much worse than “scraping by”.

Luis Novaes Tito appeals for a
[change](http://barbearialnt.blogspot.com/2011/03/nacao-rasca.html) [pt] to
the _status quo_ , on the blog _A Barbearia do Senhor Luis_ (Mr. Luis Barber
Shop), making a warning though regarding the conflict of generations:

> Concordo que, em vez de chorarem pelos cantos embalados pelo faducho do “já
> não posso mais”, vão para a rua gritar que é tempo de mudar, antes que os
> mandem embalar a trouxa e zarpar.

I agree that instead of crying in the corners wrapped up in a Fado-like “I
cannot go on anymore”, just go onto the streets screaming that it's time to
change, before they send you packing and fleeing.

From posts and comments, to editorials and opinion pieces in traditional
media, there are also those who keep trying to push society to the heart of
the problem: causes and solutions (knowing that it is easier to agree on
causes than solutions). So the discussion has extended to the role of the
State and the [legislator](http://albergueespanhol.blogs.sapo.pt/857137.html),
and also to [Universities and institutions of higher
education](http://barometro.com.pt/archives/262).

And so goes Portugal, “a country of mild manners”, whose basket of conformism
may have filled up once and for all. Far from finding a platform for
consultation between the political class, civil society and the very
Generation in question, **** the movement that grew and spread against the
odds now seeks the path to maturity. Today is its first major test to go
through, and, given the fragility of counting on numbers from social networks,
we will only know the true extent of this generation's will to change a
country when the hour comes. And we wait. Anxiously.
