On the television program “Justiça Cega?” (Blind Justice), which airs on the
Portuguese network RTP, the president of the Portuguese Bar Association,
Marinho Pinto,
[claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=SPnKONSkJes)
“one of the things Brazil has most exported is prostitutes, among other
things.”

This statement was made as part of Pinto's comment about the case of Catarina
Migliorini, a Brazilian woman who sold her virginity for nearly 600,000 euros
to Japanese business man Natsu. Marinho Pinto claimed the Brazilian government
“is charging the young woman for prostitution,” but the Attorney General's
Office is actually looking to charge the organizer of “Virgins Wanted” for
human trafficking and prostitution.

There has been no shortage of reactions of indignation to Pinto's statement on
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Brasil.MRE/posts/345933822172056) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/JSnotario/status/276443270173818881) under the

Messages have been left on the Facebook wall of Brazil's Ministry of Foreign
Relations asking that both the ministry and the Association of Immigrants and
Feminists [take a
stand](http://www.facebook.com/Brasil.MRE/posts/513283978704891).

The Office of the Secretary of Women's Policies, one of the presidential
cabinets responsible for drafting and coordinating public policy concerning
Brazilian women, [reacted by
stating](https://www.facebook.com/comunidaria/posts/486261601418581) that the
ambassador of Brazil in Lisbon had already expressed the Brazilian
government's indignation over the statement to the president of the Portuguese
Bar Association.

[In a written
response](http://www.jn.pt/paginainicial/interior.aspx?content_id=2936968&page=-1),
Marinho Pinto said the repercussion of his statement “was only shocking
because it is the truth” and he claims his comment was addressed to the
Brazilian prostitutes who are victims of female trafficking in Portugal.

A Google search for “Brazilian women” reflects the stereotype the country's
women face.

Marinho Pinto's statement brings us back to the polemical discussion about the
image of Brazilian women abroad. It is not uncommon to find Brazilian women
minimally clad and photographs from Carnaval or a beach.

“Journalists and the foreign media in general tend to represent Brazilian
women with a certain degree of maliciousness, an excess of prejudice and
overgeneralization,” [reads an
article](http://www.midiaepolitica.unb.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=31:brasil-
samba-suor-e-sensualidade-o-imaginario-construido&catid=8:edicao-032011)
published in Observatório Mídia & Política (The Media and Policy Observer) by
Katia Belisário, professor at the School of Communications at the University
of Brasília and a doctoral candidate in journalism and society:

> Representações estereotipadas e preconceituosas por parte da imprensa podem
> gerar consequências nefastas, tanto para a imagem da brasileira no exterior,
> quanto para o Brasil como um todo.

> Stereotypical and prejudiced depictions by the press can lead to disgraceful
> consequences both for the image of Brazilian women abroad and for Brazil
> overall.

In her blog, Brazilian Melissa Rossi
[wrote](http://www.beyondsamba.org/2012/11/03/brazilian-women-once-again-
stereoptyped-in-italian-media/) [en] about her experience in Italy and how the
local media was prejudiced in its treatment of her fellow Brazilian women:

Performance art entitled “Carimbada” (Stamping) by graphic designer Janaína
Teles in her [blog Corpo des-mapeado](http://corposmapeados.blogspot.com.br/)
(Unmapping the Body): “I use the stamp as an object that brands and marks the
bodies of others just like our own…. It is witness to an act of self
acknowledgement by this branded and stereotyped woman clearing a path for a
chance to ascribe new significance and identity.”

In February 2012, [Claudia M.
Vieira](http://sairdobrasil.com/author/claudiam/), an attorney and professor
for students pursuing a master's degree in international law and international
relations at the University of Lisbon,
[wrote](http://sairdobrasil.com/2012/02/13/mulher-brasileira-no-exterior-e-
discriminada-sim/ ) on the site[ Sair do Brasil](http://sairdobrasil.com/)
(Leaving Brazil) about the effects of prejudice and discrimination against
Brazilian women abroad:

> É tão grave a situação que as próprias mulheres brasileiras estão mudando o
> comportamento. As que ja vivem mais tempo fora do Brasil, já nem sorriem
> naturalmente, não brincam, não usam as roupas que gostam, tudo isso, por
> medo de sofrer preconceito. No curso de Mestrado da Universidade de Lisboa,
> constatei algumas alunas, falando com o sotaque português para serem

> The situation is so severe that Brazilian women themselves are changing how

Meanwhile, in September 2011 while working on her doctorate about the
depiction of Brazilian women in Portuguese social media, Mariana Selister
started the [Brazilian Women's
Manifesto](http://manifestomulheresbrasileiras.blogspot.com/2011/09/manifesto-
mulheres-brasileiras.html) ([@MBrasileiras](https://twitter.com/MBrasileiras))
as a rejection of the prejudice faced by Brazilian women in Portugal:

> O estigma da hipersexualidade remonta aos imaginários coloniais que
> construíam as mulheres das colônias como objetos sexuais, escravas sexuais,
> e marcadas por uma sexualidade exótica e bizarra. Cita-se, por exemplo, a
> triste experiência da sul-africana Saartjie Baartman, exposta na Europa, no
> século XIX, como símbolo de uma sexualidade anormal. Em Portugal, esses
> imaginários coloniais, infelizmente, ainda são reproduzidos pela comunicação
> social.

> The stigma of hypersexuality goes back to the historical concept of women in
> the colonies as sexual objects, sexual slaves, marked by an exotic and
> strange sexuality. Note, for example, the sad experience of South African
> Saartjie Baartman, exposed in Europe in the 19th century as a symbol of
> abnormal sexuality. In Portugal, these images developed back in colonial
> times are still perpetuated in social media today.

Ending with an appeal that is still current and ever urgent:

> Exigimos, das autoridades competentes, que se faça cumprir a “CEDAW –
> Convenção para a Eliminação de Todas as Formas de Discriminação Contra as
> Mulheres”, da qual tanto Portugal, como o Brasil, são signatários.
> Destacamos, também, o “Memorando de Entendimento entre Brasil e Portugal
> para a Promoção da Igualdade de Gênero”, no qual consta que estes países
> estão “Resolvidos a conjugar esforços para avançar na implementação das
> medidas necessárias para a eliminação da discriminação contra a mulher em
> ambos os países”.

> We demand that the authorities comply with the Committee on the Elimination
> of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), to which both Portugal and Brazil
> are signatories, as well as to the Memorandum of Understanding Between
