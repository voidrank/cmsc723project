Surrounded to the north, east and south by the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Cabinda, Angola's 18th province is waging an ancient struggle for its
independence.

With its dense, wet forest,
[Cabinda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinda_Province) was always the most
disputed of all the provinces in a country whose territory is located far away
from the province. The [oil extracted in the
enclave](http://www.flickr.com/photos/89775718@N00/444011429/) represents
nearly 70% of the crude oil exported by Angola and corresponds to more than
80% of Angolan exports, putting the country in second place in the production
of oil in Africa, just behind Nigeria.

**The borders of the nation**

The majority of the Angolan population says that Cabinda is part of Angola,
but others defend the opposite position.

In 1885, the Portuguese rulers resolved to integrate Cabinda as a protectorate
of the colonial Crown, and in 1920 the territory began to be considered as an
integral part of Angola. Following the Revolution in 1974 in Portugal and with
the process of decolonisation, the political interests obliged Cabinda to
remain Angolan territory. Since that time, opinions on whether Cabinda is
Angola have been divided.

International relations expert Eugénio Costa Almeida [defends the position
that](http://www.angola24horas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=165:cabinda-
e-angola&catid=17:debates-a-debates) [pt],

> Cabinda é parte integrante da República de Angola, mas também tenho sempre
> afirmado que, pela sua especificidade cultural e económica, Cabinda deve
> gozar de um Estatuto especial dentro da Pátrio angolana. Ganharíamos todos,
> sem qualquer dúvida.

> Cabinda is an integral part of the Republic of Angola, but equally I have
> always affirmed that, due to its cultural and economic specificity, Cabinda
> must enjoy a special Status within the Angolan motherland. We would all
> benefit, without a doubt.

The journalist Orlando Castro, who has published several works on the
territorial dispute, such as the 2011 book “Cabinda – Yesterday's
protectorate, today's colony, tomorrow's nation”, and a tireless defender of
Cabindan rights on his blog Alto Hama,
[believes](http://altohama.blogspot.pt/2011/04/direitos-do-povo-de-cabinda-
nao.html) that, just [like East Timor in the
past](https://pt.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/29/angola-similaridades-entre-
cabinda-e-timor-leste/), Cabinda is an oppressed territory and one which has a
right to independence:

> Cabinda é um território ocupado por Angola. E, tanto a potência ocupante,
> como a que o administrou (Portugal), pensaram, ou pensam, em fazer um
> referendo para saber o que os cabindas querem. Seja como for, o direito de
> escolha do povo não prescreve, não pode prescrever, mesmo quando o
> importante é apenas o petróleo.

> Cabinda is a territory occupied by Angola. And, both the occupying power and
> that which governed it (Portugal) thought, or are thinking, about holding a
> referendum to find out what Cabinda's inhabitants want. Be that as it may,
> the people's right of choice does not lapse, cannot lapse, even when the
> topic in question is just oil.

The pro-independence movement [Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of
Cabinda (FLEC),
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_for_the_Liberation_of_the_Enclave_of_Cabinda)[continues
to fight](http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15707993,00.html) [pt] for a solution
to bring independence to this oil-rich territory. In an interview for Deutsche
Welle, Stéphane Barros, representative of the FLEC in Portugal, declared:

> O povo de Cabinda não está interessado numa pacificação militar. O que se
> pretende agora é uma solução política que passe por um processo
> internacional, credível e democrático, porque a vontade do povo de Cabinda
> deve ser ouvida e respeitada”, defendeu o representante da FLEC em Portugal

> The people of Cabinda are not interested in military pacification. What they
> intend now is for a political solution to be achieved by an international
> process, credible and democratic, because the will of the people of Cabinda
> must be heard and respected”, the FLEC representative in Portugal advocated.

During the [elections in
August](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/09/01/angola-voter-silence-also-
speaks/), the Cabindan National Movement, one of various organisations which
is fighting for independence from exile, entertained the idea of boycotting
the elections. [For](http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16183792,00.html)
Bartolomeu Capita, one of the movement's representatives, “there was no
advantage whatsoever for the people of Cabinda to get involved in these
elections. They don't concern us, we are not Angolans and we don't want to
be”.

The party in power, MPLA, managed however to guarantee its re-election in the
province with [59.4% of the
votes](http://eleicoes2012.cne.ao/paginas/paginas/dat01/DLG019999.htm) [pt], a
victory which Stephan Baptista, on Club-k.net,
[attributes](http://club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12861:cabinda-
digere-resultado-das-eleicoes-de-2012-stephan-
baptista-&catid=17:opiniao&Itemid=124) [pt] to various reasons, including the
fact that the majority of the population is based in the periphery, Maiombe,
and is favourable to Angolan sovereignty, while the intellectuals of the
“docile opposition” are a minority and are in the city, as well as the strong
presence of “members of the defence and security forces, the majority party's
lifeline in Cabinda”.

While “speaking about Cabinda today is something which displeases the
political powers in Angola and Portugal, as well as national and global
economic strength”, as Orlando Castro
[maintains](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/02/angola-lack-of-coverage-
on-the-exclave-of-cabinda/), on the other hand the Angolan state press
describes the province as a vision of paradise.

The surroundings of Cabinda are characterised by an abundant vegetation and
views over the Atlantic Ocean. It is not known exactly how many inhabitants
this Angolan province has, as no census has been carried out to date, but it
is estimated that the population is around 400 000, with a particular culture
which has lost some of its traditions in recent years.

Few pages have been created on the social networks to publicise the reality of
the humble people who give life and joy to this mysterious region, but those
which do exist, such as the [Facebook page
created](https://www.facebook.com/groups/6179811378/) [pt] by José Sambo, give
a glimpse into Cabinda's beauty.

A [video-report](http://isildasilva36.wordpress.com/2011/05/28/viajem-e-
divirtam-se/) [pt] shared on the blog Cidade de Cabinda presents various
traditions, practices and costumes of the province. In Cabinda, a number of
dialects are spoken, including Fiote, Ibinda and Kikongo and the official
language is Portuguese. Cabinda is the territory of a people who feel foreign
in their own land and who are still fighting today for their independence.

Cabinda is not only made of smiles: it is also made of [hungry
people](http://rr.sapo.pt/informacao_detalhe.aspx?fid=26&did=73173) [pt]. The
private press gives a voice to critics who paint life in Cabinda as almost
hellish, and threats are regularly made against journalists and activists, as
Global Voices [reported](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/29/angola-
correspondent-cabinda-threatened/) in October 2011. An article by Senator
Barros Navecka on the website Cabinda Nation
