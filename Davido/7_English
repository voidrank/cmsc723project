Since the declaration of Brazil as an independent nation in 1822, Brazilian
identity has gone through several changes spurred by economic, social and
cultural transformations. In a country of [several
races](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/29/brazil-census-black-mixed-
population/) [en], classes, beliefs and traditions, with a great portion of
its population [descending from different
continents](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/03/31/brazil-kilombos-africa-
slaves-documentary/) [en], and marked by drastic regional differences, is
there a common Brazilian identity for every citizen? After all, what does it
mean to be Brazilian?

Even though the Internet is a modern technology, its democratic and inclusive
use can help in the search for an answer. Maybe such answer isn’t a direct
reflection of the Brazilian identity; after all, [less than 50 percent of the
population](http://tobeguarany.com/internet_no_brasil.php) of around 200
million has access to the technology, and among these 50 percent, the
predominance of certain groups can be observed. But the online world gathers
several opinions and with a simple search, many can be found.

Several, in fact, have already tried to answer the question with their own
words – or more importantly, through their own experience. But before we get
to “Brazilian,” it’s worth explaining the concept of nation and nationality.
According to journalist Mauro Santayana, in an article published on the
website [Contexto Livre](http://contextolivre.blogspot.com.br/2011/11/o-que-e-
ser-brasileiro.html) (Free Context):

> A etimologia nos diz que pátria é o adjetivo para a terra de nossos pais. É
> a terra pátria, o que sugere a integração entre a realidade geográfica e a
> comunidade que nela vive, identificada pela língua, pela cultura e, mais do
> que por esses sinais, pelo sentimento de fraternidade (….) é, no fundo, a
> solidariedade cotidiana.

The etymology tells us that nation is the adjective for the land of our
fathers. It is the homeland, which suggests integration between the
geographical reality and the community that lives in it, identified by
language, culture, and, more than these signals, by the feeling of fraternity
(…) it is, deep inside, our daily solidarity.

It’s also important to explain that identity in Brazil was constructed
throughout the years. According to Eliene, in an article for the site [Mundo
Educação](http://www.mundoeducacao.com.br/historiadobrasil/a-identidade-nacao-
brasileira.htm) (Education World):

> A preocupação, de tentar construir uma identidade brasileira, começou no
> século XX, pois no século XIX, grande parte da população não era considerada
> oficialmente como brasileira. A partir de 1930, os órgãos governamentais
> começaram a introduzir elementos na nossa cultura, como por exemplo: o
> futebol, o carnaval, a feijoada, etc. Nesse período, na primeira metade do
> século XX, foi construída a imagem do brasileiro. Um povo cordial, bem-
> humorado, alegre e não racista. Porém, é válido ressaltar que os órgãos
> governamentais tentavam introduzir uma identidade, mas ela só foi aceita
> porque o povo se identificava com ela.

The preoccupation, of trying to construct a Brazilian identity, started in the
20th century, because during the 19th century, a great portion of the
population was not officially considered Brazilian. After 1930, governmental
entities starting introducing elements in our culture, such as: soccer,
carnival, feijoada [typical dish], etc. During this period, in the first half
of the 20th century, the Brazilian image was constructed. A cordial, good-
humored, happy and tolerant people. However, it’s valid to highlight that the
governmental entities were trying to introduce an identity, but it was only
accepted because the people identified with it.

In a very simplistic way, the common link among every Brazilian is the simple
sensation of feeling Brazilian. It seems obvious, but since the publication of
[Casa Grande e Senzala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa-Grande_%26_Senzala)
[en] (Big House and Slave House), by [Gilberto
Freyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilberto_Freyre) [en] in 1933, and
[Raizes do Brasil](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ADzes_do_Brasil)
(Brazilian Roots), by [Sergio Buarque de
Holanda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9rgio_Buarque_de_Holanda) [en] in
1936, much has been
[written](http://books.google.com.br/books/about/As_identidades_do_Brasil.html?hl=pt-
BR&id=9oO0HLYNETUC) and [theorized](http://compare.buscape.com.br/identidade-
nacional-e-modernidade-brasileira-ricardo-luiz-de-souza-8575262815.html) about
such definition. And what about the online community? What does it think?

History Professor Lázaro Curvelo Chaves, categorically opens his
[definition](http://www.culturabrasil.pro.br/serbrasileiro.htm):

> Somos um povo sui generis em vários aspectos. Alguns ditados populares têm
> lá a sua razão de ser. Aqui há “leis que pegam” e “leis que não pegam”,
> depende de a quem se aplica. A rigidez da letra fria da lei esbarra no
> “jeitinho brasileiro”, no “favor”, no quebra-galho.

We are a sui generis people in several aspects. Some popular sayings are
somewhat right. Here, there are “laws that catch” and “laws that don’t catch”,
depending to whom it’s applied. The rigidity of the cold letter of the law
bounces onto the “Brazilian way”, for a “favor”, the troubleshooter.

But what about the notion of soccer, religion and carnival? Yes, some still
define Brazilian in terms of the [national soccer
team](http://celeirodosam.blogspot.com.br/2010/06/paixao-de-ser-
brasileiro.html), others through
[music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNq6WnRHARU), but as Diogo Didler
writes in his website “[Ser Feliz e ser
Livre](http://serfelizeserlivre.blogspot.com.br/2012/06/o-que-te-faz-ser-
brasileiro.html)” (To Be Happy is To Be Free):

> Ser brasileiro vai muito além do que torcer por um time, ser sambista, ter
> uma religião ou gostar de mulher. É, antes de tudo, um exercício de
> cidadania do qual cada um enxerga a nossa realidade e tentar de alguma forma
> mudá-la qualitativamente em benéfico do povo. Ser brasileiro é, ainda,
> exaltar o que realmente temos de melhor e não coisas supérfluas que não
> trazem benefício algum para a coletividade social, mas sim pequenos
> paliativos que com o tempo serão esquecidos.

Being Brazilian goes beyond rooting for a team, being a samba musician, having
a religion or liking women. It is, before anything, an exercise of
citizenship, through which each one sees our reality and tries to shape it
somehow to the benefit of the people. Being Brazilian is, still, to highlight
our best and not the superfluous that bring no benefit to the social
collective, but small palliatives that will be forgotten through time.

On [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com), some people also express their
impressions through the
[#brasileiro](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23Brasileiro) (#Brazilian)
hashtag.

Also, Tiago G. Estevam
([@tiagogestevam](https://twitter.com/tiagogestevam/status/208400339060260865))
agrees that:

> #Brasileiro é uma MultiMistura genética formidável! Por isso temos tanta

#Brazilian is a formidable multimixture genetic! That’s why we have so many
talented people, increasing the qualities of inheritance.

If such identity refers to the national territory, what about Brazilians
living beyond national borders? Does this “Brazilianity” cross territories?
While some [say](http://espelhando.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/coisas-so-de-
brasileiros-como-reconhecer-brasileiro-no-exterior/) it’s easy to recognize
Brazilians living abroad through stereotypes, [Debora
Baldelli](https://pt.globalvoicesonline.org/author/debbaldelli/), co-editor at
Global Voices in Portuguese, recognizes in her blog
[Urbanices](http://urbanices.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/o-brasil-tem-cara/),
that abroad, from a physical standpoint, “the idea that ‘Brazilians do not
have a face (or has all the faces of the world)’ isn’t a worldwide perception
as I thought it was.” Yes, Brazilians have a face and an identity, and even
though everybody is unique, we are also Brazilians, independently from the
localization.

Among so many opinions, is there also Brazilian pride online?

With the question “[Are you proud to be
Brazilian?](http://br.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120224155132AA0WLAU),”
Jessica launched the challenge on the [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com). The
answers are mixed, varying from those who love the country for its natural
resources to those who are not so passionate. The vlogger Catharina Lopes also
tried to express her feelings in the video community
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com).

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38O15Roa6Dg>

But can an online forum and some videos really reflect the opinion found in
the offline world? According to data published on the website [To Be
Guarany](http://tobeguarany.com/internet_no_brasil.php), “there are 79,9
million Brazilian Internet users, being the fifth largest country connected to
the Internet, and with an intense growing rate.” But social inequality is also
present online. According to a [research](http://www6.senado.gov.br/mate-
pdf/87196.pdf) done by the Brazilian Senate in 2011:

> Entre os 10% mais pobres, apenas 0,6% tem acesso à Internet; entre os 10%
> mais ricos esse número é de 56,3%. Somente 13,3% dos negros usam a Internet,
> mais de duas vezes menos que os de raça branca (28,3%). Os índices de acesso
> à Internet das Regiões Sul (25,6%) e Sudeste (26,6%) contrastam com os das
> Regiões Norte (12%) e Nordeste (11,9%).

Among the poorer 10 percent, only 0,6 has access to the Internet; among the
richer 10 percent, this number is 56,3 percent. Only 13,3 percent of blacks
use the Internet, more than two times less than whites (28,3 percent). The
percentage of Internet access in the South (25,6 percent) and Southeast (26,6
percent) regions contrast with the North (12 percent) and Northeast (11,9
percent) regions.

Although numbers have changed a bit during this period, we are still far from
reaching online equality. But if it indeed exists a single Brazilian identity,
it’s precisely this – the diversification of opinions, realities and
experiences united over a common land.
