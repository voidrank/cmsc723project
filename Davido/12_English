The [Portuguese language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language),
spoken by more than 200 million people around the world, has often been
described as the “fatherland” or “motherland” of the Portuguese-speaking
world. On February 21 we commemorated [International Mother Language
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mother_Language_Day),
established by UNESCO in 1999. In a tribute to the Portuguese language in all
its linguistic and cultural diversity, we invite you in this article to
navigate through reflections from Portuguese-speaking bloggers, prompted by
their reading of the [first novel dedicated to the Portuguese
language](http://portalivros.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/jose-eduardo-agualusa-
entrevista-a-proposito-de-milagrario-pessoal/) [pt], _Milagrário Pessoal_ –
the most recent work by the Angolan author [José Eduardo
Agualusa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Eduardo_Agualusa).

The title of this article [was taken](http://mertola-
concelho.blogspot.com/2011/02/um-bom-motivo-para-passar-pela.html) [pt] from
the blog _Mértola_ , in which Carlos Viegas writes that _Milagrário Pessoal_
is:

> uma declaração de amor à língua portuguesa, na sua multiplicidade de falares
> (…) uma viagem pela história da nossa língua, pelos locais e culturas que
> alimentaram a sua enorme riqueza.

a declaration of love to the Portuguese language, in all its variations (…) a
journey through the history of our language, through the places and cultures
which feed its great richness.

Portuguese is the official language of eight countries – Angola, Brazil, Cape
Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe and East
Timor – in four continents – Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Thus, the
language covers a vast area of the Earth's surface ([7.2% of the
planet](http://www.cplp.org/id-22.aspx) [pt]), encompassing an extraordinary
diversity of lives which is reflected in the variety of dialects. It is also
[the fifth most spoken language on the
Internet](http://internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm), according to _Internet
World Stats_ , with around 82.5 million internet users. [Deceased in June
2010](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/06/18/portugal-a-tribute-in-unison-
to-saramago/), José Saramago – the only Portuguese-speaking winner of the
Nobel prize for Literature – said that “[there is no Portuguese language, but
rather languages in Portuguese
](http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo=11005)” [pt]. The writer
Agualusa, in an [interview ](http://portalivros.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/jose-
eduardo-agualusa-entrevista-a-proposito-de-milagrario-pessoal/)[pt] with the
blog _Porta-Livros_ , states that:

> O português é uma construção conjunta de toda a gente que fala português e
> isso é que faz dele uma língua tão interessante, com tanta elegância,
> elasticidade e plasticidade.

The Portuguese language is a combination of all the people who speak
Portuguese and it is this which makes it such an interesting language, with
such great elegance, elasticity and plasticity.

The novel – or the “essay on the Portuguese language disguised as a novel”, as
the journalist Pedro Mexia describes it in a critique entitled _[Politics of
Language](http://ipsilon.publico.pt/livros/critica.aspx?id=266712)_ [pt] –
simultaneously tells a love story and explores the processes of construction
of the Portuguese language. Agualusa, again in the afore-mentioned interview,
confesses to “greatly regretting the disappearance of certain beautiful words
which fall out of usage” and shares the necessity and “obligation to prevent
the death of these words”.

Rui Azeredo, from the blog _Porta-Livros_ ,
[explains](http://portalivros.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/milagrario-pessoal-
jose-eduardo-agualusa/) [pt] that the “[love] story serves solely as a pretext
for the author to pay homage to the Portuguese language” :

> através de uma busca, por parte das suas principais personagens, dos
> neologismos do português. E bem encaixados no meio da história (…) surgem os
> neologismos, como uma aula na qual nem se repara, mas onde tudo se aprende.
> De Portugal a Angola, passando pelo Brasil e outros, corremos os olhos por
> jogos de palavras (novas e velhas, dependendo por vezes da geografia) bem
> lançados por Agualusa.

through a search by the novel's main characters for Portuguese neologisms. And
neatly embedded in the middle of the story (…) we find the neologisms, as if
in a lesson we don't even notice, but in which we learn everything. From
Portugal to Angola, via Brazil and other countries, our eyes run over word
games (both new and old, depending at times on the geographical situation)
cleverly thrown in by Agualusa.

In a [summary](http://circodalama.blogs.sapo.pt/73487.html) [pt] of
_Milagrário Pessoal,_ Bruno Vieira Amaral, from the blog _Circo da Lama,_
considers that “words have power, words are power”. Amaral comments on
excerpts from _Milagrário Pessoal_ \- in quotes as fanciful as they are
representative of the countries to which they refer – in which the Portuguese
language serves as a vehicule for refractory, subversive and nationalist
political practices:

> Palavras também são poder, política no sentido mais lato. Podem significar
> insubmissão, como no caso do timorense que declamava sonetos de Camões.
> Podem significar afirmação nacionalista, como no caso das elites brasileiras
> que passaram a utilizar apelidos de origem tupi. Podem significar subversão,
> como o colonizado que pretende colonizar a língua do colonizador para assim
> o dominar.

Words are also power, politics in the broadest sense. They can reflect
disobedience, as in the case of the Timorian who recited sonnets from Camões.
They can reflect nationalist affirmations, as in the case of the Brazilian
elites who began to use nicknames of Tupi origin. They can reflect subversion,
like the colonised who seek to colonise the language of the coloniser in order
to dominate him.

José Leitão, in the blog _Inclusão e Cidadania_ , [supports this
view](http://inclusaoecidadania.blogspot.com/2010/10/milagrario-pessoal-de-
jose-eduardo.html) [pt]:

> O romance contém pistas preciosas para uma política da língua, que merecem a
> atenção dos cientistas sociais, dos linguistas e dos responsáveis pela
> política da língua portuguesa.

The novel contains precious clues for a policy on language, which deserve the
attention of social scientists, linguists and those responsible for policy
relating to the Portuguese language.

The reflections of _Milagrário Pessoal_ ‘s readers in the blogosphere at times
broach the subject of the controversial [Spelling
Reform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_reforms_of_Portuguese) of the
Portuguese language, which aims to unify and converge the different spellings
used in each Portuguese-speaking country. In his interview with the blog
_Porta-Livros_ , Agualusa states:

> Nunca como agora houve tanto movimento de pessoas e ideias entre todos os
> países de língua portuguesa. (…) E isso faz com que a língua se aproxime.

Never before has there been such a degree of movement of people and ideas
between Portuguese-speaking countries. (…) And this means that the language
comes closer together.

Pedro Teixeira Neves, of _PNETLiteratura_ ,
[quotes](http://www.pnetliteratura.pt/cronica.asp?id=2628) [pt] a passage from
the book and asks:

> «Escreve Moisés da Conceição que a língua portuguesa, sendo já africana na
> sua matriz, pelo demorado convívio pelo árabe, que muito a contaminou,
> necessita de enegrecer ainda mais, afeiçoando-se à geografia dos lugares
> onde estão os seus abundosos falantes. O nosso destino é o de nos engolirmos
> uns aos outros…» Resumindo, é pois, de algum modo, esta a temática-tese de
> fundo onde se inscreve a tinta ficcional deste romance. Crítica velada ao
> acordo ortográfico? Porque não entreler desse modo?…

“Moisés da Conceição writes that the Portuguese language, African in its
matrix as a result of its prolonged cohabitation with Arabic which influenced
it greatly, needs to darken still further, moulding itself to the geography of
the places inhabited by its abundance of speakers. Our destiny is to swallow
one another up…”. In summary, this is in some way the underlying thesis upon
which the fictional side of this novel is overlaid. Concealed criticism of the
spelling reform? Why not read between the lines in this manner?…

Offering no response to his question, Teixeira Neves states that “[language is
a treasure](http://www.pnetliteratura.pt/cronica.asp?id=2628)” [pt] and
concludes:

> Um tesouro guardado não numa arca estanque dos povos que dele fazem uso
> (portanto, que falam essa Língua, o português), antes um tesouro que na sua
> diversidade geográfica e crescimento contínuo mais se enriquece e
> inflaciona. Em suma: a identidade da língua é múltipla, e tal facto não
> representa senão um acrescento, jamais uma subtracção. A língua é elástica,
> corpo vivo que se alimenta do tempo e dos tempos. A língua é uma contínua
> viagem de navegação por mares a cada dia nunca antes vistos ou adentrados.

A treasure held not in a chest sealed from the peoples who use it (thus, who
speak this language, or Portuguese), but a treasure which in its geographic
diversity and continual growth becomes richer and broader. In short: the
language has multiple identities, and this fact can only represent an
addition, never a subtraction. Language is elastic, a living body which feeds
off time and times. Language is a continual voyage through oceans never before
seen or sailed.
