For years, Angola has lived in Portugal's shadow, but things are changing; now
it's money coming from Angolan tourists which is filling up the cash registers
of Portugal's high-end shops. According to a study by Visa Europe,
‘[Mediterranean Rim Tourism
Monitor](http://www.visaeurope.com/idoc.ashx?docid=5b9087d4-de4d-4c62-9346-fe86efabea9a&version=-1)‘
[.pdf], between January and April of this year, Angolan tourists have spent
more than 87 million euros in Portugal.

In 2011, Angolan tourists spent more than 59.6 million euros, which is an
increase, in 2012, of 30 million euros. Orlando Castro, Angolan journalist and
author of the blog Alto Hama,

majority of the population of Africa live on less than 100 euros per day,

> o perfil do povo angolano, que representa 70% da população, é pé descalço,
> barriga vazia, vive nos bairros de lata, é gerado com fome, nasce com fome e
> morre pouco depois com… fome.

The profile of 70% of the population of Angola, is that they are barefoot,
have empty stomachs, live in a slum, are conceived amidst hunger and born
hungry before dying shortly after…still suffering from hunger.

According to Orlando Castro, the Angolan tourists spending money in Portugal
are primarily “men in their forties, businessmen from the construction
industry, ex-soldiers or men with links to government”.

The Angolans, who constitute 30% of the Portuguese luxury market, spend
approximately 350 euros on each item they buy. Orlando Castro reinforces this,
saying:

> É comum uma loja de luxo facturar, numa só venda, entre 50 e 100 mil euros,
> pagos por transferência bancária ou cartão de crédito.

It's common for these luxury shops to turn over between 50 and 100,000 euros
during one sale, paid either by bank transfer or credit card.

Spending by the Angolans as well as the Mozambicans is among those showing the
largest increase. Angola is already second in the list of countries most
commonly buying from Portugal.

The study by Visa Europe also reveals that cash withdrawals reached a total of
220 million euros between January and April 2012, “and practically all sectors
have experienced an increase in expenditure by foreign visitors to Portugal”.

At the start of the year, European Parliament President, Martin Schulz
[claimed](http://www.publico.pt/Pol%C3%ADtica/presidente-do-parlamento-
europeu-diz-que-o-futuro-de-portugal-e-o-declinio-1532912) [pt] that the
injection of Angolan capital would contribute to Portugal's “decline”, given
that money which comes from states where democracy is questioned, jeopardizes
the values of Portuguese democracy.

Martin Schulz's words were

According to the President of the European Parliament, Portugal should turn to
the other European States. However, a majority of these states are currently
experiencing an economic crisis themselves, and so in order to try and get
itself out of this situation, Portugal has turned to states where democracy is
considered a “utopia,” such as Angola and China.

Angola's greatest economic partners, such as China, Brazil and Portugal, have
been indirectly feeding corruption by conceding credit lines for oil and also
establishing opaque bilateral economic agreements.

Despite this, the Portuguese government continues to work in partnership with
Angola; Rafel Marques de Morais has said that,

> tais comportamentos asseguram que pouco ou nada se altere em Angola, excepto
> o dinheiro envolvido que se torna cada vez mais apetecível.

carrying on in this way will result in little or no change in Angola, except
for the money involved, which will become increasingly attractive.

In his blog, Pegadas Luís Moreira [confirms
that](http://pegada.blogs.sapo.pt/1583818.html) [pt],

> a pouco a pouco o dinheiro angolano vai dominando empresas e sectores
> económicos em Portugal, desde a banca, à comunicação social, aos sectores
> agrícolas do azeite e do vinho.

little by little we see Angolan money starting to dominate businesses and the
economic sectors in Portugal, from banks, to the media, to the wine and
cooking oil industries.

An [article](http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16119429,00.html) [pt] published
at the end of July by Deutsche Welle indicates that for Portuguese Joint-
Minister and minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Miguel Relvas, relations with
Angola are “inseparable, hence the reason that we have seen an increase of
Angolan investment in Portugal”. The minister was involved with the closure of
a public radio programme in January 2012, after a story –
[reported](https://globalvoicesonline.org/?p=288837) by Global Voices – was
broadcast which criticised the control over the Portuguese media by Angolan
economic groups.

In his Pegadas blog, Luís Moreira, [points out
that](http://pegada.blogs.sapo.pt/1393138.html) [pt]:

> o grande problema de aceitarmos como sócios países não democráticos e sem
> estado de direito é que os novos sócios, rapidamente, olham para o nosso
> país como olham para o deles. Tudo se compra, não há limites à trafulhice,
> nem à ganância.

the biggest problem with forming partnerships with non-democratic and
countries not governed by law, is that any new partners which come into the
equation very quickly begin looking at Portugal the same way that they look at
these non-democratic countries. With everything you buy there are no limits to
cheating and greed.

In May 2011, Invest Lisbon, a partner of
[AICEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AICEP) (which aims to encourage foreign
investment in Portugal), organised a conference in Luanda aimed at attracting
Angolan investors, a specific group of entrepreneurs with the capability and
scope to invest internationally, and the slogan was ‘[Lisbon is your capital
of
Europe](http://www.investlisboa.com/old/images/stories/doc_pdf/media/10_PR_Luanda.pdf)’
[.pdf, pt].

In the Maka Angola blog, it is [ stated
that](http://makaangola.org/2012/07/26/o-predio-dos-angolanos-no-estoril-sol/)
[pt],

> entre o investimento legítimo e o branqueamento de capitais, Portugal
> contínua a ser o destino preferido dos ricos angolanos e a sua melhor
> lavandaria financeira.

between legitimate investment and money laundering, Portugal continues to be
the country of choice for rich Angolans, and the best place for them to
launder their money.

In this new-found Angolan wealth, people both have and spend a lot of money,
they travel a lot, all over the world, they buy palaces and mansions, they
cannot count this wealth on their hands due to their immense purchasing power.
And such is the life of the wealthiest Angolans, they continue along the path
of money indifferent to the poverty affecting the majority of Angola. The
inequality in Angola, Luanda in particular, is enormous, aberrant and absurd
for a country which still has not affirmed itself or found itself

Portugal is, therefore, an obligatory destination for Angolans with money who
will continue to take a chance on it, indifferent to the economic crisis which
is devastating Europe.
