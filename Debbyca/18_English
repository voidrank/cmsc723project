Earlier this week the [first
case](http://www.reuters.com/article/americasCrisis/idUSLP440320) of the new
H1N1 flu, or [swine
flu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_outbreak), was confirmed in
Bahrain, arriving with a Bahraini student who had been in New York. As in
[other parts of the Arab
world](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/14/mena-does-swine-flu-spread-
from-touching-pigs/), however, the threat of swine flu has taken on political
and religious ramifications, with Bahrain's MPs calling for a [ban on
pork](http://arabnews.com/?page=24&section=0&article=121982&d=28&m=4&y=2009&pix=world.jpg&category=Gulf%22).
Some bloggers are not impressed.

_The Dude_ [says](http://letsblamesociety.blogspot.com/2009/05/pesky-
swine.html):

> Great.  
>  Fantastic.  
>  Wonderful.

> Swine flu. Swine bloody flu. The man-made disease that has nothing to do
> with bloody swine has arrived on our sunny shores, despite parliament’s
> ridiculous attempt to prevent it from doing so by banning pork. Hurrah!
>
> It was bound to happen. Not just because of the utter ignorance of our
> elected peers who were likely delighted by the emergence of this new strain
> of evil, but because Bahrain is a prime candidate for such a disease –
> especially now that students are coming home from all across the world for

_Ammaro_ has written a satirical tale called “Sweating Like a Pig”. We join
the protagonist Ahmed halfway through the story, as he goes to the parliament
to request the help of the MPs in relieving an intense
[heatwave](http://www.ammaro.com/2009/05/sweating-like-pig.html):

> He stood in the middle of the hall, and pleaded to them: _“Oh great MPs, we
> have a situation on our hands. The temperature of Bahrain is rising. Just an
> hour ago, I noticed the temperature at 53 degrees [127 Fahrenheit] in my
> car, and it only seems to have gone up since then. This heat is causing
> damage to our infrastructure, causing problems to our telecom systems that
> cannot handle these temperatures, and affecting our people, turning them
> into zombie-like mobs who cannot think. I plea with you to solve this
> problem.”_
>
> One of the MPs stood up and said; _“We already know the reason for the
> problem. It is because of the 1, 2 and 3 star hotels
> serving[alcohol](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/04/02/bahrain-ban-on-
> alcohol-sought/).”_
>
> _“What!?”_ Ahmed said, _“How the hell does that contribute to temperature
> change?!”_
>
> _“Oh unwise one,”_ the MP continued, _“God does not like these petty hotels
> serving the forbidden drink, therefore he has condemned us to a sample of
> hell”_
>
> Ahmed: _“Umm, and what about the 4 and 5 star hotels then?”_
>
> MP: _“You ask too many questions! Don't question the wisdom of the mighty
> MPs! We also need to make sure the pork is banned, otherwise our land will
> be cursed for ever!”_

zombies”), see [here](http://www.ammaro.com/2009/05/sweating-like-pig.html).

We end with a question by _[Silly Bahraini
Girl](http://sillybahrainigirl.blogspot.com/2009/05/blog-post.html)_ :

اذا الخنزير حرام وانفلونزا الخنازير تنتقل من الخنزير إلى الإنسان، فهل انفلونزا
الخنازير حرام أم حلال؟؟

If pigs are [haram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haraam), and swine flu is
transmitted from pigs to humans, is swine flu haram or
[halal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halaal)??
