On Monday, 22 June, Bahrain's oldest newspaper in circulation _[Akhbar Al
Khaleej](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhbar_Al_Khaleej)_ was suspended for
the day after printing an [article](http://www.akhbar-
alkhaleej.com/ShowArticle.aspx?X=7A5470547554715476547C6475547E647764282WIDE71527163716WIDE71622171717873727C727372777278287A5470547554715476547C6475547E647764)
[Ar] critical of certain Iranian leaders and making reference to Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's alleged [Jewish
origins](http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=3.0.3453339770).
The move would seem to have been made to [avoid provoking
unrest](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8112993.stm) amongst the Shi'a
majority in Bahrain.

_Yagoob_ was [not pleased](http://elzeeyed.com/ydome/?p=422):

> This comes as another blow to freedom of speech in Bahrain, after seeing a

> censorship](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/01/28/bahrain-bloggers-

> which conveniently blocked everything from opposition websites, pornography,
> gambling, anti Islamic websites, web proxies and Google Translate, it seems
> that the ever enlongating arm of censorship has hit the mainstream media!

> The strangest and most shocking thing about this ban is that it is _Akhbar
> Al-Khaleej_ , a newspaper which is predominately pro-government. […] So what

_Mahmood_ also disagreed with the
[decision](http://mahmood.tv/2009/06/22/newspaper-banned-in-bahrain/):

> Not that I love _Akhbar Al-Khaleej_ , nothing could be more remote from the
> truth, but my feeling for this decrepit paper, its publisher or some of its
> so called journalists is completely immaterial, but it should not have been
> banned under whatever reason given or withheld by whatever organ of
> government dictating this latest ban on freedom of speech. […] My sources
> tell me that the paper was banned due to a rather cutting article by the
> infamous Shura Council MP Ms. [Sameera
> Rajab](http://www.shura.bh/en/Council/MPs/2006MP47/Pages/default.aspx) who
> is no stranger to controversy. She is loathed by a great swathe of people in
> Bahrain due to her background and rather critical writings especially about
> the Shi’a and their beliefs. It is also no secret that she detests the
> regime in Iran and has been very sympathetic to the Iraqi regime of Saddam
> Hussain.

> Regardless, banning a paper because of a column is a slap in the face of the
> freedom of information that the Ministry has been at pains to promote –
> rather paradoxically, especially that it has made it their professional
> hobby to block websites.

However, not all bloggers were unhappy with the suspension; _Green Oasis_ was
[pleased](http://ba7rani87.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post_22.html):

تستحق الجريدة هذا الاغلاق لانها مشاركة في نشر هذه الاصوات النشاز […] شكراً
لوزارة الإعلام على الاغلاق

The newsaper deserves to be closed because it participates in publishing these
discordant voices. […] Thank you to the Ministry of Information for the
closure.

_Update:_ For _Yagoob's_ perspective on how the suspension was lifted, see
