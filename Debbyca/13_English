Last December, Sinisa Boljanovic [translated a number of heartrending
childbirth stories](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/18/serbia-the-
mother-courage/), written anonymously by Serbian women and posted on the
“Mother Courage” [award-winning
site](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/30/serbia-blogger-krugolina-
borup-wins-disruption-prize/), launched and maintained by Serbian blogger
Branka Stamenkovic/Krugolina Borup.

Earlier this month, LJ user _germanych_ , a Russian blogger, asked his readers
to share their experiences of giving birth in the Soviet Union. While Branka
Stamenkovic's “Mother Courage” initiative is an attempt to change the
situation for the better, the Russian blogger's goal has been to document a
lesser-known chapter of the Soviet history.

In the initial post, he [wrote](http://germanych.livejournal.com/138984.html)
(RUS):

> […] For some reason, I have an impression that Soviet nurses […] treated
> women in labor as if it was wartime and the woman was having a baby from
> some SS officer. That is, with some hatred mixed with squeamishness. For no
> apparent reason. It was a strange thing to hear about, considering that in
> movies they were showing the opposite: when mother and child were leaving
> the maternity hospital, nurses were flying around them, all so kind, all
> smiles.
>
> […]
>
> So here is a question to the women reading this blog: would you please share
> your impressions of the atmosphere that surrounded you in the Soviet
> maternity hospitals? […]

The feedback that LJ user _germanych_ received from his readers prompted him
to write [a follow-up post](http://germanych.livejournal.com/139656.html)
(RUS), in which he quoted over 20 bloggers, some of whom shared stories that
were not their own but their female relatives’ (a few comments were submitted
by male bloggers). Below is a sampling from this collection.

[_terkat_](http://terkat.livejournal.com/):

LJ user [_kialu_](http://kialu.livejournal.com/), who had her child at the age
of 18, shared a similarly horrifying experience and ended her comment with
these words:

> […] For ten years, my son's birthday was for me the day of nightmarish
> memories. Fear and horror mixed with shame. I've gotten over it now. But my
> son is 16 now, and I haven't had it in me to have a second child – and will
> never do…

LJ user _germanych_ also posted a few memories of those who had their children
delivered abroad or more recently – “for comparison”:

> [_klepak_](http://klepak.livejournal.com/):
>
> The conditions at maternity hospitals have changed – children are not taken

Here is LJ user _germanych_ ‘s conclusion to this post:

> […] Judging by additional comments, […] nothing has changed in many of
> today's Russian maternity hospitals since the [Soviet times] – same
> rudeness, dirt and torturing of the women […]. But there is nothing
> surprising about it, because in state institutions of the Russian Federation
> the same contemptuous treatment of human beings still survives the way it
> was [in the Soviet times]. Basically, maternity hospitals are the die-hard
> bastions of [the Soviet system]. The newly-emerged commercial maternity
> hospitals somewhat solve the problem with the availability of normal, safe
> childbirth care. In general, I think that the global reforms in Russia
> should begin with [reform of] maternity hospitals.

And here is [another follow-up
post](http://germanych.livejournal.com/141633.html) by LJ _germanych_ , on the
impact of the previous one:

> […] The post has generated the total of about a thousand comments and has
> spent a few days in the [Top 30 posts at Yandex Blogs portal]. Moreover, it
> was the #1 post for the whole day. […] But this is not the main thing.
>
> The main thing is that a number of readers have labeled me a very non-
> objective person, who has deliberately collected all kinds of dirt and thus
> provoked equally dirty comments. Like, those women who had an okay
> experience with Soviet maternity hospitals just didn't want to write
> comments at such a place.
>
> Well, to prove that I am all for the all-inclusive objectivity, I've decided
> to take out comments from that very first post, which talk positively about
> Soviet maternity hospitals and arrange them into a separate post. And I'd

> comments will it get? […]

Here are just two of these “positive” comments:

> [vladimirgin](http://vladimirgin.livejournal.com/):
>
> When I was being delivered, the level of care was perfect – because the
> midwife and the doctor were my mother's friends. […]
>
> ***
>
> [shisho4ka](http://shisho4ka.livejournal.com/):
>
> 1990\. […] Normal impressions… […] Medical staff acted in a correct way.
> Without rudeness, but without special love and care, either. In general, at
> that time I felt that I was lucky, had been expecting worse treatment…

In a yet another [follow-up
post](http://germanych.livejournal.com/142078.html), LJ user _germanych_
summarized the results of his “balanced approach” blogging experiment:

> As expected, the post about how good Soviet maternity hospitals were neither
> made it into the top ranking at Yandex, nor generated even a hundred
> comments. For some reason, there haven't been too many people ready to
> support the theory that all kinds of horrors written about Soviet maternity
> hospitals had nothing to do with reality. […]

LJ user _germanych_ also quoted this “positive” comment (that has since been
deleted by its author), to emphasize what the Soviet system was really about:

> I, too, cannot say anything bad about Soviet maternity hospitals, since my
> father-in-law was [a high-ranking Communist Party official]…
