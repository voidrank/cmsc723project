The alleged owner and blogger of the blog _Ze Utamu_ (zeutamu.com) has been
arrested in Tanzania.

The alleged arrest has been in discussed at [Jamii
Forum](http://www.jamiiforums.com/habari-hoja-mchanganyiko/31691-ze-utamu-
blogger-under-arrest.html), a popular Tanzanian Online Forum, since yesterday.
And today, [Swahili Time](http://swahilitime.blogspot.com/) has posted the
news along with a picture of the arrested blogger, Malecela Peter Lusinde, 39,
an IT consultant from Essex in the UK.

Swahili Time [reports](http://swahilitime.blogspot.com/2009/06/ze-utamu-
blogger-adakwa.html) that Tanzania’s police in cooperation with their UK
counterparts have collected enough evidence to conclude that Lusinde is the
owner of [Ze Utamu Blog which was blocked in
February](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/03/tanzanian-blogger-faces-
jail-term-over-manipulated-photographic-images/) after publishing manipulated
photographic images depicting Tanzania’s President Jakaya Kikwete engaging in
lewd sex acts.

Legal aspects of the arrest are not yet clear. Tanzania does not allow dual
citizenship and since Mr Lusinde is a UK citizen of Tanzanian origin, it is
not yet known under which law Lusinde will be charged. The post in the
_Swahili Times_ says:
