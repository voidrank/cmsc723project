May 18 marked the 65th anniversary of _Sürgün_ , [the 1944
deportations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCrg%C3%BCn) of [Crimean
Tatars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars) from their homeland in
[Crimea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea).

J. Otto Pohl [wrote](http://jpohl.blogspot.com/2009/05/sixty-five-years-since-
deportation-of.html) about the history of the deportations, and here is an
excerpt from his post:

> On 18 May 1944, the Soviet NKVD began the systematic round up and
> deportation of nearly the entire Crimean Tatar population from their
> ancestral homeland to Uzbekistan and the Urals. Early in the morning armed
> troops of the NKVD started knocking on the doors of Crimean Tatar houses and
> informing the inhabitants that they were to be deported. The official
> explanation given for this mass uprooting of women, children, elderly, Red
> Army veterans and even members of the Communist Party was the false claim
> that the Crimean Tatar nationality had collectively betrayed the Soviet
> Union and collaborated with the Nazi occupiers. […]
>
> On the first day of the operation, the Soviet security organs took 90,000
> people to train stations of which 48,400 began their journey eastward
> (Bugai, doc. 11, p. 138). The following day the number of Crimean Tatars
> transported to rail stations increased to 165,515 of which 136,412 had been
> loaded onto train echelons bound for Uzbekistan (Bugai, doc. 12, p. 138).
> Finally on 20 May 1944, the NKVD completed the operation. They reported
> loading a total of 180,014 Crimean Tatars into 67 train echelons of which 63
> with 173,287 deportees were already on their way to their new destinations
> (Bugai, doc. 13, pp. 138-139). On the same day the NKVD also reported
> mobilizing 11,000 Crimean Tatar men for forced labor, bringing the total
> number of Crimean Tatars removed from Crimea to 191,014 (Ibid.). A total of
> 23,000 soldiers and officers of the internal troops of the NKVD and 9,000
> operative workers of the NKVD-NKGB participated in this operation (Bugai,
> doc. 21, p. 144). The NKVD succeeded in ethnically cleansing Crimea of its
> indigenous population in a mere three days.

Maria Sonevytsky of _My Simferopol Home_ [posted photos from the memorial
event](http://mysimferopolhome.blogspot.com/2009/05/deportation-
day-65-years.html) that took place in
[Simferopol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simferopol) on May 18 – and
described the current plight and the attitudes of the Crimean Tatar who have
returned to live in Ukraine:

> Over dinner in Simferopol with my adopted Crimean Tatar family last week,
> Ayder, a veteran of the Crimean Tatar human rights war against the USSR,
> used the term “genocide” to describe the present Ukrainian non-policy
> towards Crimean Tatars. He cited the attacks by militia groups on Crimean
> Tatar businesses and homes over the last twenty years, the inadequate
> implementation of protections for the indigenous people and the minority
> population, the alarmist attitude towards their Muslim minority group,
> framed without cause for extremism and denied land permits to build a new
> sobornaya mechet’, and so on. In my cautious academic way, I suggested that
> genocide was perhaps too strong a term: as careless and irresponsible as the
> Ukrainian government has been towards the Crimean Tatars, an indigenous
> people of Crimea, genocide implies a systematic, violent destruction of an
> entire ethnic group. It is more sinister than the bumbling indifference of
> the Ukrainian state. No, he asserted: “we are uncomprehending witnesses to a
> subtler form of genocide. The Crimean Tatars are being choked out of
> existence.” […]

Here is what Maria writes about the changes that must occur for the situation
to improve:

> […] A multi-ethnic Ukraine must exist, and its ideal should not be for
> stalemate, a platitudinous tolerance; Ukraine must seek a deep acceptance
> and respect for its diverse minority and indigenous groups. A propos to the
> Crimean Tatar situation, the Ukrainian government should finally approve a
> law to grant the indigenous people of the Crimean peninsula rights and
> protections as a threatened, indigenous people of their ancestral homeland:
> land rights, education in the native language, an end to religious
> discrimination, and ultimately, a right to self-determination within the
> territory of Ukraine.
>
> We can learn from a [[Hutsul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutsuls)]
> musician who I spoke to a few weeks ago, during the Easter holidays. We sat
> in his ancient Volga as he played me old cassette tapes and told me his
> deportation story. His family had been deported to Siberia during the war
> and not allowed to resettle in the [[Ivano-
> Frankivsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivano-Frankivsk)] oblast until the
> 1970s. Reading about the Crimean Tatar non-violent resistance of the 20th
> century, their fierce support of the Orange revolution in 2004, and their
> annual celebration of Taras Shevchenko's birthday, he asked me for a
> recording of a Crimean Tatar violinist from whom he could learn some
> traditional melodies. I asked him why, and he said, “to show my respect, as
> they’ve been showing it to us.” In place of fear, respect. In place of dim
> hostility, a desire to understand. In place of ignorance, education. […]
