Last week, on May 21, a short film about torture in [the Spiritual
Rehabilitation Center “Crna Reka”](http://www.sretenje.org/), located in
south-western Serbia, was shown on the web site of [the Time ( _Vreme_ ),
](http://http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=866444) a Serbian weekly
magazine. The patients of this center are drug addicts and its head is
Branislav Peranovic, a Serbian Orthodox priest.

Nearly all Serbian media have shown the horrible scenes from the short film,
in which Peranovic is shown beating one of the patients brutally with a spade
and with his fists.

Ombudsman of citizens, Sasa Jankovic, is one of the officials who reacted very
quickly. [According to the _Vreme_ web
site](http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=866158), Jankovic said that he had
brought criminal charges against nine identified persons from the Spiritual
Rehabilitation Center “Crna Reka” near Novi Pazar because of quackery and
committing assault and battery. Jankovic also said that, according to the
video, it was obvious that the patients of the center had been injured very
seriously and that could not be a treatment or therapy.

Serbian bloggers reacted to the report very quickly, too, and so did
representatives of the Spiritual Rehabilitation Center “Crna Reka” and the
Serbian Orthodox Church.

Ivan only posted the video instead of words [on his
blog.](http://glavnibaja.blogspot.com/2009/05/kako-crna-reka-leci-

Silja, one of patients of the “Crna Reka” center,
[says](http://www.sretenje.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72%3Ajedno-

> Center “Crna Reka” – the attacks in which all the media in Serbia took part:
> stop condemning the center’s staff for something that they had no personal
> experiences with. It is an absolute falsehood that torture is used as

Serbian blogger Markos [wrote](http://tristacuda.blogspot.com/2009/05/crna-
reka-policija-istrazuje-lecenje.html) on his blog on the web site titled
_Trista cuda_ :

> […] Some of the parents who were at the camp yesterday had an absolutely
> different opinion from the majority of the public regarding the brutal
> methods of re-education of drug addicts. […]

Markos quoted a statement of Vera from Novi Sad, mother of one of the
patients:

> “My son has been staying there for four years. If he had not come to the
> center, he would have not survived. I bought a rope for him and I said to
> him that he should hang himself if he could not live without drugs.”
>
> She added that she was against torture. But treatment in the Institute for
> Substance Abuse didn’t help her son. He came out from there after [nine
> sorts of remedies had been tried on him, but still remained a drug addict].

Blogger Nikola Knezevic
[quoted](http://blog.b92.net/text/9932/Slu%C4%8Daj%20Crna%20Reka%3A%20Po%C4%8Detak%20epiloga/)
a statement of the Holy Synod of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, among
other things. Here is an excerpt of it:

> The Holy Synod of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church received with
> astonishment and regret news about brutal violence toward patients of the
> substance abuse in monastery Crna Reka in the Rasko-Prizrenska Eparchy.
> Records which were shown and acknowledgment by clergyman are irrefutable
> evidence of violence which is absolutely unknown to evangelic spirit and the
> Church’s mission.
>
> Because of that, Synod calls reverend bishop Artemije to immediately dismiss
> illegal stationary and bring church-legal action against clergymen who
> committed the violence. […]

Knezevic concluded his post with these words:

> What astonished and shocked as much as the incident did is the high level of
> masochism of parents. In accordance with the principle “the end justifies
> the means,” they were absolutely indifferent to or supported the way in
> which their children were treated in the “Crna Reka” center. It is surely
> one more alarming sign that violence has become acceptable in our society.
