Reporter Yuka Okada from the Japanese tech news site
[ITmedia](http://www.itmedia.co.jp) brandished her well-regarded interviewing
skills for a one-on-one session with Mochio Umeda. The result was “The
Japanese web is ‘disappointing': An interview with Mr. Mochio Umeda” [Part
One](http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0906/01/news045.html) and [Part
Two](http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0906/02/news062.html) [ja]. In
reaction, the Japanese blogosphere had to give their two cents about Umeda,
Hatena, and the Japanese web.

Part One of this article offers a summary of the interview with translated
excerpts, focusing on the parts that were more heavily-referred to by
bloggers. _[Note: Due to copyright issues, the original Japanese text from the
interview is not included.]_ Part Two will highlight some of the discussions
in the blogosphere and Twittersphere.

Okada starts off by noting that Umeda hasn't written about the Japanese web
recently, and asks if his interests have moved onto _shogi_ , Japanese chess.
Umeda replies that he is currently taking a sabbatical, having published seven
books after “Web Shinkaron” (”Theory of Web Evolution”).

It's not that I deliberately refrain from talking about the current state of
the web. However, there is something that disappoints me – how the English web
and Japanese web have become very different things.
