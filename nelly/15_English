Globalization is often touted as the solve it all solution of the problems
this world faces today. However there are several very highly toxic effects of
globalization as well. For instance these seemingly dissipating borders means
that the western world has been and even now is engaged in dumping its plastic
and medical waste to third world countries. They are able to do so as there is
a lack of whistle blowing as well as checks and balances in countries like
Pakistan, which has been subjected to dumping for the last 30 odd years.

[Skeptic life](http://scepticlife.blogspot.com/2012/04/pakistan-becoming-
dumping-ground-for.html) reports:

One begins to wonder, how are Pakistan’s authorities allowing this dumping of
hazardous materials on our soil? The case though is a multilayered one with
many of these materials being passed off and misdeclared in our customs under
“plastic scrap” and other categories to be cleared and sold off by importers.
What they cannot sell off they dispose, so they are hand in hand with the
whole process. Many of our hospitals too are often found disposing medical
waste in their own backyards or adjacent rubbish heaps, to the extent that
several [unborn fetuses](http://speakforchange.org/female-foetuses-disposal-
why/) have been routinely popping up all over Karachi in waste heaps.

Day and night news reported on just such an incident on [their
blog](http://www.dayandnightnews.com/2012/01/gmch-32-dumping-medical-waste-in-

[Pakistan
today](http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/04/01/news/profit/trading-death-
in-bulk/?printType=article) also discussed in detail the joys of importing
plastic waste borne diseases in Lahore:

> In Pakistan purchasing diseases is quite an easy task. In fact if you want
> to purchase an infection from an operation theatre of Germany or Japan all
> you have to do is to go to any one of the bulk traders of post consumer

> Hepatitis C or Tuberculosis. The rates vary with good infections fetching
> from Rs 100 to 150 per kg. You might be wondering what this is all about.
> Day in and day out we all talk about the lack of accountability in Pakistan.
> The authorities that are responsible for ensuring accountability are those
> working in connivance with plastic scrap traders of Lahore to ensure
> clearance of containers carrying thousands of tones of infection into our
> local market.

Although a strengthening and overhaul of customs law as well as more diligence
on control of such imports will prove useful. It is of utmost importance that
local communities get involved in keeping our country clean of such products.
For this purpose reporting such waste piles are key, too long have we been
exposed to harmful diseases due to lack of vigilance. The effort will require
us to not drive past burning heaps of open air rubbish in our city and stop to
ask why and who is exposing us to these hazardous materials. More can also be
achieved by organizing community cleaning drives and not restricting them to
beach fronts.

Only if we ourselves show care for the environment around us can we effect
change in keeping it safe and livable here in Pakistan.
