Created four years ago, the blog [Still Life in Moving
Vehicles](http://lifeinmovingvehicle.blogspot.com/) has been featuring a
variety of interesting photos of Bangkok taxi cab decorations. Dale Konstanz,
who started compiling the photos more than five years ago, cites his
inspiration for the online project

> I started taking photos inside Bangkok taxis almost 5 years ago and shortly
> thereafter a writer friend suggested that I start a blog as a way to archive
> my photographs and as a method to document my experiences in the cabs. Also,
> I thought it would be a good way to share my observations of Thai culture
> with friends and family, as well as other enthusiasts of Thai popular
> culture.

Dale [appreciates](http://lifeinmovingvehicle.blogspot.com/2008/03/safe-from-
harm.html) the value of the taxi charms and talismans especially their impact
on passengers and Bangkok residents

> I get off the skytrain and jump in a taxi and go to work. I put in my 8
> hours. Then, I get back into a taxi and head for home. 5 days a week. Sounds
> boring? Not if you're taking taxis in Bangkok.
>
> For me, it's not so much about the view outside. It's more about what's
> inside the taxis in Bangkok; the menagerie of gods, goddesses, deities, and
> monk statuettes, flowers, and other trinkets chosen for their ability to
> protect the driver and the car, and to assure that the driver has ample
> passengers. Like me.

Asked to name the pictures in his blog which best represent the uniqueness of
Bangkok taxis, Dale mentions the following

> 1\. Photo of a taxi filled with extensive collections of religious and
> superstitious objects, as well as other miscellaneous bits and bobs.
>
> 2\. Picture of a cab decked out with images of characters such as Hello
> Kitty, Tweety Bird, Doraemon, Winnie the Pooh, or The Hulk.
>
> 3\. Photo of a taxi with yan drawings created by Buddhist monks on the
> ceiling, steering wheel, or other parts of the carʼs interior. The drawings
> are supposed to help protect the driver, the car, and the passengers from
> accidents and ghostly spirits.
>
> 4\. Picture with objects that are believed to attract money. Such items
> include fish decorations made out of folded money, Buddha statues with torn
> loot suspended in resin, and miniature fish traps that are supposed to
> “catch” money inside.
>
> 5\. Picture of a taxi with images of the King and other Thai royalty from
> the past and present.
