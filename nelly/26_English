December 2011 post-election protest events consist of two elements:
‘professional oppositioners’ and concerned citizens. In Moscow those two
elements managed to get together to hold one of the most massive peaceful
manifestations in the history of the country. In St. Petersburg, however, the
meeting was let down by one of the parties. Citizens responded with confusion
and disdain.

**What change do protests bring?**

What has changed since December 5, 2011, when the first post-election protests
were held? Is there any sense in participating in protest demonstrations
organized by the opposition? These are the questions people were asking as the
day of another all-Russian meeting – December, 24 – was approaching (the
detailed map of meetings in Russian and foreign cities is
[here](http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/52861.html) [ru]).

Several organizations gave the following answer in their [Vkonakte
group](http://vkontakte.ru/wall-32803139_10816) [ru]:

> In his [address](http://www.gazeta.ru/news/seealso/2143754.shtml) to the
> Federal Assembly Medvedev proposed a “complex reform” of the political
> system (in comparison with the last year's address when he dedicated only
> three minutes to political issues). The proposal includes controlled
> regional governor elections, simplified registration of the political
> parties, single mandate constituencies…

Another achievement of the previous protests is that the Presidential Council
on Human Rights called for the dismissal of Vladimir Churov, head of Central
Election Committee.

No one can say which of these initiatives, if any, will be brought into effect
but we cannot deny one obvious fact that there has been a response from those
in power. It seems that the authorities expected post-election meetings and
protests to come to an end quite naturally as time passes and the tension
eases.

Some claim that the President's address to be nothing more but a handout for
citizens. Therefore, there are voices that call everyone still to take to the
streets until the goal – fair re-elections – has been achieved. The user

24 Moscow rally)

Medvedev has given us so many promises today. So now we won't go anywhere? For
real? Let’s just sit calmly and wait until he brings them into life.

**Protest in St. Petersburg: split by politicians**

In St. Petersburg opposition has split resulting in two separate meetings
instead of one, which were held with a difference of only one hour (one at
Pionerskaya Square and the other at Academic Saharov Square). According to the
official statements, the majority of the organizations including political
parties and movements during coordination meeting on December 22,
[voted](http://www.rusolidarnost.ru/novosti/glavnoe/2011-12-22-peterburgskie-
oppozitsionery-gotovyatsya-k-mitingu-24-dekabrya) [ru] against having
nationalists as participants in the forthcoming meeting due to the
provocations from them during the previous two meetings (on December 10th and
18th). In Moscow the danger of disrupting the demonstration was also quite
high, although the protesters [managed to reach a
consensus](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/23/russia-opposition-faces-
online-communication-problems/).

Another explanation for the break was that the opposition has been fighting
over power which none even possessed (illegally tapped conversations of Boris
Nemtsov [reflect the nature of
relations](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/22/russia-phone-hacking-
case-unites-opposition/) between opposition politicians). Due to the lack of
mutual trust, the demonstration failed to gather a lot of people who didn't
want to be played. The majority of the protesters do not belong to any party
but feel it necessary to defend their constitutional right to vote.

The rally at Pionerskaya Square started as planned at 1pm. People faced the
first confusing surprise of that day – the scene was decorated with the
emblems of just one party – A Just Russia, although the demonstration was
organized by many activist groups. Moreover their hymn played before and after
the meeting, making the whole demonstration look like their own creation.

Such monopolization of demonstration symbolics (beneficial to A Just Russia,
and particularly Sergey Mironov who will be running as a presidential
candidate in March 2012) evoked rejection and repudiation among the
participants. @dark_vovich
[exclaimed](https://twitter.com/#!/dark_vovich/status/150597693817880578)
[ru]:

Piter [St.Petersburg] has wimped out today’s meeting entirely…

And [added](https://twitter.com/#!/dark_vovich/status/150671965747810304)
[ru]:

A Just Russia is almost like United Russia. They have occupied the meeting in
Piter. Shame!

It seems that A Just Russia has ultimately put Petersburgers off going to
meetings.

This meeting gathered from 2,500 to 5000 participants, significantly less than
in Moscow. The protesters, however, are not discouraged. Moderators of

politicians who had jeopardized a citizen initiative:

> Мы выходим на улицы не потому что мы идем за вами, а потому что мы
> сознательные граждане, которые хотят, чтобы законы их страны соблюдались и
> чтобы выборы были честными. ЭТО НЕ ВЫ ВЫВОДИТЕ НАС НА УЛИЦЫ, ЭТО МЫ ВЫВОДИМ
> ВАС!

We go to the streets not because we follow you, but because we are responsible
citizens, who want the laws of their country to be obeyed and elections to be
honest. IT iIS NOT YOU WHO BRING US TO THE STREETS, BUT US WHO BRING YOU!
