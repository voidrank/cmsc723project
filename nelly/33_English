The number of foreign workers in Singapore continues to rise but little is
known about their working and housing conditions. Curious to know the stories
of migrant workers in prosperous Singapore, three interns conceptualized the
[‘Made by Migrants’](http://www.madebymigrants.com/) project and
[documented](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Made-by-
Migrants/186106531476916?sk=wall) the daily activities of construction workers
for two weeks

> Made by Migrants is a collaborative project undertaken by a group of interns
> from BBH Singapore. The project aims to look past the skin-deep perceptions
> of migrant workers by revealing their motivations, stories and dreams.
>
> Ian, one of the team’s members from Manchester will live and work with
> migrant construction workers on site for two weeks. He plans to [document
> his experience](https://twitter.com/#!/MadeByMigrants/) and those of the men
> around him to share with the outside world.

[Kirsten Han](http://seayouthsayso.com/made-by-migrants-%E2%80%93-stories-of-
construction-workers-in-singapore) interviewed the group and reviewed their
project

> It’s impossible not to cross paths with a migrant worker these days. We see
> them everywhere: fixing our roads, cutting the grass, clambering over
> construction sites. Everyone seems to have something to say about these
> workers, be it good or bad. They’ve been discussed in the context of
> economics, immigration and human rights. But who are these workers? What are
> their names? What did they used to do? Why have them come here, and who have
> they left behind?
>
> Made By Migrants is a project that seeks to, if not answer, at least shed a
> little light on these questions
>
> Through these stories we’re able to identify and relate to these workers and
> their motivations, and to realise that they are much more than rubber boots
> and fluorescent safety vests; they are people just like us, people with
> families and responsibilities and hopes.

An ordinary day for a construction worker

Below is a [video
interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=43_4JVGn7aw)
with a 22-year-old Chinese worker

Here is their interview with a [Thai
worker](http://www.madebymigrants.com/post/13917709687/i-have-lunch-with-
tatuporn-most-days-and-lately) in Singapore

> “Singapore so different from Thailand. Lots and lots of families piled high.
> Back home, I had my own lane, land and farm.”
>
> I ask him about his parents.
>
> “They were farmers and reasonably successful. But then we lost a lot of
> money and started to struggle. At the time, I was 16 and fit from working on
> the farm so I began competing in Muay Thai. For five years, I was a
> fighter.”
>
> “I lost everything, they want money. I did not have and I have to leave
> country. I stay in Singapore since and rarely seen my children. I enjoy
> Singapore, opportunity to work, I am thankful for, but here, it is money
> first, heart second. I can educate my children thanks to this work and hope
> the money I save can build a small chapel to help people who need it back
> home.”
