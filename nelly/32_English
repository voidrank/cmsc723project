A recent incident at a Lima shopping mall has turned a spotlight on the issue
of racism in Peru: Ricardo Apaza, an indigenous man from Cusco, was [treated
with disrespect](http://diariocorreo.pe/nota/55706/ricardo-apaza-cuenta-lo-
sucedido-en-uvk-larcomar/) [es] by the entrance guards of a movie theater, and
was not allowed to re-enter after going to the restroom.

This was reported [by some Twitter
users](https://twitter.com/#!/Pierina_Papi/status/144916277226512385) [es] and
quickly made the local news, generating different reactions from [public
officials](http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1346042/noticia-susana-baca-diceno-
discriminacion-y-pedira-investigacion-sobre-uvk), [es] [social media
users](http://sientemag.com/sobre-la-discriminacion-en-larcomar-y-el-racismo-
en-el-peru) [es], and [local and international
press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53OARUvzE0A) [es]. The movie theater was
[temporarily shut down](http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-1194-Miraflores-
closes-UVK-Larcomar-movie-theatre-/) by local authorities after the incident.

Why are so many people surprised with the racism shown in #Larcomar if you
find it everywhere? Enough talking, we need to act.

I'm really surprised to see that we still discriminate, that we still believe
that differences make some people better that others. It's a shame what
happened in the Larcomar movie theaters. It's appalling to see that when a
native Peruvian wears his outfit we sneer at him and may even discriminate
against him, but when a foreigner or a public figure wears the same typical
outfit “we feel proud”. And all this occurs despite the fact that we are
currently experiencing a boom of Peru and its diversity. That's why I think it
is important to recover the real value of our [history] and its real
protagonists.

Oh well!! Here in Peru racism is very strong! Hoooopefully someday it will
end, [# **yodudo**](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23yodudo "#yodudo")! [I
doubt it]. Hopefully, well, dreaming is free.

However, a few bloggers, like Carlos Quiroz of
[Peruanista](http://peruanista.blogspot.com/2011/12/caso-del-indigena-
discriminado-en.html) [es], wondered if this was a real case or some kind of
“smoke curtain” to distract Peruvians; but he did not question the fact that
the issue of racism in Peru is still very much alive:

> La verdadera **discriminación** ocurre en los Andes con **las mineras**
> asesinando nuestra gente y destruyendo el planeta, ocurre en las calles de
> Lima con tanta publicidad racista.

Real **discrimination** takes place in the Andes, with **mining companies**
killing our people and destroying the planet, and it also takes place in the
streets of Lima with so much racist advertising.

The issue of racism became very visible during the last presidential campaign,
especially [after the first electoral
round](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/12/peru-reactions-following-the-
first-2011-electoral-round/), when it became clear that Pedro Pablo Kuczinsky,
the “white” candidate, had not made it to the run-off, losing to the
“[Indian](http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/06/08/noticias/1307560178.html)”
[es] Ollanta Humala and the “Jap”, Keiko Fujimori. The polarization was
strikingly visible in tweets like this one by MiguelÁngel Cárdenas
([@Dragonrampante)](https://twitter.com/#!/dragonrampante/status/57198103568191488)
[es]:

> “Voy a pagarle la multa a mi empleada para que no vote por Ollanta”, le
> escucho a una ppkausa. Se merecen un Humala! pero nos friegan a todos.

“I'm going to pay my domestic worker's fine so that she doesn't vote for
Ollanta,” I heard a PPK-er [supporter of Kuczynski] say. They deserve Humala!
but they screw us all over.

Some of the most offensive posts, [like this
one](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2092014736879&set=o.202022556487434&type=3&theater)
[es], were quickly denounced by pages like [Vergüenza
Democrática](http://www.facebook.com/VerguenzaDemocratica) [es], which is also
currently covering this recent case of alleged racial discrimination.

Peru is certainly a multicultural country with a very complex racial
background (Spanish, Indian, African), and immigration (Asians, Europeans) has
added to this diversity. Centuries ago, during the Spanish Vice Royalty, the
dominant, Spanish/Creole elites [needed to clearly state their position of
privilege](http://autorepresentacion.blogspot.com/2008/09/racismo-en-el-
per.html) [es], so they established a sort of caste system, where everyone
knew “their proper place”. Reviewing some of Peruvian history, it is clear
that political power in Peru has been mostly in “white” hands, excluding
natives and other non-white people.

In Peru, “white” basically means non-indian, non-native, non-African, non-
colored. However, the real meaning of “white” (or “ _pituco”_ in slang) in
Peru is much more related to economic power and to social status than to DNA,
as BBC correspondent in Lima Dan Collyns
[explains](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10205171).

As Kelly explains in the blog [My Life in
Peru](http://mylifeinperu.com/2010/05/19/but-is-it-racism/):

> “…it's not the kind of racism I’ve seen in the US, where you see an actual
> hatred for those of another race. Here [in Peru], it’s more of a caste type
> system where it’s typically assumed by people in Peru that you have – or are

> Peruvians) are treated with more respect. And in the end, what’s the
> difference between that and any other type of racism?”

Despite the existence of anti-discrimination laws, including one specifically
addressed to fight [racial discrimination in the
media](http://blogs.ajws.org/blog/2011/07/19/peru-passes-law-against-racism-
in-the-media/#more-1547), racial discrimination in Peru [is evident in many
places](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/23/peruvians-the-preference-
for-afro-peruvians-at-funeral-services/), even in [public spaces, such as
beaches](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2007/01/31/peru-racism-at-the-
beach/)[](http://blogs.ajws.org/blog/2011/07/19/peru-passes-law-against-
racism-in-the-media/#more-1547). To mention just one example, a non-white
person may be not admitted into a discotheque in a fashionable neighborhood,
unless he or she is accompanied by a wealthy white person, or by a foreign
tourist. The excuses will most likely be: “we are already packed”, “we're
hosting a private event” or “admission is only for members”.

The blog [Estamos
Jodidos](http://estamosjodidos.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/cines-uvk-larcomar-y-
discriminacion/) (“We're Screwed”) [es] asks:

> En pleno siglo XXI ¿cómo es posible que sigamos siendo tan trogloditas e
> ignorantes para discriminar a las personas por su aspecto, origen,
> vestimenta o el motivo que sea?

We live in the 21th century; how can we be so primitive and ignorant to
discriminate against people based on their looks, origins, outfits or any
other reason?

The situation has also drawn the attention of [the Peruvian
Ombudsman](http://www.andina.com.pe/Espanol/noticia-defensoria-pide-a-
autoridades-y-ciudadanos-unirse-contra-discriminacion-390357.aspx) [es],
Eduardo Vega, whose office is currently [working on a strategy to fight racial
discrimination](http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/copy/Oxford%20Policy%20Conference/peruvian%20defensoria.pdf).
And things are slowly changing. Many still remember that in 2007[ an upmarket
restaurant, Cafe Del Mar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7odVLmx0Fs&) [es],
was [shut down for two
months](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_6281000/6281448.stm)
[es] and fined US $70,000 after denying admission to a mestizo couple.

However, more initiatives and policies (laws, educational campaigns, etc.) are
necessary to fight racism in Peru. The current government has to face many
unfinished tasks and challenges to make Peruvian society truly inclusive.
