**The right to life and non-discrimination**

[_Guatemala: Speaking Out on the Genocide of Indigenous
Women_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/22/guatemala-speaking-out-o-
the-genocide-of-indigenous-women/ "Guatemala Speaking out on the genocide of
indigenous women")

Thanks to activists the international courts following the genocide
proceedings against Guatemala will be taking into account the violence
indigenous women faced for more than 36 years where they were victims because
they were women and because they were indigenous.

A [documentary](http://vimeo.com/36268697) and several video testimonials tell
their harrowing stories, stories that due to the discrimination the victims
faced in their communities and the fear of retribution many kept silent for
decades.

**Fighting for sexual diversity**

[_Uganda: The Anti-Gay Bill That Won't Go
Away_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/16/uganda-the-anti-gay-bill-
that-wont-go-away/ https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/16/uganda-the-anti-
gay-bill-that-wont-go-away/  "Uganda, The Anti Gay Bill That Won't Go Away")

The same bill that was presented in 2009 is showing up again for voting in
Uganda:

> Uganda has again re-tabled the controversial anti-gay bill. Ugandan member
> of parliament, David Bahati, who proposed the bill back in 2009 has again
> considered tabling the draconian bill but with changes. He claims to have
> dropped the death penalty and jailing of family members who fail to report
> homosexuals to the authorities.

However, under further scrutiny it has been noted that no changes have been
made in the bill, and it is still exactly the same one presented back in 2009.
The[ following video ](http://youtu.be/2fuEsRJp2nU "Uganda anti gay bill")
explains the impact this bill will have on the LGBT community as well as their
families and friends:

in schools")

In Hong Kong, students in schools admit that homosexual students are bullied
and discriminated, so an organization has spearheaded a campaign to raise
awareness on this issue, focusing on producing online videos of interviews
with sexually diverse students and experts on the topic.

[_Spain: Crackdown Against Students Continues in
Valencia_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/21/spain-crackdown-against-

In Valencia, school children decided to protest budget cuts that affected
their schools, forcing them to carry blankets with them due to lack of
heating, in what has been a particularly cold winter in Europe. Police reacted
to the protests violently with students injured and detained; many videos have
been made showing the abuses against minors, females and the elderly.

[_Brazil: Quilombo Community in Bahia About to Be Evicted  
_](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/22/brazil-quilombo-community-in-
bahia-about-to-be-evicted/ "Brazil Quilombo Community in Bahia about to be
evicted")

> One of the oldest slave descendent communities in Brazil, Quilombo Rio dos
> Macacos, where around 50 families live, has a date for eviction: March 4,
> 2012. The claim for the land comes from the Navy of Brazil, that intends to

> Descendants of original peoples from Africa who, during colonialism, were
> taken from their land to become slaves in Brazil, the Quilombolas now see
> themselves under threat of losing their homes again, despite their right to
> the land they inhabit enshrined in the constitution.

[This short documentary](http://youtu.be/bwUXjUzqU6w "quilombo rio do macaco")

houses, unable to move freely and fearing for their well-being, their families
and their homes.

[_Brazil: The Deficient Prison Systems of the Americas_  
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/24/brazil-the-deficient-prison-
systems-of-the-americas/ "Brazil the deficient prison systems of the
americas")

Recent events in Latin American prisons that cost the life of hundreds of
inmates have people looking into the living situation and overcrowding faced
in many penitentiary centers, and analyzing if they are tragedies waiting to
happen. People who are being deprived of their liberty as punishment for their
crimes should be guaranteed minimum living conditions, and sometimes these
aren't met, as shown in the [documentary of life in Brazilian
prisons](http://youtu.be/PCuyk8MQIu4 "Trailer under the Brazilian Sun"), which
also provides possible solutions for this difficult situation.
