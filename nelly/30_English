Yemen's revolutionaries are not deterred nor did they give up on their demands
despite the signing of the strongly rejected [Gulf Cooperation Council's
initiative](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/25/yemen-mixed-reactions-
as-saleh-finally-signs-gcc-deal/) proposed in April and finally signed by
Saleh on November 23rd, providing a so called mechanism for him to
“relinquish” power. They went out on a 264km march on foot from the city of
Taiz in the south to the capital Sanaa in the north to send a message to the
world, the UN, US, the GCC and Saleh that they reject the newly formed unity
government and are determined to demand that Saleh, who was granted immunity
from prosecution for his involvement in an 11-month crackdown on protesters
demanding democracy, gets punished for his crimes.

tweets how the martyrs are never forgotten:

> #LifeMarch #Taiz2Sanaa ppl r marchin on a distance of 260km 4 tell da world
> they can't forget their martyrs as #GCCdeal & Saleh wants #Yemen

James Gurdan points in his blog [The
Trench](http://hadalzone.blogspot.com/2011/12/yemenis-march-to-energize-
their.html) the protesters’ view:

> “These GCC states are not at all competent to deal with popular requests for
> liberty and freedom, not to mention democratic government, because they
> themselves are mostly despotic regimes,” observed Yemen’s Coordinating
> Council of the Youth Revolution of Change (CCYRC). “They themselves would
> never welcome such requests from their own people, let alone be ready to
> accommodate such demands by people in neighboring states.”

The march includes men, women and even a few handicapped, reportedly seems to
have started with 700 men and 18 women. It left Taiz on foot on December 20th
and passed by many villages and towns. Along the way, the marchers were
greeted by fireworks and cheered by chants, welcomed and offered shelter and
food and joined in each city by protesters on their way to Sanaa, swelling
their numbers.

The procession also includes a kitchen and medical unit. However, generous
banquets of breakfasts, lunches and dinners were offered in each city they
stopped in, as shown in this video, also posted by Almobdieen:

The impressive march and powerful chants on the outskirts of the city of
Dhamar, half way en route to Sanaa from Taiz, shows the resilience and power
of the people. This feeling is captured in this video posted by

The people of Yemen proved to be people of resilience and steadfastness and
keep impressing the world with their civil peaceful resistance in their
struggle for freedom, democracy and building a new Yemen.

As impressive as the march has been yet there has been a disappointing and
evident lack of media coverage to the historic 264km Life March, which is the
longest since Mahatma Gandhi's[ Salt March](http://www.answers.com/topic/salt-
march-2) in 1930 which was 390km long.

Yemeni are heroically writing their own history and are making sure that the
world gets to see it while it is written despite the mainstream media blackout
throughout the revolution, with the use of social media, such as blogs,
Facebook, YouTube, Storify and, of course, Twitter.

After four days of walking a route full of steep mountain paths and difficult
curves, a usually dangerous drive by car, the march of tens od thousands
finally reached Sanaa today, December 24th. (video posted by:
[FreeDomTaiz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUt6tve9IAo))  
  
The protesters were greeted with chants from the people of the capital and
with security forces’ heavy tear gas and live bullets who tried to disperse
and stall their procession from reaching Change square. A number of deaths,
the first victim a woman shot in the head, and some serious injuries were
reported and the numbers keept increasing reaching 13 deaths by the end of the
day.

[@NajlaMo](https://twitter.com/#!/NajlaMo/status/150559660817125377) tweeted:

> So far 2 killed and several wounded, some are trapped and some are

[@wsaqaf](https://twitter.com/#!/wsaqaf/status/150555186803384320) wonders
until when will the world turn a blind eye on Yemen:

> At least 2 protesters in #Yemen's #LifeMarch killed today by Saleh forces &
> world remains silent

The march pumped life into Yemen's ongoing revolution and gave many Yemeni
lots of hope and pride. It is a fine example of passive resistance and of
Yemeni resilience and steadfastness.
