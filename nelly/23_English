Citizen journalist Bladimir Sánchez has already received threats for [making a
video ](http://youtu.be/BFv4HG8ALeA "video of evictions in Huila
Colombia")showing the forced evictions of farmers and fishermen protesting the
construction of a hydroelectric dam in the department of Huila, Colombia on
February 14 and 15. In less than three days, more than 600,000 people have
watched it.

On [Publimetro](http://www.publimetro.co/lo-ultimo/amenazan-a-realizador-de-
el-video-que-el-gobierno-colombiano-no-quiere-que-
veamos/lmklbw!n21SetShWI0c/?stop_mobi=yes) [es], Camilo Andrés García Cortés
states that the video may be making history as the most watched Colombian
citizen video, due to its half a million views during only two days. _[The
Video the Colombian Government Doesn't Want Us to
See](http://youtu.be/BFv4HG8ALeA "el video que el gobierno colombiano no
quiere que veamos") _[es] shows the violent eviction faced by two river bank
communities standing up peacefully against the building of the dam, and pulls
together the testimonies of those who faced the violence and were injured.

The communities are against the dam construction because it will leave them
without livelihoods if the river is diverted for the project. When describing
the clash that injured protesters, both the community members and journalists
present describe that there was no violence towards the authorities in spite
of the attacks, and that the police restricted the access of journalists,
peace observers and human right organizations to the area of the protest.

> La acción violenta se cumplió coordinadamente entre el Gobierno Nacional y
> Emgesa contra campesinos y pescadores inermes cuya única respuesta fue
> cogerse solidariamente de las manos para abrazar el río Magdalena o lanzarse
> al mismo, mientras recibían cargas de gases lacrimógenos y granadas de
> aturdimiento, ocasionando varios heridos, entre ellos, el obrero de
> construcción Luis Carlos Trujillo Obregón quien perdió su ojo derecho.

The violent action was accomplished in coordination between the National
Government and Emgesa [Ed.Note. Private Company granted the concession for the
hydroelectric dam] against unarmed farmers and fishermen whose only response
was to hold each other by the hands to hug the Magdalena River or jump into it
as they were buffeted by tear gas and stun grenades, causing several injuries
including the ones on construction worker Luis Carlos Trujillo Obregón who
lost his right eye.

On the [interview with Publimetro ](http://www.publimetro.co/lo-
ultimo/amenazan-a-realizador-de-el-video-que-el-gobierno-colombiano-no-quiere-
que-veamos/lmklbw!n21SetShWI0c/ "Bladimir's interview") [es] Bladimir
discussed the threats he's received:

> Recibí una llamada No aparece el número de la persona en el identificador
> (…) Me han enviado mensajes a mi correo. Me dicen que soy de las Farc, del
> ELN, que estoy atacando a la fuerza pública. Yo no soy nada de eso.
> Simplemente soy un realizador audiovisual que quiere mostrar la realidad de
> lo que pasa en el departamento del Huila.

I received a call, the number doesn't show up on the call identifier (-) I've
been sent messages to my mail. They say that I belong to the FARC, the ELN,
that I am attacking the public police force. I am none of that. I am simply a
videographer that wants to show the reality of what is happening in the
department of Huila.

calls, one including death threats.
