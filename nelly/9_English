The United States has recently [expanded its campaign of drone
strikes](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/human_nature/2012/04/yemen_s_drone_war_is_mission_creep_drawing_us_into_a_civil_war_.html)
in Yemen, to widespread anger and concern.

Drone strikes against suspected Al Qaeda operatives have been launched under
expanded authority allowing the CIA and military to fire [based only on the
targets’ intelligence
“signatures”](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-
house-approves-broader-yemen-drone-campaign/2012/04/25/gIQA82U6hT_story.html)
or patterns of behaviour, without knowing their identity.

Ibrahim Mothana, a Yemeni writer and activist, commented on the drone policy:

> Expanding drones program is not in the interest of #Yemen nor the US. It

Jeb Boone, an American journalist and former managing editor of the Yemen
Times, said:

The drones have been striking targets in the south of Yemen, and researcher
Atiaf Alwazir commented:

[Jeremy Scahill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Scahill), an award-
winning American investigative journalist, has [argued
against](http://www.thenation.com/article/166265/washingtons-war-yemen-
backfires) the use of drones in Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia. He recently made
a documentary for Al Jazeera English entitled [“America's Dangerous
Game”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eZ1x_qRAQ), which asks if the US is
creating more enemies than it can capture or kill.

According to the organizers of the recent [“Drone
Summit”](http://codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=6092) held in Washington on
April 28-29, as many as [3,000
people](http://www.codepinkalert.org/article.php?id=6065), including hundreds
of noncombatants, have been killed in drone strikes. This
[Storify](http://storify.com/noonarabia/a-storify-us-policy-and-drones-
strikes-in-yemen) collects some of the tweets from the summit regarding drone
strikes and US policy in Yemen. Jeremy Scahill's speech at the summit can be
seen [here](http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/04/29/obamas-death-panels-
jeremy-scahill-at-the-drone-summit-video/).

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism based at City University, London, has
published [figures for US covert action in
Yemen](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/):

> US Covert Action in Yemen 2001-2012
>
> Total US strikes: 41 – 132  
>  Total US drone strikes: 31 – 68  
>  Total reported killed: 294 – 673  
>  Civilians reported killed: 55 – 105  
>  Children reported killed: 24

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has also collated [detailed
data](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/03/29/yemen-reported-us-
covert-actions-since-2001/) on reported US covert actions in Yemen since 2001.

On April 30 [John Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O._Brennan),
chief counterterrorism advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama, gave a speech
entitled [“The Ethics and Efficacy of the President’s Counterterrorism
Strategy”](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-efficacy-and-ethics-us-
counterterrorism-strategy) in which he defended the use of drones. Activist
[Medea Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_Benjamin) challenged him
and spoke up against drone killings in Pakistan, Yemen and other countries, as
shown in [this video](http://youtu.be/ReAU6oTr0OY):

In a post entitled [“A brave lady Speaks out about the CIA Drone
Strikes”](http://afrahnasser.blogspot.de/2012/05/brave-lady-speaks-out-about-
cia-drone.html), Yemeni blogger Afrah Nasser commended Medea Benjamin's
courage and quoted her words:

> “What about of the hundreds innocent people killing with our drone strikes
> in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia? I speak out on behave of those innocent
> victims. They deserve an apology from you, Brennan. How many people are you
> willing to sacrifice? Why are you lying to the American people and not
> saying how many people have been killed? …. Shame on you!”

As I said in a recent blog post,[“The Failed US Policy in
Yemen”](http://notesbynoon.blogspot.com/2012/03/us-failed-policy-in-
yemen.html):

> The use of drones on Yemeni soil to kill “suspected” al Qaeda leaders, the
> unjustified killing of a teenager and many other innocent civilians commonly
> referred to as “collateral damage” and the illegal detention of a
> journalist, has fostered more animosity towards the US. […] The US clearly
> needs to re-evaluate its counter-terrorism policy in Yemen by addressing the
> socio-economic underlying causes that produce terror, rather than focusing
> its aid solely in the fight against al “Qaeda” and continuing with the drone
> attacks which kills innocent people, alienates, angers and aggravates the
> general Yemeni public, giving extremists a motive to join militant groups.
