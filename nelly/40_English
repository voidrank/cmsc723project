Earlier this week Kazakhstani internet users began to observe a curious
phenomenon. Since recently, Google.kz now redirects to the main Google.com
website with [a Kazakh language interface](http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=kk).
This has been a nuisance for those who use Google Search engine via _Chrome_
browser, because every time they try a search, the blank Kazakhified start
page of the main site appears.

Google's Bill Karan, senior vice-president and chief of search infrastructure
department, [explains](http://googlerussiablog.blogspot.com/2011/06/blog-
post_08.html "поясняет") in the company's official blog [ru]:

> A month ago the Kazakh center of network information informed us about the
> decree of the Ministry of communication and information of Kazakhstan.
> According to the document, all domain names in .kz zone, including
> [google.kz](http://google.kz/), must physically reside on servers inside the
> country… Therefore, we have made a decision to redirect visitors from
> [google.kz](http://google.kz/) to [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)
> in Kazakh language.

traffic in Kazakhstan on the whole [ru]:

But _yerden_ has a [completely different
opinion](http://yvision.kz/community/Интернет%20в%20Казахстане/166115.html
"другая точка зрения"). He welcomes such decision, as he believes that the
Kazakhstani sector of internet should be legally regulated [ru]:

> Settling the [Google] servers on the territory of Kazakhstan shall stimulate
> the development of internet in Kazakhstan. The .kz domain name is associated
> with Kazakhstan and its sites have local audience. So, we must build our own
> infrastructure and data centers, create jobs and raise taxes here, in
> Kazakhstan.
