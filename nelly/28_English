The violence and impunity Mexico has been facing these past years have
prompted artists, creators and media to join forces and launch a campaign to
change statistics into names and stories. Through a collaborative project they
are asking viewers to research other casualties and give voices to the victims
of violence.

Artists have recorded several videos telling some of the stories of people who
were murdered in Mexico. For example, singer Ely Guerra recorded herself
speaking as Marisela Escobedo, a mother who fought to see justice for her
daughter's death. Although her daughter's husband confessed to killing his
wife, the authorities declared that there wasn't enough evidence.

After she managed to get him to trial once again, he was declared innocent a
second time. Marisela Escobedo was murdered in front of the Justice Palace,
where she was protesting and rallying for justice for her daughter. Both
Marisela and her daughter's murders are still unpunished.

Leonardo Amador Rivas worked in the News Divine disco where he lost his live
on June 20th 2008 along with 11 other young men. A police operation in the
place, without any organization, acting negligently and ruled by the
criminalizing of these young men, ended their lives.

Piro Pendas (Ritmo Peligroso), Mexican musician, gives voice to Leonardo's
story, which is the story of our country.

Fifteen year old Victoria Castro from El Salvador was one of 72 migrants
massacred in Mexico while trying to get to the United States. [She tells her
story through Diana García](http://youtu.be/6-mGO-Tn480), a Mexican actress.

A call for citizen videos has been made through social network
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/187192801355821/), hoping that
viewers will take the time to research the story of one of the victims of
violence and tell their story. All videos end with a commentary on how these
crimes are only possible through the lawlessness and corruption of the Mexican
State and urge their country to wake up. There is no deadline for the videos,
since it is an [ongoing
project.](http://contingentegdl.blogspot.com/2011/10/nuestras-vidas-nuestros-
nombres.html)

> Los invitamos a participar en un video colectivo que pretende darle voz y

We invite you to participate in a collective video that means to give life and
voice to those who lost them in hands of the war against drug trafficking,
impunity and corruption, in the hands of the violence we live through
currently in our country. The names are changed into numbers and this
distances us from the tragedy. Each victim has a name, and behind the name is
a life, a story, a family. The tragedy is ours, not someone else's.

[Carlo Avilés gives voice to Juan Carlos
Medrano](http://youtu.be/u2OHlfMsxNA), who when celebrating the triumph of his
basketball team was murdered when an armed group arrived at the house were
they were celebrating and started shooting. His best friend carried him to the
hospital, but he didn't recover and died 48 hours after. Fourteen other youth
were killed and about 20 others injured. All of them were between 15 and 20
years old.

the project:

Using tools such as [**YouTube**](http://www.youtube.com/user/NVidasNNombres)
and social networks to create viral phenomena, “ _Our Lives, Our Names”_ hopes
to generate a collective consciousness regarding the tragedies lived daily in
our country. Violence is not only something we see in the media, violence
starts in the homes and from there is where we must start the process of
generating an anti-violence culture.
