During the last years of socialist
[Czechoslovakia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia), there was a
typical lack of goods in the country. It's not that people were going hungry
or naked, it was still possible to buy basic things. But if you wanted
something a bit more special – say, a pair of jeans – you had to go to
[special shops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuzex) and pay with special
vouchers, which ordinary people could only acquire at the black market.

Shopkeepers kept tropical fruit or better cuts of meat under the counter for
the customers they deemed more valuable, such as doctors and specialist
mechanics. Most other people had to stand in long lines. Buying a new car or a
new flat used to take years of waiting. Western brands – with the exception of
soda, perhaps – were very rare.

**Shopping revolution**

The situation changed after [the revolutionary year of
1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Czechoslovakia_\(1989–1992\)),
when the borders opened and nearby agricultural villages in western Austria
turned into shopping centers – and they remain so even today, when
international brands and stores are now strong players in the Slovak market.

Often, however, food products of the same brand differ in quality and price,
depending on whether they are produced for consumers in Western Europe or
those in Central and Eastern Europe.

Even though customers might expect products of the same brand to be of the
same quality worldwide, regional differences do exist, according to [a
study](http://www.euractiv.sk/fileadmin/images/TK_test_znackovych_potravin_final.ppt)
[sk, .ppt file] sponsored by the Slovak department of the European Commission
and carried out by the Association of Slovak Consumers.

Of the products tested during the study, the quality of Milka Alpine Milk
chocolate turned out to be the most consistent: there was no significant
difference discovered between versions produced in Western Europe and in
Poland. German and Austrian customers however, are guaranteed to get chocolate
made of milk from the Alps mountains. [The famous purple
cow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milka) that supplies milk for Eastern
Europeans’ chocolate may live somewhere in the [Tatra
Mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_Mountains), a fact about which
they would not be made aware.

**Regional differences**

In the case of Coca-Cola, the difference is the kind of sugar used. German as
well as Czech consumers will get a version with beet sugar, while the nations
further east have corn sugar in their drinks. The company
[explained](http://ekonomika.sme.sk/c/5843781/nasa-coca-cola-je-trochu-ina-
ako-ceska-a-nemecka.html) [sk] that this way they can supply a cheaper product
for the Slovak market – and when you compare Coca-Cola's price table in the
study, you can see that it is true.

Blogger _Tibor Pospíšil_
[wrote](http://pospisil.blog.sme.sk/c/261797/Skandalozne-zistenia-Asociacie-
spotrebitelov.html) [sk] that beet sugar is more expensive in Europe because
of the “sugar lobby” and, for most customers, there is no significant
difference in quality. What's more, this way Slovak customers get original
American-quality Coca-Cola.

There was visible difference in Nescafé Gold coffee for Western and Eastern
Europe – due to different preferences of local customers, [according to the
manufacturer](http://www.euractiv.sk/podnikanie-v-eu/clanok/su-v-novych-
clenskych-krajinach-nekvalitnejsie-potraviny-016936) [sk].

But the biggest differences were found in spice products from Kotányi, an
Austria-based company. Customers across Europe are getting similarly-sized
packs with different amounts of spice inside and very different pricing per
kilogram. Even though everything is produced at one factory, the worst quality
was found in a package produced for Bulgaria: nearly 10 percent of its
contents was just powder, and in the case of red pepper, a significant part of
its natural color was missing. The company's spokesperson
[said](http://www.euractiv.sk/podnikanie-v-eu/clanok/su-v-novych-clenskych-
krajinach-nekvalitnejsie-potraviny-016936) [sk] it had happened accidentally,
and, to support this view, it should be noted that packs produced for the
Austrian, as well as Hungarian and Slovak, markets had problems with humidity
levels.

results](http://ekonomika.sme.sk/c/5842865/znackove-potraviny-su-v-nemecku-
kvalitnejsie-ako-u-nas.html) [sk], published in April 2011 in the Economy
section of _SME.sk_ online news portal.
