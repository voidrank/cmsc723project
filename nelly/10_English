As the the world struggles with the global economic crisis, Morocco's
[Mawazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawazine) festival [may be
affected](http://www.magharib.com/node/23315) [ar] by growing resentment at
its cost. Mawazine is an annual international music festival held in the
Moroccan capital Rabat, which in 2012 will take place [between 18 and 26
May](http://www.festivalmawazine.ma/) [fr].

In the past international stars including the late [Whitney
Houston](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/13/arab-world-rip-whitney-
houston/) have performed at Mawazine, and tourists flock to watch the
concerts. The opposition to the festival is not new; last year, activists
[pushed for the
cancellation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/17/morocco-controversy-
over-international-music-festival/) of Mawazine but failed. Protesters say the
festival is a [squandering of public
money](http://moroccoworldnews.com/2012/02/27410/mariah-careys-pay-for-
mawazine-festival-stirs-controversy/), demanding that its lavish budget should
be invested in more pressing issues, but organisers argue that the main part
of the budget comes from sponsorship and ticket sales. As the festival draws
near, there are growing concerns that protests may break out.

University teacher Talal wrote in a [blog

“Mawazine ou Mahazine” meaning “Mawazine (rhythms) or sorrowful people”:

I would like to be able to share this happiness with our patients who are
dying in the emergency rooms waiting for a nurse to come, after six hours of
waiting. I would really like to share this happiness with the poor law
graduate who commits three spelling mistakes in each sentence due to the
broken education system with which he grew up, or with the young girl who has
to walk four hours to get to school. I would like to share it, this happiness
which you [El Habib Choubani, Moroccan minister] talk about, with the
residents of the Atlas mountains who die of cold becuse of a slightly too
harsh winter and miserable living conditions, with neither electricity nor
drinking water.

The festival is sensitive political issue. Marketing manager Insouciant
tweeted [fr]:

> [@yucefj](http://twitter.com/yucefj/status/190205665002790913): Benkirane
> ordonne la chabiba du ~~#~~ PJD de ne pas se manifester contre ~~#~~
> Mawazine…Vive l´expression libre quoi!!

Benkirane [Morocco's prime minister] orders the youth of ~~#~~ PJD [Justice
and Development Party] not to protest against ~~#~~ Mawazine… So much for
freedom of expression!!

As opposition grows, the music festival [seeks to become financially
independent](http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2012/03/30/feature-03)
to counter the criticisms. Safae El Mansouri argued:

>
> [@safaemansouri](https://twitter.com/#!/safaemansouri/statuses/62493707647197185):
> Mawazine funds: 57% SMS games, TV broadcasting ads, 34% #sponsorship, 8%
> from #Moroccangovernment. STOP blaming #Government for #MAWAZINE.

The following video [ar] by the [National Campaign for the Cancellation of
Mawazine](http://www.facebook.com/antimawazine) documents the year-long
efforts to get the festival cancelled:
