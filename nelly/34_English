Rwandan President [Paul Kagame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame) is
comfortable with the debate on whether the country's constitution should be
amended to allow him to run for a third term. Speaking at a press conference
in Kampala, Uganda, where he had flown as the guest of honor for a local youth
event, he [argued that ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RECVX2SnbpY)the
Rwandan citizens are free to say they don't want him, but they are also free
to say that they want him.

The Rwandan leader is widely credited for having put an end to the [1994
genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocid) that killed over
800,000 people. In recent years, human rights organizations have raised
concerns over the country's

Rwandans activists campaigning for democracy were[ “chilled to the bone” by
this announcement](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kagame-puts-
down-marker-for-third-term-6276163.html). The activists believe that President
Kagame is pursuing a third term as a strategy to shield himself from future
prosecution. In particular, they identify the recently released [United
Nations Mapping
report](http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2010/10/un_mapping_report) that
accuses him of war crimes against members of the Hutu ethnic group. The same
report emphasized that the crimes could amount to genocide if proven in a
court of law.

Analysts are also alarmed that this decision to seek another term could
destabilize the Great Lakes region by leaving no option open to the Rwandan
opposition other than to take up arms.

The presidential term limits debate in Rwanda is championed by internal
security minister, Sheikh Musa Fazil Harerimana. Sheikh Fazil is also
campaigning for the legal recognition of polygamous marriages, which are
currently outlawed. President Kagame [seems to
agree](http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Rwandas-Kagame-keen-on-3rd-term-
talk-20111212) with the Sheikh Fazil:

> This Sheikh has a right to express himself and it's as if people expect me
> to go to this person and say ‘you shut up. Don't talk about this anymore.’
> No. This is not my business.

On Twitter, Ugandan journalist Timothy Kalyegira scoffed at the decision with
an accompanying dose of satire:

>
> [@TimKalyegira](http://twitter.com/#!/TimKalyegira/status/146150549488807936):
> Thousands of tearful Rwandans will soon start narrating to world media how
> betrayed they will feel if Kagame does not seek a third term.

British journalist Ian Birell was equally unimpressed:

> [@ianbirell](http://twitter.com/#!/ianbirrell/status/146152700244008960):
> People are free to say they want me to be president again, says Kagame.
> They're not free, of course, to say he should go…

But Ian Birell's comments immediately attracted the wrath of the Rwandan
ambassador to the United Kingdom, Erneste Rwamucyo, who accused him of western
paternalism:

>
> [@ErnestRwamucyo](http://twitter.com/#!/ErnestRwamucyo/status/146181506006650880):
> This paternalism and ‘know it all attitude’ on Africa and African leaders is
> not good. A pple out to be respected.

To which Mr. Birell responded:

> [@ianbirell](http://twitter.com/#!/ianbirrell/status/146185127595220992):
> There is nothing paternalistic about supporting human rights and opposing
> repressive & despotic regimes

As the debate raged on, a heated exchange involving several Ugandan
journalists ensued. It all started when [Bob
Muheebwa](http://twitter.com/tijo5) asked whether there were other Ugandan
journalists apart from [Andrew Mwenda ](http://twitter.com/AndrewMwenda)and
[Alan Kasuja ](http://twitter.com/kasujja)interested in interviewing President
Kagame. The journalists wondered why Mwenda and Kasuja are never critical of
President Kagame in their writings.

George Bankole's answer was more blunt. In an apparent reference to both
journalists, Mwenda and Kasujja, he said:

> [@Snottyganda](http://twitter.com/#!/Snottyganda/status/146544727209152513):
> @tijo5 Cos both hve been compromised with Cash incentives
> @mugumya@TimKalyegira@Gilespies@AndrewMwenda@kasujja

Giles Muhame, managing editor for the Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone, seemed
to agree:

> [@Gilespies](http://twitter.com/#!/Gilespies/status/146550594121900032):
> @Snottyganda What else can i add?
> @tijo5@mugumya@TimKalyegira@AndrewMwenda@kasujja

So did journalist Timothy Kalyegira:

>
> [@TimKalyegira](http://twitter.com/#!/TimKalyegira/status/146545190910435328):
> @Snottyganda@tijo5@mugumya@AndrewMwenda@kasujja Others compromised by the
> sheer flattery of being on casual terms with a head of state.

Andrew Mwenda maintained silence on the issue, but Allan Kasujja later denied
the allegations:

> [@kasujja](https://twitter.com/#!/kasujja/status/146601281727889408):
> @TimKalyegira @tijo5 @mugumya @AndrewMwenda I am amazed at how simplistic
> your arguments have become. Can't my motivation be justice?

Again, Timothy Kalyegira responded:

>
> [@TimKalyegira](http://twitter.com/#%21/TimKalyegira/status/146629215419240449):
> @kasujja It can be justice. We just find it interesting, this parade of
> Ugandan journalists singing Kagame's praises.

Rwanda currently has a constitutional two term limits for the presidency. Each
term is composed of a total of seven years, which is the longest single term
in Africa. President Kagame officially assumed office in 2000 although many
believe he has technically been in power since the 1994 genocide.
