Every year around the world, [International Women's
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day) (IWD) is
celebrated on March 8. Hundreds of events occur not just on this day but
throughout March to mark the economic, political and social achievements of
women.

Ghana and her women were not left out of this important day. A series of
events took place which lead to [bloggers](http://ghanablogging.com) and civil
society organizations in Ghana express their opinions/comments about them
online.

The Ghanaian [Ministry of Women and Children's
Affairs](http://www.mowacghana.net/) mandated that the Day should be
commemorated with the Ghana Women of Excellence Awards Scheme which saw the
First Lady Ernestina Naadu Mills been the Guest of Honour.

The theme of the Awards Scheme was **_“Empowering the Ghanaian Woman for
National Development_** ”. The Award Scheme aims at motivating Ghanaian women
to strive for excellence in their various walks of life and to take their
rightful place in the national development process. The scheme formed part of
the celebration of International Women's Day and the 1st Awards ceremony was
held at the [Accra International Conference
Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra_International_Conference_Centre
"Accra International Conference Centre") yesterday, 8th March 2011.

Ato-Ulzen Appiah, author of “[The Vim Views & Versions – Blogs of a MIghTy
African](http://mightyafrican.blogspot.com/2011/03/first-ever-ghana-women-of-
excellence.html)” blog wrote a well detailed post about the ceremony which saw
Dorothy Gordon, Director of [Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in
ICT](http://www.aiti-kace.com.gh/) been honored for her role in ICT
development in Ghana.

[Edward Amartey-Tagoe](http://twitter.com/ttaaggooee) interviewed Farida
Bedwei, the author of “[Definition of a
Miracle](http://caribbeanbookblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/definition-of-a-
miracle-by-farida-bedwei/)” as his [International Women’s Day
contribution](http://tagoeblogger.blogspot.com/2011/03/farida-bedwei-my-pick-
for-international.html) article:

> Farida got diagnosed with [cerebral
> palsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy) and in a community where
> people suffering from this disease are routinely misunderstood and viewed as
> incapable of contributing meaningfully to the society; Edward decided to
> feature her by way of seeking answers to some questions from her.

This is part of the interview:

> 1\. What has been your biggest dream?  
>  My biggest dream as a writer is to win a Booker and a Pultzier. My biggest
> dream as a software engineer/ entrepreneur is to head the first Fortune 100
> company in Ghana. My biggest dream as a Ghanaian woman with a disability is
> be able to change perceptions on disability in Ghana and Africa.
>
> 2\. Would you describe yourself as a writer or as a programmer?  
>  I would describe myself as a Software engineer with a natural flair for
> writing.
>
> 3\. What is your book about and what motivated you to write it  
>  The book is about contemporary Ghanaian society through the eyes of a
> disabled little girl. I wrote this book to change perceptions; perceptions
> about those of us in Ghana, Africa and other third world developing
> countries and, perceptions about persons with disabilities. We are much more
> than AIDS, Child-Soldiers, Hunger and Corruption and it is about time we
> made this known to all. It is time we told our own stories and changed the
> image the rest of the world has of our beautiful continent.
