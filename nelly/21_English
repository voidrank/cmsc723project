Once fashionable and popular, planking has been eclipsed by a new sensation
that has gripped many Filipinos around the globe. Planking was last year’s
standard pose in youth and student protests against education budget cuts.
Noynoying is the [new
planking](http://www.anakbayan.org/%E2%80%98noynoying%E2%80%99-becomes-
overnight-sensation-while-palace-remains-mum-on-oil-overpricing) in the
Philippines.

Introduced in response to the President Noynoy Aquino regime’s inaction on oil
price hikes, Noynoying is derived from the root word Noynoy, the nickname of
Philippine President Benigno Aquino III. It is described as “doing nothing
when in fact you have something to do.”

The pose first hit the public in last Thursday's (15 March) anti-oil price
hike protest after government [officials threatened to arrest those who will
do
planking](http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=65&articleid=786873)
during the protest actions. Despite efforts by the Palace to [shrug off
noynoying](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/162355/palace-
on-%E2%80%98noynoying%E2%80%99-creative-but-no-effect) by saying it won’t have
any effect on the public, it has in fact now gone viral online.

Noynoying Twitter Trends

It has inspired a [Facebook fan page](https://www.facebook.com/Noynoying2012)
which gained over 800 likes in a day and various internet memes. The hashtag
#noynoying, [Chantal’s
Doodle](https://www.chantaleco.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/noynoying/) points
out, was top nine in the Philippines trends in Twitter the day the pose came
out in public.

To counter the notion that the President is not doing anything on people’s
concerns, the Philippine government Official Gazette [released a
photo](https://twitter.com/govph/statuses/180233932112015360) of the President
supposedly busy at work:

![](https://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Noynoying-
Failed-Photo-Shoot.jpg)But netizens like the
[Momblogger](http://blogwatch.tv/2012/03/noynoying-introduced-on-the-day-of-
rage-vs-oil-price-hikes/) has pointed out discrepancies, like the presence of
TV and DVD remote controls, in one of the photos supposedly showing the
president at “work.”

Freedomwall.net user [Ian](http://www.freedomwall.net/2012/03/noynoying-
portraying-the-presidents-idle-gestures/) points out that President Noynoy has
no one to blame for the growing popularity of noynoying but himself:

> Portrayal of Noynoying made me remember the not so distant past. Partying
> while half of the nation is being ravaged by Sendong and reacted only when
> the public noticed of such inaction was making him the push-button
> president. He is the man who had written or worked the least while he was
> still in the Congress or the Senate. Being a chain smoker is not a good
> example and making a promise to stop when he’ll win the presidency but then
> finally broke it is a worst one.

Blogger Pat Mangubat of the New Philippine Revolution describes noynoying as
the [new form of
governance](http://newphilrevolution.blogspot.com/2012/03/noynoying-new-form-
of-governance.html):

> What better way to describe what this government is doing than parody the
> very popular photo of Noynoy in a pensive mood? That photo, which was used
> during the 2010 elections, became somewhat a symbol, an attraction if you
> wish, to convince the middle classes that Pnoy is the “one”, a some sort of
> Pinoy Obama, who has the skills and the wherewithal to push this country
> into progress. Now, two years and a half into office, and nothing seems to
> move at all, except perhaps the cash registers of Big Business who is now
> cashing in on the somewhat catatonic state of this government.

[@gangbadoy:](https://twitter.com/#!/gangbadoy/status/180562732494491648)
That's funny, with us “Noynoying is a verb that means “always dating but not
proceeding with marriage”

The youth activist group [Anakbayan ](http://www.anakbayan.org)has released a
guide on “How to Do the NOYNOYING” and called for more pressure on the Aquino
government to act on people’s issues like the oil price hike.

How to do The NOYNOYING:  
1\. Get a group of people  
2\. Find a busy public space  
3\. Sit down/lie on the floor and act like you're doing nothing, lazy, stupid,
and like Noynoy  
4\. Take a picture or video and post in Twiter using #noynoying, or upload and
post at facebook.com/Noynoying2012

Here's one of the noynoying memes making the rounds online:
