A week ago, a [Saudi mother drove
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/17/saudi-arabia-a-woman-challenges-
the-law-by-driving-in-jeddah/)her car in Jeddah to take her kids to their
school. On May 22, 2011, another Saudi woman, [Manal Al-
Sharif](http://twitter.com/#!/manalalsharif), drove her car with the famous
Saudi women rights activist Wajeeha Al-Huwaider sat beside her and her brother
and son in the back seats. The day before, Al-Sharif had [posted a video of
herself driving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT-3I5jg1xg) on YouTube.

Manal Al-Sharif was arrested, then released on bail, but later on the police
arrested her from her house at midnight once again.

Twitter has been awash with netizens writing about this new heroine, whom some
have described as another [Rosa
Parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks) (a famous activist of the
African American civil rights movement).

Famous Egyptian columnist and activist Mona ElTahawy

Manal last night, and she retweeted several opinions that stressed that the
time for women empowerment has came to Saudi Arabia:

Fouz Abdullah [(@FouzAbd)](http://twitter.com/#!/FouzAbd), a young Saudi
female tweep, wrote about Manal and women's legitimate right to drive through
her Twitter account, warning [ar] the religious police of their war against
women:

> لا نحتاج الى وصي او رقيب لكي نحافظ على عفتنا وشرفنا. ارحلوا #haya'a

[@FouzAbd](http://twitter.com/#!/FouzAbd/status/72065125791707136): We do not
need a guardian or someone to watch us out, in order to keep our purity and
honor. LEAVE

Kuwaiti female tweep, Rana Al-Abdulrazaq
([@ranati01](http://twitter.com/#!/ranati01)) , also showed solidarity with
Manal Al-Sharif saying [ar]:

> ما قامت به منال الشريف اليوم هو شجاعة حقيقية .. امرأة تصارع ارثا مثقلا من
> الجهالة والموروث الذكوري المجحف

[@Ranati01](http://twitter.com/#!/ranati01/status/72052876842778624): What
Manal Al-Sharif has done today was real courage.. A woman fighting a tradition
of ignorance and masculinity.

Another Saudi woman, Nawwarah Ashad
(@[@nawwarah82](http://twitter.com/#!/nawwarah82)), mocked the societal
statement that claims Saudi women are “queens” so they should not be working
or driving but kept and served at home:

> [@nawwarah82](http://twitter.com/#!/nawwarah82/status/72052993058537472):
> how am i a #queen in saudi when a queen “rules” a country while i can't even
> vote on a municipal election & need a guardian to rule myself!

Egyptian tweep, Maha Hosny ([@Maha114411](http://twitter.com/#!/Maha114411)),
wrote about the importance of what Manal has done, before she was arrested
again, saying:

> منال خرجت من السجن بس دخلت التاريخ و هى فعلا تستحق الاحترام و لن يضيع حق
> وراءه مطالب ده ابسط الحقوق فى ايه؟؟
> [#manalalsharif](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23manalalsharif
> "#manalalsharif")

[@Maha114411](http://twitter.com/#!/Maha114411/status/72042430626672640):
Manal is out of jail but has entered history. She deserves respect. A right
that is struggled for by such women, will not be lost. This is one of the
simplest rights, why! #manalalsharif

Another Saudi tweep, Abdulaziz Al-Alami
([@AzizAlAlami](http://twitter.com/#!/AzizAlAlami/)), commented[
](http://twitter.com/#!/AzizAlAlami/status/72172360601579520)on Manal's
arrest:

> [@AzizAlAlami](http://twitter.com/#!/AzizAlAlami/status/72172360601579520):

Another Saudi tweep, Heba Al-Butairi ([@H_eba](http://twitter.com/#!/H_eba)),
who has been active online lately for the rights of Saudi women, wrote about
Manal saying:

> [@H_eba:](http://twitter.com/#!/H_eba/status/72079693112807424) #FreeManal
> Took a turn from the oppressive to the INSANE! Dragging her out of of her

Another Saudi female online activist, Khuloud Al-Fahad
([@Khulouds](http://twitter.com/#!/khulouds)) showed support for Manal Al-
Sharif:

> القبض على منال بهذه الطريقة هو لإرهابنا من الخروج للقيادة وتخويف أولياء
> أمورهن وبث الرعب في نفوسهم لكن ماقامت به منال خلق مليون منال

[@Khulouds](http://twitter.com/#!/khulouds/status/72151280834985984): The way
Manal was arrested is their way to terrify us so we won't go out to drive and
to scare our fathers, but what Manal has done created another million Manal

Saudi novelist Badriya Al-Bishir
([@badryahalbeshr](http://twitter.com/#!/badryahalbeshr)) also tweeted to show
support for Manal and criticize her arrest:

> من الذي خالف؟ منال خالفت القانون أم القانون خالف منال؟ وكيف يستوي قانونا لا
> يساوي بين المواطنات والمواطنين

[@badryahalbeshr](http://twitter.com/#!/badryahalbeshr/status/72200310164164608):
Who broke the laws? Manal broke the laws or the Laws broke Manal? How could
laws be justified if they do not apply equality between female and males
citizens
