After being pressured by conservative politicians and hardline groups, which
branded Lady Gaga as a devil worshiper, the Indonesian police announced that
it won't issue a permit to the highly anticipated Lady Gaga concert in
Jakarta, leaving over 50,000 fans disappointed.

FPI or the Islamic Defenders Front is an influential religious group which
often campaigns against ‘anti-Islamic’ activities and ideas. In this
particular case, Lady Gaga was accused of corrupting the morality of young
Indonesians.

Lady Gaga fans, who were called ‘little monsters’, have criticized the
government's decision:

What right do they have. I'm the one who have been saving up; looking hard for
scalpers, then you suddenly ban the concert.

What I found odd was the police giving an excuse saying that Gaga (act) is
pornographic. What about dangdut concerts?

Dangdut, an Indian influenced folk music, is very popular in Indonesia. The
dance moves of Dangdut performers are oftentimes sexy and erotic.

Meanwhile, the Christian Indonesian Church Council (PGI)
[supported](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/indonesian-church-council-
supports-lady-gaga-concert/518045) the concert arguing that it's a part of the
country's freedom of expression.

Not all politicians found Lady Gaga's performance racy. Lawmaker Ahmad
Basarah, who is a Muslim, [told](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/middle-
eastern-ideology-as-dangerous-as-lady-gaga-indonesian-lawmaker/518063)
newspaper The Jakarta Globe that the national police should be fair when it
comes to protecting the nation's values, whether it's against liberal-
capitalistic ideas or Middle Eastern ideologies.
