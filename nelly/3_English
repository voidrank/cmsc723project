Millions of dead fish are flooding the news in Việt Nam. All the information,
speculation, and outrage over what's happening on the central coast can get
overwhelming, so let's break it down into five key points.

### **1\. The cause is unknown, but the suspicions are plenty.**

Local fishermen started noticing masses of dead fish blanketing local beaches
in Hà Tĩnh province in early April. Soon, more of these sightings emerged and
media reports estimate that more than [70 tons of dead
fish](http://www.voatiengviet.com/content/ca-chet-va-hinh-anh-dat-
nuoc/3319572.html) have now washed ashore the coasts of four provinces in
central Việt Nam. Carcasses of marine life, such as
[clams](http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/thoi-su/301178/hue-ca-voi-chet-bat-thuong-dat-
vao-bo-bien.html) and even the occasional
[whale](http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/thoi-su/301178/hue-ca-voi-chet-bat-thuong-dat-
vao-bo-bien.html), are strewn across 125 miles of beaches.

To date, the government has not offered an explanation of the cause, but that
hasn’t stopped people from speculating. Citizen journalists, scientists, and
those affected most — fishermen and their families —have joined in a multitude
of attempts to seek answers. Even state media is asking tough questions.

Fingers are pointing at the [Formosa Hà Tĩnh Steel
Corporation](http://www.fhs.com.tw/), accusing it of discharging toxic
wastewater into the ocean.

The crisis brings into the foreground concerns about environmental
degradation, food safety, and lax or unenforced business regulation. Those who
rely on the water and fish for their livelihoods are bearing the brunt of this
ecological disaster.

### **2\. Formosa is no stranger to polluting the environment.**

While a definite link between Formosa’s wastewater and the fish deaths has not
been established, locals point to a host of circumstantial evidence.

According to Lao Động newspaper, on April 4 a local diver found the steel
mill’s discharge pipe [spewing](http://laodong.com.vn/thoi-su-xa-hoi/vu-ca-
chet-hang-loat-o-bien-mien-trung-nuoc-thai-co-mau-vang-duc-rat-ngua-va-kho-
tho-544345.bld) dark yellow water. Two days later, the first waves of dead
fish began to wash ashore, and locals
[noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6a-jdoqVkM) a yellow substance in
the ocean water. Later in April, Đất Việt newspaper reported that divers
working on contract for Formosa ended up being hospitalized after diving in
the water near the plant. One diver [died](http://baodatviet.vn/chinh-tri-xa-
hoi/tin-tuc-thoi-su/1-tho-lan-tu-vong-5-nguoi-suc-khoe-yeu-o-
formosa-3306757/).

Formosa spokesman Chu Xuân Phàm tipped his hand in an interview with VTC14,
when the reporter presented him with the observation many local fishermen had
made: The previously plentiful waters have become devoid of any marine life
since the arrival of the wastewater treatment system. His response enraged
many.

> Many times in life, people have to make a choice: either to catch and sell
> fish, or to develop the steel industry. We cannot have both.

Phàm was [fired](http://tuoitre.vn/tin/chinh-tri-xa-hoi/20160427/ong-chu-xuan-
pham-xac-nhan-da-bi-formosa-duoi-viec/1091563.html) a few days after the
interview, while people across Việt Nam declared: “Tôi chọn cá”, meaning “I
choose fish.“

In 2009, Formosa was
[shamed](https://www.ethecon.org/download/0911%20Open%20letter%20ethecon%20FORMOSA.pdf)
by environment watchdog Ethecon for its poor environmental record, including
dumping hazardous chemicals into the Mississippi River, and leaving mercury-
laced waste at their seaport in Cambodia.

### **3\. Angry citizens are taking action both online and off.**

The grievances from citizens in this crisis range from frustration over lack
of accountability, to real fear over survival.

A local fisherman
[lambasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yYqzgNSSGY&feature=youtu.be)
officials, telling the Saigon Broadcasting Television Network the government
does not value the lives of their own people.

> People have died, fish have died. And those of us who are alive are being
> told to ‘go swim in the water, go eat the fish, it’s fine’. Clearly they
> don’t look at us as people, but animals. They want us to die with the fish.
> They look at Formosa as gods. The foreign investment benefits them as a
> whole and as individuals.

Social media has exploded over the crisis. A “We The People”
[petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/help-vietnamese-people-
prevent-environmental-disaster-ha-tinh-province-central-vietnam) calling for
an independent investigation garnered over 100,000 signatures within 48 hours,
just ahead of US President Barack Obama’s visit to Việt Nam. As online action
caught fire, so did offline uproar.

Protests started at the end of April in the central region, first in [Quảng
Bình](http://tinhdongchuacuuthe.com/tin-nong-da-co-bieu-tinh-ve-tham-hoa-moi-
truong-o-quang-binh/), then in [Huế](http://tinhdongchuacuuthe.com/dam-tang-
ca-tai-hue/). Then starting last week, in [Sài Gòn](http://www.nguoi-
viet.com/absolutenm2/templates/viewarticlesNVO.aspx?articleid=227265&zoneid=1)
and Hà Nội thousands took to the streets to
[demand](http://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/vietnam/2016/05/160501_vietnam_protest_formosa)
answers, accountability, and transparency.

Two prominent former prisoners of conscience, Trương Minh Tam and Chu Mạnh
Sơn, were arrested as they attempted to report on the crisis. Both have been
[released](http://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/vietnam/2016/05/160504_truongminhtam_freed).

On May 6 and 7, citizens once again took to the streets to demonstrate. On May
8, protests in Hà Nội and Sài Gòn were [shut
down](https://xuandienhannom.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/tuong-thuat-truc-tiep-tu-
ha-noi-va-sai.html?m=1) within an hour. Scores of peaceful protesters were
[shuffled](http://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/vietnam/2016/05/160508_protest_fish_death_environment)
onto police buses and sent to detention centers. Others were forcefully [split
up](https://www.facebook.com/hoang.binh.3114/videos/603232363167799/), [pepper
sprayed](https://www.facebook.com/mc.quang/posts/1405671356125127), and
[beaten](https://www.facebook.com/danlambaovn/videos/1051630108225640/).

### **4\. The Vietnamese government isn't offering any answers.**

Environment Minister Trần Hồng Hà
[declared](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fr-
vietnam-tells-taiwan-firm-to-dig-up-waste-pipe-amid-red-tide-
disaster-2016-4&t=NzMwZjc5NTNmZTBhODlkN2NmZjg2N2Y4ZDZiZDVmNjRmZjczMTU2MyxrY2diTVZiOA%3D%3D)
the waste pipe illegal after officials examined water samples around the site,
but there have still been no announcements at the national level to address
neither the cause nor the call for an independent investigation. Hà also
apologized on behalf of the Ministry of Environment for its passivity, but
both his higher up and his deputy were on a different page.

General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng
[received](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fanhbasam.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F04%2F30%2F8069-tai-

criticism after visiting Formosa’s board of directors in Hà Tĩnh to check on
ongoing projects without visiting
[victims](http://www.voatiengviet.com/content/ong-nguyen-phu-trong-khong-nhac-
toi-vu-ca-chet-o-ha-tinh/3299768.html) or publicly addressing the fish deaths.

Meanwhile, Environment Minister Deputy Võ Tuấn Nhân evaded questions from
state media.

### **5\. People are freaking out over fish sauce.**

Following public outcry over lack of answers, in the central provinces the
government has banned the use of the dead fish as food or animal feed, but
many locals are concerned that without any oversight the carcasses may still
be processed into fish sauce.

Some people are stocking up on fish sauce, in fear that future batches will
carry toxic traces. National broadcaster VTV reports that at one Coopmart in
Đà Nẵng, the supermarket [sold out](http://vtv.vn/trong-nuoc/ca-chet-hang-
loat-nguoi-dan-do-xo-mua-nuoc-mam-muoi-du-tru-20160501172017136.htm) of its
stock of fish sauce, salts, and canned fish for multiple days in a row. The
supermarket’s deputy director told state media that fish purchases have tanked
and people are now buying more [poultry](http://vov.vn/xa-hoi/ca-chet-hang-
loat-nguoi-dan-lo-du-tru-nuoc-mam-do-kho-505702.vov).

For ordinary citizens, the demand for these items is in line with their
anxiety over food safety, health and well-being.

As national tension and international attention grows, the Vietnamese
government is under scrutiny not only in how it addresses the people’s demand
for accountability, but also how it handles the public outcry. And it doesn’t
look like the protests are dying down.

Fish deaths have become personal in Việt Nam.
