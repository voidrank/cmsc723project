[Educación Viva ](http://www.educacionviva.org/ "Educación viva site")(Live
Education) has released the first of their videos challenging traditional
education systems, titled _I Don't Believe in Schools but I do Believe in
Education_. In the subtitled video, more than 20 men and women read aloud a
poem on the educational system and how it is different from what they believe
education is.

> ¿Qué pasa si te digo que saber no necesariamente es comprender?  
>  Que conocimiento es importante,  
>  pero solo absorber información nos hace más ignorantes.  
>  Comprender es haberlo vivido y experimentado.  
>  Saber es simplemente poder acumularlo.  
>  La Educación sirve para crecer y desarrollarnos,  
>  la Escuela para aprobar el examen y graduarnos como esclavos.

What happens if I tell you that knowing is not necessarily understanding?  
That knowledge is important,  
but just absorbing information makes us more ignorant.  
Understanding is having lived it and experienced it.  
Knowing is just being able to accumulate it.  
Education allows us to grow and develop,  
Schools to pass exams and graduate as slaves.

  
With their campaign, they are trying to get more people to send in their own
video responses of the [poem](http://www.educacionviva.org/wp-
content/uploads/2012/03/educacionviva-poema.pdf "Poem in Spanish"). The poem
should be clearly understood and they suggest using the same music released
under Creative Commons for their videos. A second part of the video will be
released at a future date.
