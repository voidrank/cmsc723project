Dogs Arrested by security forces in Tehran. Photo by Iranspca.com, used with

Pet dogs have been arrested in Tehran, Iran again by security forces, and it's
a deja vu of [events in 2007 and
2011](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/10/iran-dogs-arrested-again/).
Surreal but true. The Iranian Society for Prevention of Cruelty Against
Animals [report](http://www.iranspca.com/pages/) [fa] that last week about 20
dogs in Pardisan Park were arrested as their owners walked them. They were
moved to a center, let's call it jail. Owners have so far failed to have their
pets released them. The video below shows the creatures disturbed behind bars.
It seems “man's best friend” is an enemy to the Islamic Republic.

Iran's government considers keeping pet dogs un-Islamic, but has mostly
tolerated it. It is possible that because the people most likely to keep dogs
are Iran's urban and educated youth, dogs may be generating more official
hostility again.
