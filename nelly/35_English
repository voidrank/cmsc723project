Dressed like the Na'vi tribe from the 2009 science-fiction film
[Avatar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_\(2009_film\)), Cambodian
villagers protested the plan to clear the Prey Lang forest to make way for the
establishment of plantations and mines. [Prey
Lang](http://ourpreylang.wordpress.com/about/) is the “largest primary lowland
dry evergreen forest remaining both in Cambodia and on the Indochinese
Peninsular”:

> Prey Lang is arguably the largest intact area of indigenous land left in
> Cambodia. Located between the Mekong and Stung Sen Ricers, the forest
> straddles four provinces (Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom, Kratie, and Stung
> Treng.)
>
> About 200,000 people, mostly indigenous Kuy (pronounced Koo-ie,) live in 339
> villages in six districts surrounding the forest. As many as 350,000 people
> live in the greater Prey Lang area.

The ‘Avatar’ protesters have also maximized the cyberspace to gather more
support for their campaign. Aside from an [online
petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/help-save-cambodias-prey-lang-
forest) to save the forest, a [blog](http://ourpreylang.wordpress.com/) was
set-up to provide public updates on some of their activities like prayer
ceremonies and leaflet distribution.

In behalf of the Prey Lang Network, the [Cambodian Center for Human
Rights](http://www.cchrcambodia.org/index.php?url=media/media.php&p=press_detail.php&prid=189&id=5)
highlights the views of villagers who stand to suffer the most if Prey Lang
forest is destroyed.

> Minh Ny from Prey Lang: “Through this peaceful event I hope that we save
> Prey Lang for the next generation and make the media and public know about
> the importance of the forest to the lives of the residents who live within
> it and to the environment more generally.”
>
> Phok Hong, an indigenous Kuy from Prey Lang: “If I lose Prey Lang, I lose my
> life. Everyday I worry about losing Prey Lang. I worry that the land broker
> and the company will destroy it and I will lose my way of life. If we lose
> Prey Lang we lose the forest, the herbal remedies, the wild life and most
> importantly the indigenous traditions that have been passed down through
> many generations of our ancestors. Today I will pray for the world to
> appreciate the importance of Prey Lang and help us put and end to this
> conflict”.
>
> Seng Sokheng a representative of the Community Peace-building Network: “The
> scale of this event is unprecedented and yet it does not fully reflect the
> gravity of the threat against Prey Lang. Though all land conflicts can
> destroy lives those that relate to the destruction of natural resources and
> forest areas create environmental changes that will affect generations. It
> is great to see communities uniting together against injustices relating to
> land and, particularly, to the management of our natural resources.”

Prey Lang Avatar

The protests have been generally peaceful but the recent activity of the Prey
Lang ‘Avatars’ involving a Buddhist prayer ceremony and leaflet distribution
was disrupted by Phnom Penh's local authorities. More than 100 individuals
were briefly detained and questioned but they were released afterwards. The
[photos](http://sithi.org/temp.php?url=photo_gallery1.php&parent_id=61&) and
[videos](http://sithi.org/temp.php?url=videos_list.php&) of the arrest are
available on a Cambodian human rights portal, [Sithi](http://sithi.org/).

A documentary about Prey Lang, [“One Forest, One
Future”](http://mouthtosource.org/rivers/preylang/the-video-documentary/), was
produced by Jocelyn and Ben Pederick:

Those who support the struggle of the indigenous communities living in Prey
Lang are encouraged to write to the government of Cambodia. Below is an
excerpt of a [sample letter](http://www.earthaction.org/2011/08/save-the-prey-
lang-forest-in-cambodia.html) addressed to Prime Minister Hun Sen

> Dear Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen,
>
> I am writing to you to urge you to do everything in your power to protect
> the Prey Lang forest which is an important resource for the people of
> Cambodia, of Southeast Asia, and of the world.
>
> I ask you to take the following actions:
>
> –Suspend all logging and mining concessions in the greater Prey Lang area
>
> –Confer Prey Lang with protected status and enforce its protection
>
> –Replant already cleared areas of the forest
>
> –Commit to sustainably managing the forest in cooperation with the Prey Lang
> Community Network.
