China's top Internet entrepreneur [Ma Yun
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ma)has warned that no amount of money can
protect the rich from China's cancer-causing pollution. His comments resonated
with web users, many of whom are already
[alarmed](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/02/19/citizens-document-extreme-
water-pollution-in-china/) by the country's toxic combination of air and water
contamination and food safety issues.

During the 13th annual meeting of the Yabuli China Entrepreneurs Forum, the
founder and CEO of leading Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, bypassed
business opportunities to address China's pollution-linked health problems in
his speech. He
[predicted](http://politics.caijing.com.cn/2013-02-23/112524387.html) [zh]
that cancer will trouble every Chinese family in 10 years.

He also stressed that citizens should be more environmentally aware and should
not rely on the government only:

> 有多少人30年以前，有多少人知道我们边上谁谁谁有癌症，那个时候癌症是一个稀有的名词，今天癌症变成了一种常态。肝癌，可能是因为水；肺癌是因为我们的空气；胃癌，是我们的食物。特权阶级有特权的水，这次没有特供的空气了。我担心我们这么辛苦，最后所有挣的钱最后都是医药费。不管你挣多少钱，享受不到沐浴阳光，其实是很大的悲哀。

different areas of China.

According to the map, eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai have a high
frequency of gastric cancer, while the southeast has a high frequency of liver
cancer. Moreover, six people are diagnosed with cancer and five people die
from cancer every five minutes in China. According to the
[news](http://politics.caijing.com.cn/2013-02-23/112524482.html), the high
frequency of cancer has a lot to do with an unhealthy lifestyle, with the
environment being one of the biggest threats to health.
