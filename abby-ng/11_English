The Chinese entertainment industry's relentless production of films about
[Japan's World War II-era invasion of
China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria) has come
under the spotlight after TV extra Shi Zhongpeng made headlines in China last
week for reportedly [having acted as a Japanese
soldier](http://news.china.com/pinglun/gdrd/11132979/20130205/17671742.html)
[zh] more than 200 times last year and even having “died” eight times in a
single day for different projects.

With China and Japan currently sparring over islands in the East China Sea,
the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 has become a safe and popular
choice for movie directors who continuously face strict censorship. For
example, in Hengdian film studio in China's eastern Zhejiang province, about
48 movies dealing with the Japan's invasion of China were shot in 2012.

“There's a limit on historical dramas and spy stories allowed to be aired
during prime time slots,” Zhou Weicheng, general manager of Greentown Media
told [Chengdu Business
News](http://news.china.com/pinglun/gdrd/11132979/20130205/17671742.html)
[zh]. “What can we shoot other than the Japanese invasion?”

For these reasons, Chinese TV channels have been inundated with anti-Japanese
movies aimed to educate, euphemistically speaking, the Chinese audience.
Chinese media and netizens have questioned the intention of authorities and
expressed concern over movie censorship.

Commentator Yu Deqing further
[explained](http://ent.cnr.cn/list/201302/t20130206_511932442.html) [zh]: “The
Chinese movie industry has two aspects: on one hand, some sensitive topics are
strictly censored; on the other hand, some mainstream topics will get
government funds, such as those about the Japanese invasion. Movies with
breakthrough ideas that require advanced technology are difficult to get past
censors or get government funding.”

> 抗日片不真实让我们觉得抗战是场游戏，这会误导我们的人民。这是对历史的背叛，强调历史的真实能让我们更清楚的去面对明天！日本拍得日美之间的战争和德国拍得德苏之间的战争，美国人近几年拍得二战大片中，都真实得让人对战争和人性进行深层次的思考。这才是一个民族自信的源泉！
