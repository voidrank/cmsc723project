China is not just competing with the United States, but has also done research
on the time it will take to surpass them. According to China's
[Xinhua](http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90883/8084050.html) news agency, a
report released on January 8, 2013, by the Chinese Academy of Sciences says
that China is likely to surpass the United States in all areas by 2049, and
the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be realized. The research comes
with a detailed schedule of the potential process.

If Mao were still alive, he would definitely think the process is taking too
long. As he [mentioned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward) in
1957, he predicted it would take 15 years to catch up with or surpass the UK.

Yang Duogyui, head of the research group,
[explained](http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2013-01/09/c_124209228.htm) [zh]
the statement:

>
> 我们国家提出“民族伟大复兴”，我个人认为，‘复兴’，就是做当之无愧的世界第一。至于2049年能不能实现，未来几十年中不确定因素很多，我们这个报告是按照当前发展情况不变来分析的。”“‘国家健康’是一个新概念，大家有些异议很正常。

> When we say “the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, I personally think
> “rejuvenation” means to be unquestionably number 1 in the world. As to
> whether it will be realized, there are many uncertain elements in the
> future. Our report is based on the current conditions of “national health”,
> which is a new concept; it’s normal for people to have doubts about it.

He added that the group will continue with the research. Despite his
explanation, the statement has been made fun of on Sina Weibo, with netizens
urging the real problems in China to be faced. Even Xinhua News Agency [wrote
