A short sci-fi film titled “Hong Kong Will Be Destroyed After 33 Years” has
become a viral hit and earned the ire of China's censors.

The seven minute and 28 second video, which has attracted
[645,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YzCXjm2yOU) views since its upload
to YouTube on March 3, 2014, features apathetic Hong Kongers indifferent to an
approaching meteor, set to hit in 2047—the year when Hong Kong, a Special
Administrative Region of China, stops having separate laws from the mainland.

In the film, more than two-thirds of the city's people as well as large
corporations leave after learning news of the meteor. The resulting emptying
of the city lets small businesses flourish and frees up housing for everyone.
The city is, in a sense, reborn, despite its impending doom. Eventually,
scientists are able to destroy the meteor before it hits.

The video reveals Hong Kongers’ anxieties over political and social issues,
such as their increasingly crowded and materialist city and the growing
numbers of mainlanders since the city's transfer from the United Kingdom to
China in 1997. It sends the opposite message of a very [common
view](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/01/24/hong-kong-rethinks-its-
relationship-with-mainland-china/) among mainlanders, that without China's
economic support, Hong Kong would have been dead long ago.

One netizen,
“[iseeyouinmyheart](http://www.youtube.com/profile_redirector/106838958551178160042),”
commented on YouTube:

> To me, HK is already finished. I can no longer feel the air of freedom,
> justice, rule of law, and fairness that I did before 1997.

Inevitably, the short video was blocked on Chinese video websites such as
Youku. According to the blog [Fei Chang
Dao](http://blog.feichangdao.com/2014/04/sina-weibo-censors-title-of-
science.html), search results for “33 Years” were being suppressed on both
Baidu and Sina Weibo. According to [China Digital
Times](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/03/minitrue-missing-lawyers-sci-fi-
michelle-obama/), Chinese propaganda authorities’ order was
[leaked](http://handbill.us/?p=30048) online:

Yik Kan Cheung, a VFX artist and post-production supervisor of the video, told
[The Diplomat](http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/beijings-censors-ban-hong-kong-
short-film/) why they think the video was banned in mainland:

> The reason the video is being censored by authorities is, we believe, that
> they think what they’re doing is keeping the society peaceful. But, what we
> think they are doing is keeping people away from knowing the truth, that
> China is trying to suffocate Hong Kong to death by importing Mainland
> Chinese into Hong Kong until there’s enough people for them to control the
> elections. After that, there will be no open elections in Hong Kong.
