China’s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and
Television (SARFT) has started to crack down on online TV shows by introducing
a policy of “[censor first, broadcast
later](http://news.163.com/14/0327/05/9OAPQ3IM00014AED.html)” for local
Internet companies.

According to the new rule, online companies will have to employ government-
approved censors to monitor content before all streaming videos go public.
Investors and operators from the companies who stream content that has not
been officially approved will be warned, fined or punished with a ban on
streaming content for up to five years.

Until now, online companies like [Youku](http://www.youku.com) and
[Tudou](http://www.tudou.com) have been relying on in-house censors.

According to [Hollywood
Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chinas-censors-clamp-down-
booming-689865), SAPPRFT said:

> Service companies broadcasting Internet audio and video programs, such as
> online dramas and microfilms etc., should have qualified personnel examining
> the content, who meet the requirements for checking and have been trained by
> state or provincial Internet video and audio programs industry associations.
> They should have a solid editing and censorship management system for
> program content, and need a legally obtained license to stream video and
> audio programs, issued by the SAPPRFT, and should strictly follow the
> permission to develop business within the permitted business scope,
> purchased content will be treated the same as self-produced content.

Earlier this year, legislation
[required](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/21/china-online-video-
censorship) that anyone who uploads videos, including microfilms (or short
films on the Internet) and other user-generated content, must be registered
with their real names, and all microfilms must be censored before posting
them.

American TV shows have gained great popularity in China over the past few
years.

China’s online video viewers reached 450 million earlier this year, and the
number is still growing. The new rule is aimed mainly at American TV shows and
[microfilms](http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-microfilm.htm). American TV shows
such as [House of Cards](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/19/world/asia/china-house-
of-cards-jiang/) and the Walking Dead have gained great popularity during the
past year, but according to the new rule, these shows aren't likely to be
approved.

To circumvent the censorship, some American companies have reportedly come up
with two versions of the shows to make sure they don’t lose the huge market in
China. Although several video providers have not been informed of the specific
rules of this crackdown yet, they have already slowed down their purchasing of
American shows with sensitive content.

Rumor has it that supernatural-themed shows and horror stories are most likely
suffer from the new policy, and that 80 percent of American shows will be
pulled online. Many video sites have already shifted some of their focus to
Japanese and South Korean TV soap operas.

The news has triggered anger and complaints among many netizens. According to
Sina Weibo [poll](http://huati.weibo.com/915202?refer=index_hot_new), over
120,000 netizens voted against this censorship rule, compared to 6,000 who
were in favor.

One netizen [joked:](http://weibo.com/jokerorjoker)

> 美剧首先中枪，估计接下来黑镜这种神剧也会被禁吧？然后就是日剧，情爱棒子剧，最后大家就坐在电视机看30几套电视台放杀鬼子的电视来弘扬民族精神

> American shows are the first to go, and next [British] shows like Black
> Mirror will be censored as well. Then Japanese shows, romance-centric Korean
> shows, and in the end everyone will sit in front of the television watching
> over 30 channels broadcasting shows about killing Japanese invaders to
