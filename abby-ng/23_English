On Dec 14, 2012, 20 children were
[killed](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/15/15907407-elementary-
school-massacre-20-children-among-28-killed-in-connecticut-slaughter?lite) in
a gun shooting in Connecticut, US. The sad news was immediately all over
China’s CCTV and made the headlines of major newspapers in China.

On the same day, another school tragedy took place in central China: a[ man
stabbed and injured 22
children](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/world/asia/man-stabs-22-children-
in-china.html).

However, the news was soon censored. There was not a single mention of the
domestic tragedy in Chinese mainstream media. The only source to find out the
news was through
[Weibo](http://huati.weibo.com/25972?refer=index_hot_new&pos=1_1&ver=5),
China’s twitter.

CCTV and other major media’s two different attitudes to the news coverage drew
netizens’ attention, which soon became the [hottest topic on
Weibo](http://huati.weibo.com/25972?refer=index_hot_new&pos=1_1&ver=5) [zh].
While expressing their sympathy for the children, netizens compared the
different approaches to the incidents in the US and China, and questioned the
unfair censorship and ignorance of human rights in China. Some netizens tried
to report the news themselves by posting pictures of injured children on
Weibo.

Below are some comments from famous bloggers and commentators on Weibo [zh]:

> 大鹏看天下:
> 【你们不报道，我们自己来！】美国孩子出事，奥巴马垂泪，全美降半旗，中国中央电视台《新闻联播》发头条。中国孩子出事，当地教育局的干部在办公室开着暖气玩游戏，各大媒体全部噤声，无耻地沉默，仅在微博能看到一些零碎消息…这是目前可见的照片集合。

Among the online rage towards Chinese government and media, there’s one
different voice. Hu Xijin, chief editor of the government mouthpiece newspaper
Global Times tried to divert netizens’ attention to the US by criticizing the
American government [zh]:

>
> 胡锡进：美国小学枪击案致28死，不仅这种枪击案的反复发生骇人听闻，美国政府的不作为同样令人吃惊。难道这不是人权灾难吗？美国校园发生枪击案比中国校车出事造成孩子死亡多多了，但美国政府在袖手旁观。我不明白美国的家长们为何能够忍受。可怜那些孩子。

> [胡锡进](http://weibo.com/1989660417/z9POD4E8x)：The American primary school
> massacre resulted in 28 deaths. Not only are such shootings appalling, but
> the attitude of U.S. government was equally surprising. Isn’t it a human

> deaths than [even] Chinese school bus accidents, but the U.S. government

> Poor children.

Hu’s comment failed to resonate, and resulted in a great deal of criticism
instead. One netizen responded [zh]:

> 段郎说事: 美国政府是否作为，由美国人民去判断和处置，胡操什么心？还是多操心家门内的孩子安全吧！
