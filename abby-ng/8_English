A group of Chinese journalists launched a new media production platform for
history related content — the _New History Cooperative_ (新历史合作社). Their
products — including books, magazines, events and videos — are shared through
the internet and through WeChat and Weibo. One of the latest projects is
documentary series about 100 “[Chinese
words](http://dy.163.com/article/T1383646376311/9GI2A2MB00964KPI.html)” —
terms like _zheng shen_ , or “examination of one’s political record,” and
_jiating chushen_ , meaning someone’s “political pedigree”.

According to [China Media Project](http://cmp.hku.hk/2014/02/26/34946/), many
intellectuals find the project meaningful. Writer Hu Fayun said: “Chinese
words are words particular to China, they are words that reveal how China’s
unique character came to be.” This documentary series is an opportunity to
reflect back on China's history and admonish many aspects of China's present
political and social circumstances. Watch the video below about the project
overview.
