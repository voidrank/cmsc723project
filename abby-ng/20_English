China's [one-child policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy) is
unshakeable, a top family planning official announced on January 14, 2013.
Minister of the National Population and Family Planning Commission Wang Xia
[said](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1128977/population-minister-
wang-xia-says-one-child-policy-here-stay):

> The policy should be a long-term one, and its primary goal is to maintain a
> low birth rate and be gradually perfected.

The debate about whether it's time to phase out the policy
[started](http://www.tealeafnation.com/2012/11/online-poll-shows-overwhelming-
support-for-end-to-chinas-one-child-policy/) in China recently, fueled last
year partly by public disgust with instances of forced abortion. In July 2012,
15 scholars called for a two-child policy; in Nov 2012, over 30 economists[
urged ](http://dawn.com/2012/10/31/chinese-think-tank-urges-end-to-one-child-
policy/)an end to the one-child policy. The announcement, which dismissed
[speculation](http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-202_162-3897473.html) that the one-
child policy would be scrapped, has triggered another heated debate on Chinese
social media. On Sina

Weibo, it became [the number 1 hot
topic](http://huati.weibo.com/27053?refer=index_hot_new&pos=1_1&ver=5&order=time)
on January 16 and 17. On the Weibo survey, over 12,000 web users maintained
that it was time to phase out the one-child policy while only about 5,000
still support the policy.

The supporters argue that China has already got a big population, without the
policy, there would be too many people. Global Times Chief Editor [Hu
Xijin](http://weibo.com/1989660417/zeALO84sL) [Hz] took the lead:

> 支持坚持计划生育大格局，同时支持部分、逐渐放开一些具体政策。中国的高生育率得以控制住，这是了不起的社会成
> 就。我不希望后代们生活在20亿人口甚至30亿人口的中国…我周围的很多双独已经开始生2个孩子了， 祝贺他们。但这不意味计划生育的终结。

> I support the one-child policy; at the same time, I support a gradual

> mean the end of the one-child policy.

However, supporters seemed to ignore China's current demographic problems
caused by the one-child policy. Many scholars and economists argue that the
one-child policy resulted in a series of long-term social problems, including
a rapidly aging population and gender imbalance. The also say that the Chinese
would not have had many more children without the policy.

Co-founder of Ctrip [Liang Jianzhang](http://weibo.com/u/1946109133)[zh]
called for urgent reform of the policy:

> 僵化的生育政策导致倒金字塔的人口结构，为中国经济发展埋下了巨大的隐患，引发各种社会问题，改革刻不容缓！

> This rigid policy led to an “inverted pyramid” population structure with
> unforeseen risks to China's economic development and various social
> problems. Policy reform is not to be delayed!

Liang also [wrote](http://cn.wsj.com/gb/20130115/LJZ131847.asp) [zh] a
commentary on the Chinese version of Wall Street Journal explaining why
maintaining a low birth rate is no longer necessary.

Professor [Wu Bihu](http://weibo.com/1800850901/zexHlmy5Z) from Beijing
Univeristy further explained:

>
> 因为计生委有行政编制、准生寻租、超生罚款等利益链，国家不应被计生委绑架。强制人流谋杀生命、独生子女社会问题、性比例失衡、老龄化、城市化育子成本蹿升出生率下降等，都已预示计划生育政策可以洗洗睡了。

> There's a chain of interests involved within the Population and Family
> Planning Commission, as it concerns many people's jobs and large fines for a
> second baby. However, the state should not be “kidnapped” by the Population
> and Family Planning Commission. Forced abortion, the social problems from a
> single child, the imbalance in the sex ratio, a rapidly ageing population,
> the declining birth rate due to the rising cost of child-raising, all of
> these have indicated that the one-child policy can go to sleep.

[Yuan Li](http://weibo.com/1737694433/ezmoDhsp97W)[zh], chief editor of Wall
Street Journal China provided some revealing numbers to support Wu's
statement:

> 计生委成立于1981年，有50万全职雇员和600万兼职员工，每年征收的罚款达数百万美元

> The Population and Family Planning Commission was founded in 1981. There are
> now half a million full-time employees and 6 million part-time staff. They
> receive fines of up to millions of dollars each year.

Economist [Mao Yushi](http://weibo.com/1235457821/zeyOplX6Y)[zh] echoed:

> 其实，取消计划生育全国几十万的计生干部都要失业。这是生死存亡之战。

> In fact, the abolition of the policy means thousands of cadres would lose
> their jobs. This is the battle of life and death.

Social researcher [Yi Fuxian](http://weibo.com/1778542151/zepVkulMg)[zh]
analyzed on his blog:

>
> 现在很多人认为城市化可以保证中国经济继续高速增长。本文从人口结构分析，中国不可能重现日、台、韩当年那种经济奇迹。中国现在经济放缓并非偶然。城市化也是生育率跳跃性下降的过程，中国需要果断停止计划生育。

> The slowdown of China's economy is not accidental. The process of
