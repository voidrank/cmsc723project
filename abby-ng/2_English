One of China’s biggest dating websites [Baihe.com](http://baihe.com) probably
never imagined their seemingly smart and touching TV advertisement would
backfire and lead to an online protest.

In an effort to promote its offline dating service store, Beihe released a
commercial on TV during Chinese New Year. The holiday for family reunions is
also a frustrating period for many Chinese singles as the attention and
pressure surrounding personal matters from the whole family is simply
unbearable. So Baihe’s 30-second commercial comes right in time.

It’s about a young single woman who finally gets married for the sake of her
dying grandma. Her grandma asks whether she’s getting married each time she
goes back home regardless of her successful academic and career achievements.
The title reads: Because of love, I won't wait. The commercial only sends one
message: Whether or not it’s the right person, as long as you get married, you
have fulfilled the family's wish, your personal wish and happiness should be
subordinated to the family.

The commercial has triggered a lot of complaints online, saying it’s trying to
promote wrong marriage values by taking advantage of family kinship. On Feb 6
2014, netizen “Cai Puning” organized a campaign on Sina Weibo to protest
against Baihe. Within less than two days, over [7
million](http://huati.weibo.com/812172?refer=index_hot_new&filter=mining)
people joined the campaign. They urged that the commercial should be banned
and the Baihe website should apologize to the netizens.

One netizen “[Lao

Weibo:

> 在老外婆垂死前一声声催命似地追问下，女孩走进婚姻，又一个鲜活的生命成为亲情的殉葬品，“这是我见过的最恐怖最狼心狗肺的广告”。

> Before the dying old grandmother who cries urgently for her marriage, the
> girl rushed into marriage, and a lively life has become a sacrifice of
> family kinship. This is the most horrible and ungrateful ad I've ever seen.

Another netizen “[Gongda
Houyuaner](http://www.techweb.com.cn/column/2014-02-08/2004050.shtml)” is more
concerned about the gender inequality the commercial conveys:

> 其实逼婚并没有那么反感，但是通篇表达的性别歧视让人不满。否认女主角事业学业，只承认她的婚姻价值。

> Actually forced marriage is not so objectionable, but the expression of
> gender discrimination throughout annoys me. [The society] denies her
> academic career, and only recognizes the value of her marriage.
