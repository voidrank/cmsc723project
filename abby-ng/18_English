Looking to Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee's Oscar win for Best Director with
pride and envy, mainland Chinese web users frustrated with the communist
regime's tight grip on the film industry are wondering about their own
country's cinematic potential.

A search of Lee's name[ yields](http://huati.weibo.com/28410?from=525) [zh]
more than 70,886 results and 4,165,630 discussions, making it the second most
searched term on popular Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo as of the
afternoon of February 25, 2013.

This is the second Academy Award win for Lee, who thanked Taiwan during his
[acceptance
speech](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTE4OTM5NjIw.html?f=18992392) for its
cooperation in the making of “[Life of
Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi)“. In 2005, when he won the award
for Best Director for his movie [Brokeback
Mountain](http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/3482861/china-censors-ang-lee-
s-oscar-speech?page=all), the Chinese media censored his acceptance speech,
omitting any references to his native Taiwan or homosexuality.

Lee concluded his acceptance speech this time around with a “thank you” in
Mandarin, causing some Chinese viewers to swell with pride. But others warned
not be get so excited about the cultural nod, emphasizing that Lee's win had
nothing to do with China.

Some Weibo users, such as “[Qianzhe Yang Fang
Lang](http://weibo.com/u/1693426903)” [zh], put emphasis on the word “hua
ren”, a term used to describe ethnic Chinese people living abroad, as opposed
to “zhong guo ren”, meaning Chinese citizens:

Writer “Tianyou” [wondered](http://weibo.com/1567642010/zkOd44OuS) [zh] why
some were drawing a connection between mainland China and Lee：

>
> 李安导演获最佳导演，有人狂欢，说这是中国人的骄傲。我很是奇怪。人家李安获奖是人家个人的事儿，即使值得骄傲，那也是台湾教育，美式教育的成功，跟某些人有鸟关系？

However, Jiuzhouzhi magazine editor “Jiangnan Ricardo”
[disagreed](http://weibo.com/1191262305/zkOy5eLcv) [zh] that Lee's win meant
nothing for China:

>
> 虽然有朋友觉得李安获奖是个人的事，但我还是觉得究其履历和思维方式李安是个有明显中国文化烙印的中国导演，从「卧虎藏龙」至今他的电影中常有中国式的思辨，包括「派的一生」。他用他的方式让各国的人多一个了解中国文化的渠道,

Many netizens attributed Lee's success to the free entertainment industries in
Taiwan and the US. “Keguan Nvjia Yunchuang”

Famous commentator “Zhu Qi“ [wrote](http://weibo.com/u/1216294854) [zh]:

Ang Lee's win also served as a reminder of China's strict film censorship.

Just a few days’ before Ang Lee's win, China's State Administration of Radio
