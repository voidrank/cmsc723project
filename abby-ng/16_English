[posted](http://weibo.com/1197161814/znd5C1WAw?utm_)[zh] to his 32 million
fans on Sina Weibo an imaginary conversation between a Beijinger and a
Shanghainese:

> Beijinger: “We Beijingers are the most fortunate, we can open the window and
> have free cigarettes.” Shanghainese: “That's nothing, we can enjoy pork soup
> simply by turning on our faucets!!”

This sarcastic dialogue refers to the terrible air pollution in Beijing and
