Life is increasingly more expensive for everybody. Prices of basic food items
are high, and the price of oil keeps going up. In Mozambique, one of the
measures proposed by the Government to mitigate the impact of the increases in
the cost of living for Mozambicans has generated controversy with citizens.
The _[Basic Needs Basket
Subsidy](http://www.verdade.co.mz/economia/19143-manual-de-procedimentos-do-
subsidio-a-cesta-basica)_ had the aims of

> a) Assegurar o acesso do agregado familiar a alimentos básicos;  
>  b) Contribuir para manutenção de uma alimentação saudável e equilibrada;  
>  c) Proteger a capacidade de compra do indivíduo e agregado familiar contra
> eventuais aumentos de preços dos alimentos;  
>  d) Contribuir para estabilidade económica do agregado familiar de baixa
> renda;  
>  e) Contribuir para estabilidade social do país.

a) Guaranteeing household access to basic food items  
b) Contributing to a sustained, healthy and balanced diet  
c) Protecting the purchasing power of the individual and the household against
eventual food price increases  
d) Contributing to economic stability of the low income household  
e) Contributing to the social stability of the country.

The proposal by the Government of President Armando Guebuza had a start date
for June, but in spite of all expectations, its “abortion” was pronounced on
June 16. Citing the Prime Minister, blogger Carlos Serra
[wrote](http://oficinadesociologia.blogspot.com/2011/06/cesta-nao-e-
basica.html#links) “the country is stable and as such does not need the
Basket. What remains to be known is why in March the government introduced
it.”

In recent weeks, many disbelievers and some believers made public their
opinions on the proposal in the blogosphere and social networks.

**A Basket of basic needs and equality?**

In a series of vox-pop videos on Youtube, the [eligibility
criteria](http://youtu.be/kT_y2Uy83Ng) were called into question, which
brought some to believe in the [subsidy’s discriminatory
character](http://youtu.be/r12-RvSS6Us), given that the [Procedure
Manual](http://www.verdade.co.mz/economia/19143-manual-de-procedimentos-do-
subsidio-a-cesta-basica) indicated it was targeted at:

> Camadas Sociais de Baixa Renda (que vivem nos municípios de Pemba, Lichinga,
> Nampula, Quelimane, Tete, Chimoio, Beira, Inhambane, Xai-Xai, Matola e
> Maputo e tem rendimento individual igual ou inferior a 2.500,00Mts (cerca de
> 83 USD) por mês ou o rendimento per-capita do agregado familiar inferior ou
> igual a 840,00Mts(cerca de 28 USD))

Low income social groups (that live in the cities of Pemba, Lichinga, Nampula,
Quelimane, Tete, Chimoio, Beira, Inhambane, Xai-Xai, Matola and Maputo and
have a household income equal to or les than 2,500 Mts (about US $83) ou a per
capita income of the household equal to or less than US$ 28)

Lack of clarity and [information](http://youtu.be/kT_y2Uy83Ng) about the
social reach of the initiative was strongly criticized. Cremild Maculuve,
journalist, sceptical in relation to the “eligibility criteria of
beneficiaries”, [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/notes/cremildo-
maculuve/medidas-de-contan%C3%A7ao-a-arte-de-escrever-
na-%C3%A1gua/200723453282126) on his wall on Facebook about who he presumed
would benefit

> a cesta básica só poderá ser dada (…) aos que têm um emprego formal. Cenário
> mais sombrio, mas não descartável é que esta cinja-se aos funcionários
> públicos, o que, à partida – se olharmos para o número de funcionários
> públicos e multiplicarmos pelo número dos que beneficiam directamente dos
> seus rendimentos – excluirá perto de 90 por cento da população moçambicana.

The basic needs basket could only be given (…) to those who have formal
employment. A gloomy scenario, but not to be discarded, that it is intended
for public servants, which from the outset – if we look at the number of civil
servants and multiply by the number of those who benefit directly from their
earnings – would exclude almost 90% of the Mozambican population.

In another [note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/matias-de-
jesus-j%C3%BAnior/as-cegonhas-trazem-os-beb%C3%A9s-da-
fran%C3%A7a/168742836514936) on Facebook, the journalist Matias de Jesus
Junior also wondered about the target group of the proposed measures to
alleviate the high cost of living

> acredito que aqui estão a abrir um fosso imaginável, isto porque a mesma é
> socialmente injusta ou descriminatória. Afinal quem é o povo moçambicano, é
> somente o funcionário público ou também aquele desempregado, privado e o
> informal

I believe that they are opening here an imaginable division, this because the
measure is socially unjust and discriminatory. So who in the end is the
Mozambican people, is it just a civil servant or is it also that unemployed,
privately or informally employed person?

A number of citizens cited specific groups that did not have the right to the
Basic Needs Basket in the vox-pop videos like Moises, a civil servant in
Education, who [maintains that the Basket does not benefit
teachers](http://youtu.be/7_N3iRcawMM), and Anacleto, a student, who in spite
of believing the “Basic Needs Basket is a good idea” made a point of not
ignoring the many “[informal merchants](http://youtu.be/4tNbyMNnxvI)” who
would not be included.

In a comment in the newspaper Jornal @ Verdade, Vasco Muarauane, a Mozambican
citizen, [ reminded](http://www.verdade.co.mz/tema-de-
fundo/35-themadefundo/19165-sindicato-dos-trabalhadores-precisa-
se?joscclean=1#josc2592) that Article 35 of the Constitution, which refers to
the principle of equality of rights for all citizens. Muarauane added that the
“Basket” would be instituted with a “Decree with the force of Law” ****, for
ignoring Article 35, given that it
is[estimated](http://www.verdade.co.mz/economia/13469-como-sobrevivem-os-
mocambicanos-a-rasca) that more than 70% of the Mozambican population living
in rural areas would not be reached by the Basic Needs Basket.

A recent increase in salaries, which would prevent many from accessing the
Basket, was also mentioned. In a vox-pop video, Alzira Esperança, worker in a
private enterprise, says that “[the Basket is an excuse to calm people
down](http://youtu.be/axMtf6CZ6sc)” as a recent pay rise from 2.400 (within
the Basket) to 2.600 meticais would prevent many from gaining access:

The same sums were also questioned in a vox-pop by
[Isilda,](http://youtu.be/qUrlE-24HOo), who is convinced that the difference
between those who earn 2.500 and those who earn 2.600 is small and they have
the same difficulties.

Blogger Jonathan McCharty
[summarized](http://desenvolvermocambique.blogspot.com/2011/06/verdade-sobre-
cesta-basica-conclusao.html) the truth about the Basket in this way:

> Hoje podemos julgar, com certeza absoluta que, em toda a cronologia dos
> eventos, os anúncios feitos à volta da “Cesta Básica” tiveram sempre “a
> carroça à frente dos bois”!! Em nenhum momento houve um “critério de
> elegibilidade” definido!! Em nenhum momento houve um “plano de atribuição da
> cesta básica” traçado!! Em nenhum momento se sabia o que, de facto, se iria
> fazer!!

Today we can conclude, with absolute certainty, with the whole chronology of
events, the announcements made about the “Basic Needs Basket” always put “the
cart in front of the oxen”!! At no point was the “criteria of eligibility”
defined!! At no point was there a “plan to attribute the Basic Needs Basket”
laid out!! At no point was it known, really, what was would be done!!

**A crisis in context**

In 2008, after the increase in the price of bread and fuel generated unrest,
the Government of Guebuza decided to freeze prices of fuel and to subsidize
the price of wheat so that gas stations reflected the real cost for
Mozambicans and so that the price of bread would be maintained. In September
2010, the unrest worsened for the same reasons, in what become known as the
“[bread riots](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/09/21/mozambique-bread-
riots-reflections/)” [en].

What was clear to many economists was admitted by the Government in April
2011, by the Minister of Planning and Development Aiuba Cuereneia, who
[affirmed](http://www.verdade.co.mz/economia/19372-custo-de-vida-governo-nao-
tem-capacidade-para-manter-medidas-de-longo-prazo) “the Government does not
have the capacity to maintain these measures that were in place since 2008
over the long-term, to contain the cost of living, dictated by the food crisis
and world financial crisis.” The Basic Needs Basket came following this
[conclusion](http://www.averdadeonline.com/economia/18869-ineficacia-de-
aumento-salarial-ditou-introducao-da-cesta-basica) by Government, given that
it is inefficient to increase salaries of workers as this could create price
increases and corrode purchasing power.

A [briefing](http://macua.blogs.com/moambique_para_todos/2011/05/fmi-diz-que-
a-cesta-básica-deve-ser-repensada.html) by the International Monetary Fund,
via its representative in Mozambique Victor Lledó, read

> A cesta básica tenta atender a linha do sistema de protecção social básica,
> mas ao nosso ver e de vários parceiros ainda carece de refinamento e quiçá
> repensar a sua estrutura básica, dado alguns factores que podem comprometer
> a sua implementação e seus objectivos

The Basic Needs Basket tries to act along the lines of basic social
protection, but in our opinion and the opinion of other partners it still
needs refinement and perhaps a rethinking of its basic structure, given some
factors may compromise its implementation and its objectives.

Professor Manuel de Araújo, not a believer in subsidies to alleviate increases
in the cost of living,
[appeals](http://manueldearaujo.blogspot.com/2011/03/subsidios-de-transporte-
e-cesta-basica.html) to the need for a profound reflection on the impact of
their adoption

> Não quero aqui dizer que todo e qualquer subsidio e mau e que portanto não
> deve ser equacionado! Quero apenas chamar a atenção sobre as implicações e
> quiçá as distorções que os subsidios podem trazer a economia se não forem
> adequadamente equacionados!

I do not want to say here that every subsidy is bad and therefore should not
be considered! I merely want to draw attention to the implications and perhaps
distortions that subsidies can bring to the economy if they are not adequately
considered!
