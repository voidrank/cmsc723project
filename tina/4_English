The Arab world is mourning the death of Steve Jobs, Apple's visionary leader.
Tributes are pouring in via social media as netizens wake up to the news.

From Saudi Arabia, Aziz Shalan tweets [ar]:

شكراً ستيف، ماقدمتة لنا ليس منتجات ربحية، بل فرصة لتغير عالمنا #Stevejobs
#StevejobsAR

[@Azizshalan](https://twitter.com/#!/Azizshalan/status/121853872485576704):
Thank you Steve. What you gave us is not profit-based products but an
opportunity to transform our lives

> The Internet today is all about Steve Jobs. That's how influential he was.

And Shaden Fawaz, also from Egypt, adds:

> “Steve Jobs was born out of wedlock, put up for adoption at birth, dropped
> out of college, then changed the world. What's your excuse?”

From the UAE, Saleh Al Braik writes:

But if religion was not imposed into this, it wouldn't be the Middle East.

Egyptian Bassem Sabry informs us [ar]:

شخص شبه معروف على تويتر كتب تويت بيطالب المسلمين بعدم الحزن او الدعاء لستيف
جوبز لأنه غير مسلم. المهم انه كتب تلك التويت من iphone…

Someone semi-famous tweets calling on Muslims not to be sad or pray for the
soul of Steve Jobs because he is not Muslim. What is important is that he sent
his tweet from an iPhone

Dalia exclaims:

> [@Daloosh](https://twitter.com/#!/Daloosh/status/121780509012529152): Dear
> #Salafi: if you're going to tweet a fatwa against mourning Steve Jobs then
> for the love of God don't do it from an Iphone. #RIDICULOUS

For Jordanian blogger Roba Al Assi, the loss is more personal. She
[blogs](http://www.andfaraway.net/blog/2011/10/06/his-jobness-steve-a-
tribute/):

> A while ago, a friend asked me if I would ever cry over a celebrity death. I
> said, “Of course I would not”.
>
> But this morning, I woke up to the terrible news of Steve Job’s passing.
>
> And I cried.
>
> Steve wasn’t a celebrity. He was a man who changed the world.
>
> I didn’t just cry over the loss of a brilliant man. I also cried over death.
> Death by cancer. Death by liver cancer. And he was only 56. I don’t think I
> ever mentioned it here, but we lost our father three years ago to liver
> cancer as well. It was sudden. He was only 53. Another brilliant, kind man,
> lost forever.

RIP Steve Jobs.
