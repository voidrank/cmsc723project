Imad Bazzi, the Lebanese award-winning blogger, and the director of
[CyberACT](http://arabcyberact.org/), an NGO that advocates for change and
reform in the Middle East and North Africa region using social media tools,
was denied entry to Egypt on Monday, September 5, 2011.

Imad who is known on Twitter as [@TrellaLB](http://twitter.com/TrellaLB),
called some of his friends, and [tweeted from the police office in the
Egyptian airport](http://twitter.com/TrellaLB/status/110711942632587264), to
spread the message that [he has been
told](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hKltw-
bxZQVf7VV_r4j3kbC--ZKg?docId=CNG.2db02c9cd0555a1b4cc3a76310337a41.5e1) that
his name “was on a list of people banned from entering at the request of a
security apparatus,” and that he will be put on a plane back to Lebanon after
a short while.

Soon after this, users on Twitter started to wonder how such a thing can
happen in what is supposed to be post-revolution and post-Mubarak Egypt.

Human rights organizations such as [The Arab Network for Human Rights
Information](http://www.anhri.net/?p=38701) [ar] and [Samir Kassir
Eyes](http://skeyes.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/54564545646/) were worried to
hear the news.

After he returned to Lebanon, [Imad wrote about the detention experience in
Cairo airport](http://trella.org/3163) [ar]. He wrote how he never imagined
that his periodic visits to Cairo would turn out to become such adventure,
especially with his previous decision to stay and work in Cairo. He also added
how he didn't imagine that Egypt after the revolution would look much like it
was before the revolution. He then summarized the discussions he had with the
interrogators in the airport.

Until someone in civil clothes arrived along with the police, and he was so
respectful and asked me a couple of questions then left.  
The Officer: What's the reason for your back injury?  
Answer: [Disc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation).  
The Officer: Are you one of those “Facebook Youth”?  
Answer: I don't understand your question  
Well, I'll leave you for 10 minutes and will return.

Then came another officer with Imad's passport with him and started asking
more questions.

> الظابط: من هو وائل عباس ؟  
>  الجواب : صديق  
>  الضابط: و…. (لم يتمكن من قراءة الإسم فإستعان بشرطي) ومينا ذكري؟  
>  الجواب: صديق الكتروني  
>  الظابط: اي ده الفورين بوليسي مين دول؟  
>  الجواب: مجلة عالمية  
>  الظابط: ولم تمنحك جائزة؟  
>  الجواب: ليست جائزة، انما تقدير  
>  الظابط : على ماذا ؟  
>  الجواب: نشاطي الإلكتروني  
>  الظابط: هو انت من اللي بيدعموا الثورة؟  
>  الجواب: هزة بالرأس بمعنى لم افهم ما يقصد

The Officer: Who is [Wael
Abbas](https://threatened.globalvoicesonline.org/blogger/wael-abbas)?  
Answer: A friend.  
The Officer: (He couldn't read the name, so asked for a policeman's help) And
[Mina Zekri](http://twitter.com/#!/minazekri)?  
Answer: An online friend.  
The Officer: What's that [Foreign Policy](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/)? Who
are they?  
Answer: An international magazine.  
The Officer: Why did they give you an award?  
Answer: Not award, but recognition.  
The Officer: On what?  
Answer: My cyber-activity.  
The Officer: Are you one of those who support the revolution?  
Answer: I shook my head indicating that I didn't get his question.

A third interrogator came to ask Imad two more question, and they one about
his relation with [Maikel
Nabil](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/04/12/egypt-we-are-all-maikel-
nabil/), [the first blogger to be jailed since Mubarak stepped
down](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/09/07/egypt-on-maikel-
nabil-first-blogger-to-be-jailed-since-january-25/), and whom Imad had visited
earlier in prison, since he is a pacifist and Imad himself is interested in
studying pacifism.

This question made it a bit clear why Imad is banned from entering Egypt. The
Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar also [tried to find out the
reason](http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/20631) [ar] for Imad's ban from entering
Egypt.

> يكشف بزّي عن السبب الحقيقي لترحيله من مصر: «لا شكّ في أن نشاطي على الإنترنت
> أثار شكوكهم، لكن الأهم هو زيارتي للمدوّن مايكل نبيل في سجن المرج العمومي في

Imad reveals the real reason behind deporting him from Egypt: “It's obvious
that my cyber-activism is provocative to them, but the most important is my
visit to Maikel Nabil in Al-Marg prison last June.”

Finally, Imad wrote on Twitter how he is not sad, as long as the Egyptians
will be able the restore their country and their rights soon.
