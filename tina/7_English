The [2010 floods in
Pakistan](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/2010-special-
coverage/pakistan-floods-2010/) displaced millions and were a major setback
for the national economy. They affected vast areas mainly in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh and took a toll of hundreds of lives. Despite
the repeated statements from the government, no practical steps were taken to
tackle the possibility of future floods and the consequence of this gross
negligence is that floods are yet again wrecking havoc this year.

Unlike last year, [the eye of the storm this year is
Sindh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Sindh_floods) where flood waters have
razed in numerous villages and displaced millions. According to [Asian Human
Rights Commission](http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-
ART-053-2011), the loss of crops due to floods in Sindh is estimated to have
caused 5.6 billion rupees in damages. The extent of inundation can be gauged
from the fact that out of 23 districts of Sindh, 22 have been directly or
indirectly affected by the deluge.

Lamenting the utter lack of efficiency on the part of the government to tackle
the situation, the [Human Rights Commission article
states](http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-053-2011):

> It is only now that the government is examining the conditions of the bunds
> and embankments which are only just, if at all, holding the flood waters at
> bay. In the meantime hundreds ofthousands of people are trapped due to the
> flooding of the roads and it is the women and children who are suffering the
> most due to the lack of safe drinking water, milk and food. As was seen in
> the last catastrophe the response from the government was very slow due to
> the lack of a proper relief system and resources.

Like last year, a number of social initiatives have been launched to help out
the displaced flood affectees. Among these efforts is the one launched by
[Faisal Kapadia](http://deadpanthoughts.com/) and [Dr Awab
Alvi](http://teeth.com.pk/blog/), two notable social activists and bloggers
(and Global Voices authors).

Faisal, writing about the objectives of his relief efforts [states on his
blog](http://deadpanthoughts.com/2011/08/mission-badin/):

> Our plan is initially to provide them cooked meals for the next 15 days, in
> order to at least give them a chance of returning to their lives once the
> rain waters subside.

Commenting on the disaster wrecked by the floods, Faisal tells:

> Vast swathes of land on either side of the road were completely inundated
> with water. I have been working in flood relief since 2010 and I have to say
> that I have not seen this much water in my entire life. The flooding is so
> intense, that for several stretches there is no land in sight at all. In
> fact, I felt like I was driving in the middle of the sea – it was terrifying
> and saddening at the same time.

[Beena Sarwar](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/), a notable Pakistani
journalist and activist, has been actively highlighting credible relief
efforts on her blog. The groups she highlighted include [Pakistan Medical
Association](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/floods-in-sindh-
please-help-pma-to-help-the-affected/), [Indus Foundation
Trust](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/sindh-flood-appeal-indus-
foundation-trust/) and
[IRC](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/sindh-floods-update-and-
appeal-from-sadiqa-salahuddin-irc/). [A recent
post](http://beenasarwar.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/sindh-floods-update-and-
appeal-from-sadiqa-salahuddin-irc/) on floods details upon the updates from
Khairpur, a region in Sindh,

> There is no proper arrangement of medical facilities neither from Government

The most unfortunate part of the entire episode is that the media and
Pakistani blogosphere barely seems to care about the floods, at large. Of
course there are exceptions but compared to last year’s immense response,
Pakistani netizens are relatively mute.

Commenting on this apathy, [Tazeen](http://tazeen-tazeen.blogspot.com/), an
active Pakistani blogger, says in her post titled [‘South is flooded and the
rest of Pakistan does not care”](http://tazeen-
tazeen.blogspot.com/2011/09/south-is-flooded-and-rest-of-pakistan.html):

> “This year, districts in Sindh and Balochistan are affected with yet another
> flood but this time netiher the media nor the citizens are taking it as
> seriously as they did it last year…I have not seen a single camp, either in
> Rawalpindi or Islamabad, receiving donations and goods for flood relief
> efforts in Sindh and Balochistan…I find it mind numbingly cruel that parts
> of Sindh and Balochistan are submerged in water and the rest of Pakistan
> couldn’t care less. If this does not breed discontent and dissent, I would
> be most surprised.”

Currently, thousands of flood victims await food and relief. Women and
children lie under open sky, waiting for the concerned authorities to take
notice of their plight. Sadly, though, this barely seems a primary concern of
the government.

[Chowrangi](http://chowrangi.com) provides an excellent list of donor agencies
which are actively working for the relief of the flood victims. The list can
be found [here](http://www.chowrangi.com/donation-links-and-relief-resources-
