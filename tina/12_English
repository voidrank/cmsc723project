On the afternoon of September 7, 2011 an airplane carrying nearly all the
players of the [Lokomotive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokomotiv_Yaroslavl)
professional ice hockey team crashed only 500 meters after take-off near
Yaroslavl in Russia. From the 45 passengers (including international team
members from Belarus, Canada, Czech Republic, Sweden and Ukraine) only 2
survived. The plane was a
[Yak-42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-42) of the executive
charter airline [Yak-Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak-Service) and
was on its way to Belarus.

One of the first [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f18w1DZcom4) [ru]
from the scene of the crash was uploaded by migalki on YouTube. It shows the
burning remains of the plane in shallow water.

**Initial reactions**

Ice hockey is the sport of pride for Russians and is adored countrywide. This
is why the reactions to the catastrophe were even more vocal than for previous
crashes, as it was considered not only a human loss, but also a loss for
Russian hockey and Russian sport. Blogger Pilgrim-67

For many years I've been enjoying hockey. Lokomotive in any composition of
players provided me with ample enjoyment with its game. After finding out
about their deaths, I was shocked. I'm still in shock. As if someone had torn
out a part of my soul.

One of the first collections of data on the tragedy was [compiled](http://ru-
hockey.livejournal.com/1337944.html) [ru] on Livejournal by gooodvins in the
Ru-hockey community.

A touching [video statement announcing that the plane
crashed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YwWVDuLh6w) [ru] by the president of
the [Kontinental Hockey
League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontinental_Hockey_League), Alexander
Medvedev, was widely cited by the bloggers. He expressed his grief as he spoke
to team supporters in an ice hockey rink in Ufa, and suggested a minute of
silence to mourn.

Later on, Medvedev appeared again. Unable to conceal his emotions, [he
announced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kDCw3VUfk) that the first match of
the season of the Kontinental Hockey League had been cancelled.

**Russian airspace – the most dangerous in 2011**

This is the [sixth deadly
plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft#2011)
crash in Russia since January 2011, and it has incited another wave of demands
to tighten safety controls, and retire the obsolete and unsafe planes of
Russian airlines.

Damn, it's such a pity in the XXI century…. Can't f…ing government let normal

Treblaine, however, was sure it was not the question of the plane, but rather
[a mistake of the
pilot](http://drugoi.livejournal.com/3609016.html?thread=444581816#t444581816):

According to the media, it was rather the pilot's mistake. The Yak-42 is among
the most reliable in the world. Besides, it was a VIP-plane that is being
looked over on a full scale.

newworld2011,
[said](http://drugoi.livejournal.com/3609016.html?thread=444639672#t444639672)
[ru] that a pilot's mistake could be only one factor of the crash, and the
both the plane and the landing services contributed to the catastrophe.

**Whom to blame?**

The criticism immediately spilled over to political figures, mainly to [Igor
Levitin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Levitin), the minister of
transportation. He has held the seat since 2004, and his political career has
survived 15 large crashes, including [the crash of 96 senior members of the
Polish government in 2010](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/04/11/russia-

Levitin is an iron man. So many catastrophies, and yet he still has his seat.
