Following the [Bersih](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/07/09/malaysia-
bersih-rally-on-social-media/) rally on the 9 July, 2011, a group of young
Malaysians have now come forward to continue calling for free and fair
elections, calling themselves ‘Generation 709’.

The Convener of Generation 709, Lee Khai Loon, wrote in [Malaysia
Today](http://www.malaysia-
today.net/mtcolumns/letterssurat/42173-generation-709-our-beliefs-and-
purposes) that:

> 709 is the collective memory of people of all races united in making history
> in Malaysia. Generation 709 is a platform of youth concerned with politics,
> civil rights and good governance. We have converged after the historic walk
> of Jul 9, for a common goal: building our democracy.
>
> We are an independent, principled, critical platform. We do not belong to
> any political organisation, do not have any financial resources, but have
> only a heart for the idealism. We believe that democracy does not fall from
> the sky, that it takes a journey of many steps to materialise. As the
> generation of social change, we have the responsibility and duty to be at
> the forefront.
>
> We believe in the power from the united youth of all races, which will
> empower even more youth to participate in social works and defend their
> rights. It will bring a new perspective to the rakyat, to struggle together
> for a democratic Malaysia.

objectives:

> (1) Solidarity and support for all political detainees from Bersih 2.0 Rally
> and victims of police brutality, including calling for immediate release of
> six social leaders detained under Emergency Ordinance;
>
> (2) Encourage more young people to join the democratic reform, civil
> liberties and good governance through holding peaceful assembly, press
> conference, forum and innovative activities;
>
> (3) Reach out to more young people with information through active use of
> social media.

[Geronimo](http://malaysianfirstlast.blogspot.com/2011/07/july-9-exorcising-
ghost-of-may-13.html), writing from America, feels the change that is
happening:

> This generation has never seen unity until 709. In the years to come, this
> generation will look back and tell its children that this is how it went
> down. This is what gave us hope, determination and strength.
>
> Never in our lives have we ever seen a Malaysia like this before. What does
> it take to finally put the ghost of May 13 (1969) to rest forever? The
> answer lies in the events of the July 9 Bersih 2.0 rally. This generation is
> not afraid anymore. This generation looks forward to a future of unity and
> strength.

[Bryan Khoo](http://bryan-trinity.blogspot.com/2011/07/709-bersih-20-my-story-
bryan-khoo.html), who participated in the rally, feels the same way:

> I never regret for joining this rally as I am convinced that Malaysia is
> still a very good place for me and my future generation. I strongly believe
> Malaysia is still a lovely country and hope that more friends can stand up
> together to create a better future for our next generation.

The group has been very active on social media, with their latest effort being
‘Kempen Balik Bersih Kampung’ (Back to Hometown Cleaning Up Campaign), an
outreach program to rural areas urging Malaysians to go back to their
hometowns to spread the word of the call to have more democracy and justice in
the country. Among their claims are that Malaysia needs a two-party system,
the judiciary needs to be reformed and that young Malaysians who are eligible
to vote should register themselves quickly in order to have a say in politics.

On [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/GenerasiBersih709), they have already
garnered more than 3000 Likes, although on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/@generation709) that number is only almost
300.

Following that, a group of Malaysians living in America have also created a
Generation 709 there, calling themselves ‘Generation 709 in the United
States’.
