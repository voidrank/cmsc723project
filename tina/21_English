Africa has a new nation: [the Republic of South
Sudan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan). [South Sudan held a
referendum](https://globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/southern-sudan-
independence-referendum-2011/) on January 9, 2011, on whether or not it should
remain a part of Sudan as part of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement
between the Khartoum central government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement.

After voting almost unanimously (99%) for independence from the north,
Southern Sudan's formal independence was declared on 9 July, 2011.

challenges](http://www.ch16.org/2011/07/08/jubilation-and-anxiety-as-south-
sudan-is-hours-away-from-becoming-a-new-nation/) that South Sudan faces:

> However, the government will face challenges ranging from personal grievance
> to group grievances. It must address such dissatisfaction with care to
> ensure many don’t take up arms against their own government.
>
> There are still groups leaders like renegade George Athor, Abdel Bagi Ayi
> who still cry foul about government representation and structures.
> Corruption is one other issue that makes such groups move to use forceful
> means to try to achieve what they want. President Kiir must tackle this head
> on.

> A local Chief Abahala Primo also pointed at corruption as what he would like
> the government to fight. Abahala wants to see traditional leaders like him
> being given space to participate in the building of their nation.

Ugandan blogger _Rosebell Kagumire_ [believes that South Sudan has been born
at the right time]( http://rosebellkagumire.com/2011/07/08/1385/):

> South Sudan has been born at time when Africa has made substantial steps in
> development unlike the 60s. With a population that is not even half that of
> my country Uganda, South Sudan will need its neighbours who are already a
> step ahead in all sectors and am optimistic they will be a good asset. Women
> in Sudan are more than 60 percent of the population, yet 80 percent of them
> are illiterate. Empowerment of women of South Sudan will be key to the
> country improving the gloomy development indicators faster. I remember I met
> one woman on one of the trips to Sudan who said they didn’t want to be like
> women of Eritrea “who fought but in the end they were pushed out of the
> system and told their place was only in the kitchen once independence was
> declared.”

[She reflects](http://rosebellkagumire.com/2011/07/08/1385/) on her recent
trip to Juba:

> In April I was in Juba working with grassroots women leaders. Juba is a
> melting pot. It’s where East, Central Africa meets the north and horn of
> Africa. It’s one of the most diverse African capitals I have visited. My
> Boda Boda rider was a young man about 20 years old. He was born in Torit, he
> lived in Masindi in western Uganda then Kenya before finally coming back to
> Sudan. He speaks about ten languages. Language is important for integration
> and most Sudanese have spent many years living in Uganda, Kenya and
> Ethiopia. These experiences can be harnessed to bring about changes in the
> new republic. South Sudan can take advantage of the booming sectors like
> education in Uganda where graduates spend years with no job.

“[South Sudan] independence is definitely worth the 63 year wait,” [says
_Moezi Ali_](http://moezali.blogspot.com/2011/07/south-sudan-inevitable-split-
but-at.html):

> So it seems the South could have easily gained independence 63 years ago,
> but the tribal differences would've had an egregious effect on the country.
> Now however, there seems to be a sense of unification. The Southerners are
> proud to be a nation, not a tribe. Sentimentally, independence is definitely
> worth the 63 year wait.

“As we celebrate the birth of our newest nation we must remember the role that
resources have in shaping the conditions of our humanity,” says [_Phoebe
Fletcher_](http://tumeke.blogspot.com/2011/07/happy-birthday-south-
sudan.html):

> As we celebrate the birth of our newest nation, we must remember the role
> that resources have in shaping the conditions of our humanity. We must
> continue to give scrutiny to the operation of states in trading. Give a
> thought today to those people affected. The risk of conflict is precarious,
> with analysts already pointing to the underdevelopment of infrastructure in
> the South and news reports coming out of South Kordofan. Sudan will also be
> affected by the burgeoning East African food crisis affecting up to 10
> million people. Happy birthday, South Sudan: we wish you all the very best.

[_Sudanese Optimist_ points out
](http://sudaneseoptimist.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/on-secession-the-5-stages-
of-grief/)five stages of grief that citizens in North South went through after
the referendum:

> With the independence of South Sudan fast approaching, North Sudanese
> citizens are coming to terms with the biggest change in the history of their
> country. For many, supporting independence is bitter-sweet, or tinged with
> retrospective regret. Others are unconflicted and happy about independence,
> although the happiness could sometimes be a result of a ‘good riddance’
> attitude towards secession. I have observed many emotions and reactions to
> the independence of South Sudan amongst North Sudanese citizens, and based
> the following observations on the famous Kübler-Ross model for dealing with
> loss, commonly known as ‘The Five Stages of Grief.’ These observations are
> from the perspective of North Sudanese people only since I am assuming that
> the near unanimous vote for secession by South Sudan is enough proof that
> they are not considering this a cause for grief

[ Susan has no words to express her
joy](http://jamiiyakenya.blogspot.com/2011/07/south-sudan-independence.html)
and that of her fellow Kenyans for the independence of South Sudan:

> Many of us Kenyans cannot just express the joy we have for our South
> Sudanese friends who have lived with us like family for many years, they
> were like Kenyans and we got used to them. We hoped and prayed for their
> oppression to come to an end and for them to get separated, it was not
> imaginable that it would happen.
>
> After the late Dr. John Garang the founder of SPLA signed a peace agreement
> deal here in Kenya, then his sudden death there after, it was like that was
> the end of the peace deal and things would get back the way they were. At
> least there was some improvement after the power sharing deal that has
> eventually led to the separation. It is very sad Dr. John Garang is not
> alive to witness this historical event.
>
> I don’t have the words to express my joy and that of many Kenyans, after
> watching the scenes of war, the lost lives, the refugees, the effects of war
> on the victims, the lack of development and infrastructure in the south and
> the many problems they underwent.

How did we get to this historical moment? Moezali [takes us back in
history:](http://moezali.blogspot.com/2011/07/south-sudan-inevitable-split-
but-at.html)

> In the beginning of the 20th century when Sudan was under the administration
> of the British empire, many thought that the British systematically isolated
> the South from the North. In reality, the situation was more complicated
> than that.
>
> From mere observation, the British realised the differences between the
> north and south of the country in terms of physical appearance, culture and
> sociological behavior. It dawned on them that the people of the south had
> more in common with their southern neighbours, i.e. Northern Uganda, Kenya
> and Congo.
>
> But then the British also realised that despite sharing the hardships of
> their southern neighbours, the people of South Sudan were actually in a more
> dire condition. Inevitably, this lead the British – with the burden of
> history eating at their conscience – to think that uniting the north and
> south of Sudan would afford the southerners a chance for development.
>
> The north at the time was more acquainted, more developed and a product of
> conquest by various empires throughout history.
>
> This theory worked on paper.
