Communities across London woke up to a wave of destruction on Tuesday morning,
following another night of anarchic [rioting and
looting](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/09/united-kingdom-london-
burning-videos/). At least 560 people have been arrested and over 100 charged
since rioting began on Saturday, August 6, 2011. In the [most recent
developments](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2011/aug/09/london-riots-day-
four-live-blog), the violence has seen its first fatality, as a man shot in
Croydon on Monday night died after being admitted to hospital.

It has also been
[confirmed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8690855/London-riots-
Mark-Duggan-died-from-single-gunshot-to-chest-post-mortem-reveals.html) that
Mark Duggan, the man whose death last Thursday sparked the riots, did not open
fire on police before he was shot – as police first claimed – but did draw a
weapon. A post-mortem revealed that he died from a single gunshot wound to the
chest.

Earlier today, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that 16,000 police
officers will be deployed in London tonight — up from 6,000 yesterday — in an
attempt to control new outbreaks of violence. With the capital's resources
[stretched](https://twitter.com/#!/VikramDodd/status/100894640256987136),
reinforcement police are being brought in from around the country. Shops
across the capital have also been ordered to close early and board up their
storefronts.

Explosive footage of the violence has spread online relentlessly through the
day. Images circulated of looters [stealing anything

A shopkeeper in Peckham [shared](http://londonist.com/2011/08/trading-post-
special-on-the-riots-in-peckham.php) her experiences of Monday night's
violence on Londonist.com:

> As shopkeepers who live above their shop we felt in equal measures relieved
> that we were there to keep an eye on things, and terrified – for if they had
> broken into the shop what, precisely, could we have done about it? There
> came a point where I was standing behind our shop shutters, in the dark,
> with looters just one metre away. I questioned whether our shutters would
> hold. I prayed they’d move on. I hoped they wouldn’t spot me, skulking
> there, transfixed. I started shaking a little bit. To see such utter
> contempt and rage so close, on the snarling-yet-gleeful faces of the
> perpetrators, makes you question what it is that makes up a human being.

On the [Going Undergound](http://london-underground.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-
will-london-recover-from-this.html) blog, Annie Mole wrote that last night's
looting made her feel “ashamed to be a Londoner”:

> I have no solutions. I have only shock, horror and a slight edge of fear. I
> have no idea when this inexplicable behaviour will stop. I have no idea how
> it could have happened in the first place. This is a London that could
> possibly be changed forever.

More comforting news came in the form of a [mass clean-up
operation](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/09/united-kingdom-time-for-
riotcleanup-in-london/) in the capital this morning. Aided by social media
platforms such as [Facebook ](http://www.facebook.com/londoncleanup "Facebook
- Clean Up London")and [Twitter ](http://www.twitter.com/Riotcleanup "Twitter
- Clean Up London")to organise volunteers and share information, communities
across London mobilised to clean debris.

The [scenes](http://lockerz.com/s/128046736) have been ones of
[solidarity](http://twitter.com/#!/boomnoise/status/100921463141449729): this
afternoon, volunteers[ raised their brooms](http://yfrog.com/kj5oewj) in
unison at one clean-up in Clapham Junction, south London. In Peckham, locals
[stuck post-it notes](http://twitpic.com/63gc1h) to a boarded-up Poundland
shop descrbing what they love about their neighbourhood.

In between the two extremes of discord and morale, the country now finds
itself trying to make sense of the events, which have highlighted deep
tensions in the relationship between political leaders, the police and the
communities they aim to serve.

While condemnation of the violence has been widespread, many say they are
unsurprised at its occurrence, arguing that social exclusion,
disenfranchisement and tensions between police and communities in the riot
areas had been [at the boiling
point](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/08/london-riots-
brixton-editorial) for decades. On the [Huffington
Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com "Huffington Post"), Lola Adesioye
[argues](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/lola-adesioye/tottenham-riots-its-
time-_b_920542.html) that racial tensions are at the core of this exclusion:

> The underlying issues – in particular a sense that black Britons are
> routinely ill treated by the establishment, the police especially – still
> have not been resolved. Tensions between black youth and the police in the
> inner cities have not dissipated. On the contrary, suspicions are endemic.
> Black leadership is desperately lacking, and the country refuses to tackle
> these major challenges in any substantive way.

Another blogger, journalist Doug Saunders [disagrees with the
notion](http://dougsaunders.net/2011/08/londons-riots-race-politics-explosion-
futureless-youth/) that racial tension gave way to this week's violence:

> Tottenham was the site of the terrible Broadwater Farm riot of 1985, which
> also began with a protest over a police shooting – but that was another
> London, deeply divided along racial lines, with a furious and socially
> excluded Caribbean community battling an all-white and explicitly racist
> police force. This week, by contrast, both the rioters and the police are
> multicoloured.

For British writer [Kenan
Malik,](http://kenanmalik.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/five-quick-points-about-
the-riots/) this week's protestors lack a concrete political motive, unlike
those of the 1980s:

> Those [1980s] riots were a direct challenge to oppressive policing and to
> mass unemployment. They threatened the social fabric of Britain’s inner
> cities and forced the government to rethink its mechanisms of social
> control. Today’s riots may have made the Metropolitan police look inept,
> revealed politicians as out of touch and brought mayhem to some parts of
> London, Liverpool and Birmingham. But there is little sense that they pose a
> challenge to social order.

He added:

> It’s precisely because of disenfranchisement, social exclusion and wasted
> lives that these are not ‘protests’ in any meaningful sense, but a mixture
> of incoherent rage, gang thuggery and teenage mayhem.

Youth worker Symeon Brown
[opined](http://twitter.com/#!/symeonbrown/status/100635072964726784):

> @[symeonbrown](http://www.twitter.com/symeonbrown): It is true these young
> people do not have a manifesto but if their actions are not political then
> clearly we need a new word for ‘political’.

Many, including [the Deputy Prime Minister Nick
Clegg](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/7452308/Nick-Clegg-
next-government-must-not-ram-through-spending-cuts.html), predicted that the
government's controversial austerity measures were a recipe for political and
social unrest.

Writing at [Brand Republic](http://www.brandrepublic.com), Hugh Salmon
[said](http://adifferenthat.brandrepublic.com/2011/08/09/‘social-
chaos’-predicted-in-october-2010/):

> [The Coalition] have failed to look back over their shoulders and consider
> the people the cuts affect.
>
> And, because they don’t understand people, and have no feeling for how human
> beings behave, they have failed to realise that if you cut jobs and, at the
> same time, you cut benefits then you create the tinderbox for the fires we
> have seen on our streets this week.
