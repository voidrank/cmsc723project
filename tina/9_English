Twitter users from across the Arab world paid tribute to the 3,000 victims of
September 11 as the world recalled the horrors committed by Al Qaeda
terrorists who flew four passenger jets into buildings in the US 10 years ago.

Saudi cartoonist Malek Nejer says September 11 is a hideous crime, no matter
who the perpetrators are.

عموماً، ١١ سبتمبر جريمة بشعه، سواء قام به مسلمين أو يهود أو حتى مجموعة كائنات
فضائية

[@Nejer](https://twitter.com/#!/Nejer/status/112889535821651968): September 11
is a hideous crime, whether it had been committed by Muslims, Jews or aliens

From Dubai, the UAE, _AbstruseArif_ notes:

From Bahrain, blogger Mohammed Al Maskati or emoodz, tweets:

Saudi dentist Nouf Abdulrahman blames Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden for the
deaths of the September 11 victims, as well as those of both Iraq and
Afghanistan – wars the US entered as part of its war on terror.

She tweets:

ضحايا العراق و افغانستان انا احمل بن لادن – لا رحمه الله – دمائهم و دموع
أهاليهم وليس ضحايا امريكا فقط #sept11

[@Dr_Nouf:](https://twitter.com/#!/Dr_Nouf/status/112865481442066432) I blame
Osama bin Laden – may his soul not rest in peace – for the blood of the
victims of Iraq and Afghanistan and the tears of their families, and not only
the American victims

For Saud Al Sheikh, from Saudi Arabia, the remembrance brings up memories of
other atrocities. He tweets:

>
> [@SAMAlsheikh](https://twitter.com/#!/SAMAlsheikh/status/112927447871258624):
> You remember 911 yet you don't remember the massacre of 8000+ muslims in
> bosnia.

>
> [@SAMAlsheikh](https://twitter.com/#!/SAMAlsheikh/status/112927538086555649):
> You remember 911 but you don't remember an estimated 2million palestinians
> killed since 1948

From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, AhmadOTB makes a similar observation:

> [@AhmadOTB](https://twitter.com/#!/ahmadOTB/status/112930912286670849): It's
> 9/11 in the states but it's 24/7 in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan

And Nora Al Ashaikh, also from Saudi Arabia, adds:

> [@Neeart](https://twitter.com/#!/Neeart/status/112904271049134080): I'm so
> sorry that some people died in 9/11 but it's happening every day in middle
> east, people are dying every day…

Fellow Saudi, Haneen Baitalmal is, however, appalled with the lack of
consideration from some people. She notes:

> [@HaneenBa](https://twitter.com/#!/HaneenBa/status/112742447410462720): I
> truly can't understand people who say 9/11 is overrated. Have some mercy in
> you for gods sake!

And last but not least, Dubai-based journalist Tom Gara observes:

> [  
>  @tomgara](https://twitter.com/#!/tomgara/status/112876063218073600): In the
> ten years it has taken to almost build a new World Trade Centre, Dubai
> basically built Dubai.
