Iranian citizens continue to[ follow recent developments in
Libya](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/22/iran-tonight-the-islamic-
regimes-generals-will-have-nightmares/) with great interest, and are flooding
cyberspace with comments, posts and tweets.

While some Iranian officials and diplomats are calling Libya's revolution, “an
Islamic awakening,” Iranian blogger _Bedone Onvan_ has
[published](http://akharinseda.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/lybia/) a photo of an
anti-Qaddafi rebel kissing a US flag, with the ironic caption: “Islamic
awakening!”

The blogger adds, “Of course, this was before civil war broke out in the
country.” In another post, _Bamdadi_ [says](http://bamdadi.com/2011/08/22/we-
and-libya/) [fa]:

> They are surely joking. The countries who bombed Libya did not believe that.
> What freedom? You would be very naive to believe it… freedom should have at
