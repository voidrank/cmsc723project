[News](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/business/steve-jobs-of-apple-dies-
at-56.html?pagewanted=all) of [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) co-founder [Steve
Jobs’ death](http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/) yesterday made techies
everywhere pause, reflect, and maybe treat their
[Macs](http://www.apple.com/mac/), [iPods](http://www.apple.com/ipod/),
[iPhones](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and
[iPads](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) with more than the usual reverence. The
death of this visionary leader, who helped transform not only the computing
industry, but also the way in which consumers experienced digital media and
communications, has left a gaping hole in the world of technology.

Caribbean bloggers [took the opportunity to say “thank
you”](http://barbadosfreepress.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/goodbye-steve-and-
thank-you/) and talk about [the
role](http://globewriter.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/rip-steve-jobs/) that Jobs –
and the company he helped revolutionize – played in their lives.

Jamaican diaspora litblogger [Geoffrey
Philp](http://geoffreyphilp.blogspot.com/2011/10/thank-you-steve-jobs.html)
reminisced about his first [Apple
IIe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe):

> Back then, the choices were limited to clunky PCs with Microsoft technology,
> Commodores, and Ataris. I chose the IIe because it felt right. It was user
> friendly and I didn't have to remember complex codes for commands, as if I
> was some postgraduate math major. All I had to do was point, click, and
> begin.
>
> It was that easy. Steve Jobs, it seemed, had created a computer just for me.
> Or that was how it felt.

He went on to explain how that one little computer did so much more than make
his professional life easier:

> At the heart of Apple products is the desire to communicate and to make our
> sensory lives as rich and layered as possible. And the complex engineering
> is always expressed in elegant, user-friendly devices that follow the
> intuitive contours of our minds. Steve Jobs has transformed the inhuman
> integers of 0s and 1s into a humane language that all of us can understand.
>
> This has practical implications in our world. If we stopped thinking about
> “just the numbers” and more about what they meant–the values– then we would
> see the human faces behind our 9% unemployment rate: brothers and sisters
> who are looking for work so that they can feed their families, keep a roof
> over their heads, and maintain their dignity.
>
> Steve Jobs wanted us to think about our world and the ways that we can make
> it better through our individual experience.
>
> Thank you, Steve Jobs. You have expanded the possibilities of my life and
> the lives of my children.
>
> One Love.

At Translating Cuba, a site that regularly posts English translations of Cuban
blogs, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo paid tribute to the late Apple chairman in a
post entitled [“jobsless”](http://translatingcuba.com/?p=12065), noting:

> The day-to-day operation of TranslatingCuba.com and HemosOido.com is
> accomplished on an iMac and a Macbook.

[Babalu](http://babalublog.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-1955-2011/) blog also
weighed in:

> There are very few people outside of my family that I can say have had a
> positive effect on me. One man and his singular vision revolutionized not
> one but several industries. His technological vision was such that from
> kernels of ideas he created the first personal computer, created a computer
> with a graphical user interface, practically invented the digital publishing
> industry along with Adobe and Aldus, changed the way we listen to music, buy
> it, interact with it. And, he gave us the best damn smartphone ever
> developed. I am sitting here, writing this on one iteration of that
> computer, my iMac, and next to it are my iPhone, my Apple router, my iPad,
> and my iPod. They just work. Thanks to Steve.

The post continued:

> Jobs was a genius, no doubt, but his kind of genius is not the E=MC2 kind;
> his is the evolutionary kind whose life's work, when taken in toto, amounts
> to a greatness few ever achieve, a greatness that touches so many lives with
> positive energy and delight. My generation has just lost its luminary.

From the Dominican Republic, [Bracuta](http://www.bracuta.com/2011/10/rip-
steve-jobs.html) said:

> You changed the way we worked, played games, listened to music and spoke on
> the phone. You changed our world in so many ways it is impossible to
> describe. You believed in your dreams and made us dream with you.
>
> In one phrase, you made us think different.
>
> Godspeed, Steve.

Eloquent words from Caribbean netizens whose lives – real and virtual – were
transformed by Steve Jobs and his innovative, user-friendly products – yet,
Trini Like Salt managed to sum up the feelings of the regional blogosphere in
a post that contained nothing more than a headline. Jobs would probably have
loved the simplicity of it:
