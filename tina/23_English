International ‘hacktivist’ group Anonymous, responsible for many hacks of
prominent websites around the world, has carried through on its[
threat](http://www.malaysiandigest.com/news/25054-hacker-group-threatens-to-
attack-msian-govt-portal.html) to
[attack](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/hackers-attack-
six-government-sites/) the Malaysian government’s main website
[www.malaysia.gov.my](http://www.malaysia.gov.my) over the government’s
proposed censoring of several file sharing websites, including the Pirate Bay
and Megaupload.

A few days ago, the group posted a [YouTube
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6BHYPqmDyyM)
about its intentions to carry out the attacks at 3.30am (local time) on
Thursday.

At least 50 other government websites were attacked, including the state of
Sabah’s [tourism](http://www.sabahtourism.com/) website, and the [Tourism
Malaysia](http://www.tourmalaysia.gov.my/) website. The websites of the [Royal
Malaysian Police](http://www.rmp.gov.my/), the [Malaysian
Parliament](http://www.parlimen.gov.my/), the [Ministry of
Finance](http://www.treasury.gov.my/) as well as the [Ministry of Culture,
Arts and Tourism](http://www.mocat.gov.my/), which were restored before 9 am
(local time).

[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/search/operation%20malaysia) has been abuzz
with conversations, with many Malaysians finding the incident amusing. [Adi
Adzfar ](http://twitter.com/#!/adi_adzfar)tweeted:

> Operation Malaysia; legit! Hackers are cool

[Shawn Loong](http://twitter.com/#!/shawnloong) tweeted:

> Operation Malaysia- Get your popcorns ready! It’s going live at 3.30am!

[Aida Ghafar](http://twitter.com/#!/aidaghafar) showed her scepticism in the
government’s ability to track down Anonymous, comparing it to the recent
[acid-splasher](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/05/18/malaysia-tweets-on-
the-acid-splasher/) criminal that has yet to be arrested:

> Cops want to track down who anon is? They can’t even track down one acid
> splasher!

[Zarul Shahrin](http://twitter.com/#!/zarulshahrin) expressed caution:

> I hope Malaysians who got involved with Operation Malaysia know what they
> are doing- Hopefully won’t get escorted to jail after the thrill

[KahMun](http://twitter.com/#!/carmonth), too, expressed her doubts on the
motives of the attack:

> The name Operation Malaysia sounds noble, but will the outcome benefit us
> all?

Before the attacks, Crankster
[blogged](http://crankshafted.blogspot.com/2011/06/anonymous-unleashes-
operation-malaysia.html) that he hopes that the attacks would be successful:

> I support the effort by Anonymous in hacking into the official portal and
> dishing out a denial of service (meaning that no one can access that site).
>
> However, I can't see it being a big deal. I don't think many people log on
> to that site anyway!

Online news portal _Malaysiakini_ also[
reported](http://malaysiakini.com/news/167090) that some user data from the
Sabah tourism website have been compromised:

> Despite the police assurance that no data has been compromised in the
> attacks on government websites last night, a set of user data allegedly
> leaked from Sabah tourism official website has been published over the
> Internet.  
>  
> A posting on a free anonymous web hosting portal, has exposed the data of
> 392 user accounts. The details include user email, user name, first and last
> name, as well as their encrypted passwords.  
>  
>  The portal claimed that more than 3,456 accounts are at risk but had
> released details of only 392 so far.
