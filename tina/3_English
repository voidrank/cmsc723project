As news of the fall of Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi lit up the web, the
Zimbabwean blogosphere was not left behind. Rumours have been circulating
online that the man deposed after four decades in power [is in
Zimbabwe](http://newsdzezimbabwe.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/gaddafi-in-harare/).

NewDZE [reported:](http://newsdzezimbabwe.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/gaddafi-in-
harare/)

> FUGITIVE tyrant Colonel Gaddafi fled to Zimbabwe in a jet provided by its
> hated president Robert Mugabe, it was claimed last night.
>
> Mugabe’s political rivals said their spies witnessed Gaddafi’s arrival on a
> Zimbabwe Air Force jet at the Suri-Suri airbase shortly after 1am on
> Wednesday.
>
> He was then whisked away to a mansion in the capital Harare’s Gunninghill
> suburb.
>
> And nearby roads were sealed off by Zimbabwean troops and plain-clothes
> police officers, it was claimed.
>
> A spokesman for the opposition MDC Veterans party added: “There’s now no

> Eyewitness reports say riot police have taken over Africa Unity Square in a

[Kubatana](http://www.kubatanablogs.net/), an online community of Zimbabwean
activists, [sought reaction
](http://www.kubatanablogs.net/kubatana/?p=6661)from its mobile phone
subscribers about the fall of Gaddafi:

> Yesterday, we sent a text message to our SMS subscribers informing them
> about the breaking news in Libya: Muammar Gaddafi’s whereabouts unknown,
> sons detained, and opposition forces taking control of Tripoli. With reports
> today of a “defiant regime fightback,” the situation in Libya is clearly
> still unfolding. But Zimbabweans resonate with attempts to remove a
> strongman, decades long in power. Here are some of their responses to
> yesterday’s news:
>
> • Hope the brutal dictator will be captured alive and face trial for other
> dictators 2 wake up and realise they can b next  
>  • It is very unfortunate that dictators are incapable of reading between
> the lines of the changing times and hence become victims of political
> upheavals of our time. May he be forgiven for his hands tainted with human
> blood. We really wonder which existing dictator will give him refuge. Oh!
> Leaders never learn that they are mortals.  
>  • Mugabe must smell the coffee. The upheaval in Africa e.g. Libya is
> causing some shivers into his helpless spine.  
>  • Mugabe will never relinquish power. He committed many crimes against
> humanity.

And then

> Jubilant Libyan citizens celebrate outside the country's office in Zimbabwe,

Jones Masura at [The Zimpolitics
blog](http://spindocter.blogspot.com/2011/08/press-release-on-libyan-
revolution.html) said that Mugabe and Gaddafi are fundamentally the same:

> And this success of the Libyan Revolution comes at a very significant time
> in history. At a time when more and more people across the world are
> becoming more enlightened and more assertive in demanding their fundamental
> rights and freedoms and what it reminds us is that there is nobody who can
> stop an idea whose time has come, and no one can suppress forever the
> people's basic and common aspiration for freedom, liberty and dignity. And
> when you look at it, our situation in Zimbabwe is fundamentally the same
> with the situation in Libya. Both of us have endured a long reign of tyranny
> and terror under Mugabe and Ghadaffi respectively. And Gadhaffi and Mugabe
> are fundamentally the same.

[These are lessons ](http://spindocter.blogspot.com/2011/08/press-release-
there-is-lot-to-learn-and.html)from the Libyan revolution:

> First and foremost,the whole world has borne witness to the dignity,
> courage, resilience, tenacity and good will of the Libyan people in the face
> of an unrelenting but eventually defeated brutal tyrant.
>
> Secondly, we have learnt the power and ability of the ordinary people to
> fight back and overthrow systems of oppression and tyranny. In the face of
> mercenaries and troops which were send by Colonel Gaddafi to massacre
> civilians, we saw young men and women, the young and the old refusing to
> give in to fear, and rather decided to fight back through various ways and
> means of revolutionary resistance. We saw both educated and no educated,
> Christian and Muslim, coming together, united by our undeniable common
> humanity and a common longing for freedom, dignity and better lives, to
> fight back using whatever resources they had and that's how they were able
> to win against all odds and this has proven beyond any reasonable doubt the
> proverbial power of the people to make a change.
