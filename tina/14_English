As Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's hours are quickly running out, Twitter
users are issuing their warnings to Syrian president Bashar Al Assad to take
heed, and leave power.

Sultan Al Qassemi, from the UAE, tweets:

>
> [@SultanAlQassemi](https://twitter.com/#!/SultanAlQassemi/status/105398109198237697):
> Are you watching Bashar? You're next. #Syria

Libyan Libeeya cautions:

> All i've got to say to Assad is watch #Libya closely, ur next. #AssadLies

Picasso Kat warns:

And CBS journalist Toula Vlahou wonders:

Terrorist Donkey offers Al Assad some advice:

While Syrian Maysaloon last night tweeted:

> [@Maysaloon](https://twitter.com/#!/Maysaloon/status/105052548448256000):
> There is one man watching events in Libya very closely tonight. Bashar al

Will Assad be the fourth Arab leader in line to fall after Gaddafi, Tunisian
Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali and Egyptian Hosni Mubarak? Stay tuned for more
reactions from social media.
