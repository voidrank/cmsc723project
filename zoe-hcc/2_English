The winning “No” vote in Colombia's referendum to ratify a peace agreement
with the FARC ([Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FARC)—People's Army) [has meant
anything but the end of the
discussion](https://globalvoices.org/2016/10/06/no-to-peace-in-colombia-into-
the-deep-podcast/). The referendum took place early in October after [intense
campaigns](https://globalvoices.org/2016/09/26/animations-tv-shows-and-
personal-testimonies-help-colombians-understand-the-possible-end-of-conflict/)
promoting the peace process (“Yes”) or rejecting the treaty (“No”) divided the
country, and the results that are still being analyzed and contested.

The treaty aimed to mark the end of the [long armed
conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_conflict) between the
government of Colombia and the FARC that has endured for over 50 years. The
negotiations took place in Havana and gave way to a deal that was signed by
both parties, but was ultimately [shot down in the
referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/colombia-referendum-
rejects-peace-deal-with-farc) in which the “No” won by a margin of less than
1%.

In spite of this, indigenous groups and other communities that defended the
peace treaty took to the streets of the capital, Bogota, on October 12 to ask
for the deal to be respected. Many of them came from different regions, some
of the which have been severely affected by the armed conflict.

Among those groups were the women of the Embera Katío indigenous group wearing
yellow necklaces, colorful shirts and carrying white flowers.

Maribel Domicó was one of those indigenous people who came from the Caribbean
region to march for peace:

> Let there be peace and no more violence, no more displacement and no more
> orphan kids and no more widows because those who suffer most are women and
> children

This hasn't been the only protest in Colombia in [favor of the peace
deal](http://www.dw.com/en/thousands-march-in-support-of-colombia-peace-
deal/a-36028584). [Others](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/young-
colombians-protest-peace-deal-rejection-setting-tent-cities-n665051) have
popped up in [different cities ](http://aa.com.tr/en/world/silent-protest-in-
colombia-in-favor-of-farc-peace-deal/659273)throughout the country such Cali,
Cartagena and Medellín. The goal is to put pressure on politicians to sustain
the army’s ceasefire with the guerrillas and ink a new peace deal soon.

But the October 12 march in Bogota, called the “March of the Flowers,” [was
massive](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-peace-timochenko-
idUSKCN12C28L). About 7,000 indigenous people and Afro-Colombians from
different regions of the country protested alongside students, calling on the
political establishment to work together toward a prompt resolution.

FARC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-29693391). She said:

> I’m marching today for my siblings, for the young people and for everyone.
> I’m and I claim to the Government that peace deal signed, is a deal that has

Thousands of people wearing white shirts, holding flowers and chanting “You
are not alone” were waiting to meet the march as it arrived in downtown Bogota
close to the Plaza de Bolivar. Student activist Daniel Ortega, from the
National University of Colombia, is part of the organization Rebeldía
Estudiantil (Student Rebellion), which brought together students from
different schools to join the march:

> In these troubled days in the country, we have tried to make a call to the
> students and [other groups] to build peace out of different popular sectors
> to join this clamor and build a transition [in order to] to build a
> democratic society

Journalists and international media have been reporting on these
mobilizations, and President Juan Manuel Santos is aware of this pressure. The
day after the protest, the president tweeted:

> No renunciaré a hacer realidad el anhelo y clamor de todos los colombianos.
> No voy a traicionar la esperanza de paz
