UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta H. Fore after a drone successfully
delivered a box of vaccines in a remote island in Vanuatu on December 18.

Vanuatu, a Pacific archipelago nation of 83 islands spread along 12,189 square
kilometers, became the [first country in the
world](https://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/1852_28028.html) to use drones
for transporting vaccines to its remote communities.

Aside from the geographical challenge, only about one-third of its inhabited
islands have airfields or asphalt roads.

One in five children in Vanuatu is not fully immunized.

The drone operated by Australia's Swoop Aero took almost half an hour to cross
the 40-kilometer distance from Dillon’s Bay on the west side of Erromango
Island to the eastern coast on Cook’s Bay. Drone trials took place between
December 5 and 7.

The
[remote](https://www.facebook.com/likeunicefpacific/videos/487086731813492/)
communities along Cook’s Bay have no health center or electricity and are only
reachable by foot or small boats.

Since vaccines need to be stored under a cool temperature, they were placed in
styrofoam boxes with ice packs before being mounted on a drone.

Nurse Miriam Nampil received the drone-delivered vaccines and administered
them to 13 children and five pregnant women. One-month-old Joy Nowai, who was
given hepatitis and tuberculosis shots, became the [first
child](https://twitter.com/UNICEFPacific/status/1075608430549692416) in the
world to be injected with a vaccine that was commercially-transported by a
drone.

Nampil celebrated:

> As the journey is often long and difficult, I can only go there once a month

> more children in the remotest areas of the island.

Vanuatu and UNICEF first proposed the use of drones to improve vaccination
coverage in the country in 2017. At least 13 companies submitted their intent
to [participate](https://vanuatuindependent.com/2017/07/27/vanuatu-announces-
drone-trial-participants-to-assess-vaccine-delivery/) in the self-funded drone
trials, but logistical and financial challenges caused many to
[withdraw](http://dailypost.vu/news/drone-trials-for-vaccine-delivery-
postponed/article_6a6a56ea-09c1-57ed-903e-c5094695c0c1.html). In the end,
Vanuatu awarded three contracts to two operators which led the trials on
December 5.

Andrew Parker, chief of UNICEF Vanuatu,
[allayed](http://dailypost.vu/opinion/drones-and-
development/article_d99fedb6-7387-5cdd-9dc4-048e636be67d.htmlhttps:/www.unicef.org/press-

fears that the deployment of drones will displace health workers:

> We are not seeking to replace jobs, we are seeking to complement instead.
> Think of the nurse at the aid post level, who doesn’t have the medicines and
> therefore cannot treat a sick child. She or he will be frustrated, knowing
> what’s needed but can’t do anything about it.

The government of Vanuatu is now studying the possibility of officially
[integrating](https://vanuatuindependent.com/2018/10/30/drone-vaccine-
delivery-game-changer/) the use of drones into its health system.
