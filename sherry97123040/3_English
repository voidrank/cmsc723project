On December 26, 2018, Japan announced it would withdraw from the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) and resume commercial whaling in July 2019. Although
this latest move will see Japan as one of the few countries to officially move
against the IWC's 1982 moratorium on whaling, one of the Japanese whaling
industry's biggest foes said it was
“[delighted](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/27/national/anti-
whaling-group-sea-shepherd-delighted-japans-iwc-withdrawal/#.XDKnBFxKhhE)” by
the latest news as it will allow the IWC to pass a motion establishing the
[South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary](https://iwc.int/the-south-atlantic-sanctuary)
— a move which will essentially outlaw and end whaling in the international
waters of the Southern Hemisphere.

The International Whaling Commission, an international body whose original
purpose was to regulate whaling in order to conserve whale stocks, placed a
moratorium on whaling in the world's oceans in 1982. The moratorium
[excluded](https://iwc.int/catches) some aboriginal and subsistence whaling
and the harvesting of some smaller species in coastal waters. Also excluded
from the moratorium was “[scientific whaling](https://iwc.int/permits),” which
Japan carries out mainly in the Southern Ocean around the Antarctic.

[Under its most recent research
plan](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160325-Japan-whaling-minke-
whales-Antarctica/), Japan aimed to capture 4,000 minke whales in Antarctic
waters over a twelve-year period and killed 333 during the 2016 season. Some
122 whales were killed — [potentially
illegally](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/world/asia/whales-japan.html) —
in 2018. While there is virtually no domestic demand in Japan for the meat,
until Japan pulled out of the IWC in December 2018 the purpose of the
scientific whaling was to demonstrate the viability of re-starting a
commercial whaling fishery. Organizations like Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society have long condemned Japan's research in the Southern Ocean as [a
facade to catch minke whales](https://www.seashepherd.org.au/news-and-
commentary/commentary/sea-shepherd-and-japanese-whaling.html).

Now that Japan has pledged to end its scientific whaling program, it will no
longer be covered by the IWC special research permit, thus relegating their
commercial whaling project to the coastal waters of its exclusive economic
zone (EEZ).

According to a Sea Shepherd[ news
release](https://seashepherdglobal.org/latest-news/antarctica-whaling-
ends/?fbclid=IwAR1YLIQuYHZOcDjHG8WKrwhwlXO6XPN2G3PYF7qeUJHppvVp9RZnJ5HkpIA):

Meanwhile, the governments of Australia and New Zealand
[opposed](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/12/41d5a8142600-australia-
extremely-disappointed-at-japans-iwc-withdrawal.html) Japan's decision to pull
out of the IWC, as well as its plan to restart commercial whaling.

### Commercial whaling in Japanese coastal waters to focus on three species

Japan's decision to withdraw from the IWC was triggered in part by
“[Florianopolis Declaration](http://sdg.iisd.org/news/iwc-67-amends-
aboriginal-subsistence-whaling-schedule-reaffirms-moratorium-on-commercial-
whaling/)” in September 2018, where commission members
[voted](http://enb.iisd.org/vol34/enb3402e.html) to continue the longstanding
moratorium on whaling while rejecting Japan's proposal to restart a commercial
hunt with “sustainable” catch limits of the relatively abundant minke whales
in the Antarctic.

Following the September IWC meeting and votes, Japanese government
spokesperson Suga Yoshihide issued a
[statement](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/12/18c87da25808-urgent-
japan-govt-decided-tues-to-withdraw-from-iwc-in-2019-govt-source.html) saying
that, while “scientific evidence” proves certain whale species are abundant,
the members of the IWC still focus exclusively on whale protection, refusing
to take “any tangible steps” toward facilitating a return to “sustainable
whaling,” the original goal of the organization.

As a result, Japan decided to exit the IWC by the end of 2018 and discontinue
its scientific whaling program entirely. Instead, Japan will hunt whales in
its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), [a vast amount of ocean
territory](https://japan-forward.com/yaeyama-nippo-provides-counterpoint-to-
anti-military-newspapers-in-okinawa/%C2%83v%C2%83%C2%8A%C2%83%C2%93%C2%83g-8/)
stretching far to the south of the main islands of the Japanese archipelago.

The Japanese government [said](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/japan-whales-
antarctic-1.4959103) the hunt will focus on three species, all of them baleen
whales: minke, sei and Bryde's whale. The new hunt will still continue to
follow catch limits calculated “in accordance with the method adopted by the
IWC to avoid negative impact on cetacean resources.”

Smaller species of whales including dolphins and pilot whales, which, unlike
larger cetaceans such as baleen whales, are not covered under IWC catch
guidelines, will continue to be hunted in Japan's EEZ.

Commentator Michael Cucek
[noted](https://twitter.com/MichaelTCucek/status/1078121149383421952) the
number of whales Japan kills each year could potentially decline because of a
shift in focus on hunting larger species of whales that can meet market
demand. However, Cucek also notes Japan's existing coastal fishery has
generally failed to meet established quotas, presenting the question of
whether or not pulling out of the IWC will meaningfully increase the number of
whales caught (left number is 2016 quota, right number is actual number of
whales landed):

> 3) the coastal whaling catch has been largely aspirational these last few
> years:  
>  Y2016 Quota Landed  
>  Pseudorca crassidens 20 0  
>  Berardius bairdii 66 61  
>  Globicephala macrorhynchus 72 5

Cucek also
[noted](https://twitter.com/MichaelTCucek/status/1078110264082325505) the
Japanese government announced that seven communities in Japan will participate
in the new commercial whaling plan. The cities are located up and down Japan's
Pacific seaboard, from Hokkaido to Honshu. Many of the communities, such as
Taiji, which hosts a [controversial dolphin hunt](https://japan-
forward.com/taiji-and-the-liberal-dolphin-party/), already participate to some
extent in smaller-scale whaling. One of the seven communities included in the
new plan is Shimonoseki, located on the southwestern tip of Honshu.

[Represented in the Japanese
Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaguchi_4th_district) by Prime Minister
Abe Shinzo, Shimonoseki is the headquarters of Japan's pelagic whaling fleet
and was the base of operations for the country's scientific whaling
expeditions to the seas around Antarctica.

Shimonoseki is also the home port of the [Nisshin Maru](https://www.maritime-
executive.com/editorials/japan-plans-new-whaling-mother-ship), the world's
only whaling factory ship. More than thirty years old, the Nisshin Maru [does
not conform](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/japan-plans-new-
whaling-mother-ship) with relatively recent international environmental
standards adopted for Antarctic waters and must be replaced. The sheer expense
of replacing the vessel combined with the [economic
unviability](https://twitter.com/MichaelTCucek/status/1078122539950301184) of
Japan's whaling industry may have also caused Japan to use withdrawal from IWC
as a [pretext](https://twitter.com/MichaelTCucek/status/1077807075734876160)
to pragmatically end costly, subsidized Antarctic scientific whaling.

### Pressure by conservationists made it too expensive for Japan to continue
Antarctic hunt

Sea Shepherd Conservation Society also takes credit for Japan's IWC pullout.
The conservation group has long actively opposed Japan's research whaling
activities in the Antarctic and in Japanese coastal waters. The society's
annual campaigns sparked [Whales
Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_Wars), a long-running reality
television program, and founder and CEO Paul Watson became an Interpol
“[international wanted person](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-
media/News/2012/N20120914)” because of his anti-whaling and conservation
activities.

According to Sea Shepherd:

> In 2017, the Japanese government began to invest millions of dollars in
> security efforts to prevent Sea Shepherd from engaging their fleets. These
> security measures included military-grade real-time surveillance. Although
> this prevented Sea Shepherd from returning to the Southern Ocean in 2018, it
> also placed Japan in a position of expending huge resources on continuous
> security. In other words, the cost of preventing Sea Shepherd intervention
> became very expensive.

While Sea Shepherd has claimed victory over Japanese whaling off Antarctica,
they say they will continue to fight against whaling in Japanese coastal
waters.

In an email interview with Global Voices, Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson
pledged to continue their work:

> With the whalers worldwide retreating to their own EEZ areas, we no longer
> need to intervene in pelagic waters. We will continue our opposition against
> coastal whaling. We presently have a crew in Taiji, Japan. We will continue
> to urge nations to uphold the IWC moratorium and to embargo products from
> Japan as stated in their own domestic laws.
