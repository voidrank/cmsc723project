Hungarians have been protesting in front of the Parliament building and across
Budapest since [Viktor
Orbán’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb%C3%A1n) right-wing party
passed a bill allowing employers to request 400 hours of overtime work from
employees annually as well as a bill which would make it easier to fill the
court with judges that are loyal to Orbán's party. Despite the cold weather,
protesters were out in the streets until after midnight every night — actions
which were met with police tear gas.

The Hungarian Parliament passed two important bills on Wednesday. Even though
opposition parties protested the two bills, the body dominated by the
governing right-wing conservative party Fidesz (Hungarian Civic Alliance) was
able to pass the so-called ’Slavery Law’ and [a law creating a new court
system](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/europe/hungary-courts.html).

The [newly created administrative
courts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/orban-pushes-
hungary-to-point-of-no-return-as-europe-grumbles) will be entirely separate
from the current court system. They will be overseen by the minister of
justice and rules will make it easier to fill the new court with judges loyal
to Fidesz. The administrative courts will be able to rule in politically
sensitive cases such as corruption and electoral law and freedom of assembly.

The [so-called ’Slavery
Law’](https://www.ft.com/content/a0268234-fd59-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521) will
raise the 250-hour annual cap on overtime work to 400 hours. Moreover,
employers will be able to take up to three years to pay compensation for the
overtime work.

According to the law, employees need to agree to the overtime in writing, but
protesters claim pressure from employers will leave workers with no choice but
to accept the new terms.

### The first three nights of the protests

Since the bill passed, protests have taken place in front of the Parliament,
with thousands of protesters walking around Budapest streets loudly chanting
anti-government slogans, and briefly blocking roads and bridges. Some of the
protesters returned to the Parliament building where they chanted slogans
facing riot police.

Despite the cold weather and the Friday night snow, protesters were out in the
streets until 1 or 2 a.m. every morning.

Unlike protests in previous years, police used tear gas during the
demonstrations which angered protesters.

Demonstrators used smoke-screen bombs, burned small handkerchiefs and
newspapers and one window of the Parliament was broken by a stone thrown by a
protester.

join the protests.
