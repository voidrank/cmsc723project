The Chinese character (kanji) “wazawai” or “sai” (災) has been named the kanji
that best symbolizes the year 2018 for Japan. The kanji is unveiled each year
at historic Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto. Screencap from [ANN News official
YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1zI5QwOXqY).

After a year of earthquakes, torrential rains, floods, typhoons and torrid
heat, the Chinese character meaning “disaster” (
[災](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%81%BD#Definitions): “wazawai” or “sai”)
was named as Japan's “2018 Kanji of the Year”. Chinese characters are known as
kanji (漢字) in Japan.

This year's kanji was selected by the [Japanese Kanji Proficiency
Society](http://www.kanken.or.jp/kanji2018/) based on the results of a
nationwide poll conducted earlier in the fall. Of the 193,214 entries
submitted from all Japan, “wazawai” received the most ballots at 20,858.

Throughout 2018, Japan endured a steady series of hammer blows, including:

  * A [massive snowfall](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/18/national/seven-eleven-store-owner-claims-chain-forced-stay-open-fukui-blizzard-union/#.XBSknHRKhhE) that all but shut down towns along the Japan Sea coast for nearly a week
  * An [earthquake in June](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Osaka_earthquake) that seriously damaged some parts of Osaka and neighboring cities
  * [Widespread deadly flooding](https://globalvoices.org/2018/07/12/questions-swirl-over-japanese-governments-response-to-deadly-unprecedented-rains/) in July after much of western Japan received incredible amounts of torrential rain that broke all historical records
  * [Record-breaking heat](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44935152) for much of the summer that resulted in dozens of deaths
  * Another [earthquake in September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hokkaido_Eastern_Iburi_earthquake), this time in southern Hokkaido, that left millions without power for up to three days and disrupted the economy of the island
  * The [strongest typhoon in 25 years](https://globalvoices.org/2018/09/11/strongest-typhoon-to-hit-japan-in-25-years-largely-forgotten-following-massive-earthquake/), which shut down Osaka's main international airport for nearly a week

[In a news
release](https://www.kanken.or.jp/kanji2018/common/data/release_kanji2018.pdf),
the Kyoto-based Japanese Kanji Proficiency Society explained that “disaster”
was a suitable symbol for 2018 in Japan because the kanji character touched
people's lives in different ways:

>
> 日本全国「災」害は、いつどこで起きるか分からないと、自助共助を重視する人が増え、防「災」の意識が高まった。多くの人が「災」害を忘れず、教訓として減「災」につなげていきたいと心に刻んだ一年

> Since, all over Japan, no one knew when calamity ( **災** 害) might strike,
> the number of people who decided to take personal responsibility for
> disaster preparedness (防 **災** ) increased. And since no one could forget
> the calamities that afflicted Japan, it was a year when many wanted to learn
> more about how to reduce the effects of natural disasters (減 **災** ).

Each December, the Kanji of the Year is announced at historic Kiyomizu-dera, a
temple and UNESCO world heritage site in Kyoto, first established 1,300 years
ago. Reverend [Mori
Seihan](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A3%AE%E6%B8%85%E7%AF%84), the chief
abbot of the temple, typically unveils the Kanji of the Year by writing it in
traditional calligraphy, captured in this video of the 2018 ceremony:

As Japan prepares for the [abdication of its current
emperor](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japanese-emperor-s-
abdication-6-things-to-know) in May 2019, thereby ending the [Heisei
Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisei_period)[ as it makes the transition
to a new
emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_imperial_transition,_2019),
the second most popular Chinese character in this year's poll was “hei” (平).
“Hei” is one of two kanji that make up “Heisei” ( **平** 成), the name of the
reign of the current Emperor of Japan, who is typically known in the rest of
the world as [Akihito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihito):
