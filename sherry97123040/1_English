**[UPDATE] April 25, 2019: The Tamil Nadu high court[lifted the
ban](https://barandbench.com/breaking-madras-hc-lifts-ban-on-tiktok-mobile-
app/) on TikTok on April 24, after hearing arguments from the company and
amici. The company says technology has been put in place that will prevent the
upload of obscene/nude content.**

Amid high tensions in India's election season, a court in the country's
southeastern state of Tamil Nadu issued an order than bans people from
downloading [TikTok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok), a hugely popular
quick video-sharing app based in China.

The court order says TikTok enables “[cultural degradation and
pornography](https://english.newstracklive.com/news/madras-hc-appeal-to-ban-
tiktok-it-encouraging-pornography-sc-nu-1005700-1.html)” and also [cites
concerns](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2147993/tik-
tok-worlds-most-popular-iphone-app-under-fire-over-lack) that young users on
the platform were putting their privacy at risk. The order also extends the
ruling to media outlets, banning them from using Tiktok footage in their
reporting.

Soon thereafter, India's information and telecommunication ministry [ordered
both Apple and Google](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-
biz/startups/features/this-is-how-tiktok-is-rewriting-the-
world/articleshow/68388009.cms) to remove TikTok from their app stores on 16
April. The companies complied, creating confusion among users.

TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance, which is expanding rapidly in
India, has [challenged](https://scroll.in/latest/919319/sc-refuses-urgent-
hearing-of-plea-challenging-madras-high-court-order-banning-tiktok-app) the
ruling. In a statement about the ruling, TikTok
[said](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/google-to-
block-tiktok-in-india/):

> We have faith in the Indian judicial system and we are optimistic about an
> outcome that would be well received by over 120 million monthly active users
> in India.

In the meantime, the 120 million users are still able to use TikTok, as the
ban [only blocks
people](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/off-app-stores-but-
millions-using-tiktok/articleshow/68948427.cms) from downloading the app.

### What are people saying about the ban?

The app, which is most popular among youngsters, sparked public concern in
October 2018 when a young woman [took her own
life](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-yr-old-commits-suicide-
after-being-bullied-for-dressing-up-as-a-
woman/story-8PlWvf0fMwcd72A5Tp8tBI.html) in a TikTok video, in Tamil Nadu. The
woman had been facing severe online harassment.

The app also has been [decried
for](https://www.socialsamosa.com/socialketchup/tik-tok-ban-play-store-app-
store/) allowing propagation of “pornographic and sleazy content” and has been
under fire in many countries. A [BBC
investigation](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-47813350) had found the
company had failed to suspend accounts of people sending sexual and
threatening messages to users as young as nine years old. It has also been
depicted as a fertile ground for pedophilia and users trying to lure children
with holiday promises.

With regards to suicide, Tamil Nadu's IT minister M Manikandan earlier this
year agreed with the claims the app encouraged pornography and
[degraded](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tik-tok-causing-cultural-
degeneration-tamil-nadu-minister-calls-for-ban-on-chinese-video-app/story-
IPBcJtITxHgmFhRe4qhfLO.html) Indian culture. But many [users
say](https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2019/04/11/ban-on-tiktok-app-
would-harm-free-speech-chinas-bytedance-tells-indias-supreme-court/) the rule
has negative implications for free speech.

The Software Freedom Law Centre in New Delhi
[concurred](https://sflc.in/madras-high-court-bans-downloading-tiktok), noting
that the court's order “violates the fundamental right of free speech as
enshrined under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.” It also called
the accompanying media ban “classic example of judicial pre-censorship.”

Expressing concern about the ban, local feminist news portal
[SheThePeople](https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/tiktok-app-women-stars-india)
highlighted a few prominent women TikTok users who had gained notoriety using
the app.

With China's poor human rights record and strict limitations of free speech,
other users criticized the company's request from India's apex court seeking
withdrawal of the ban.

### How will the ban affect TikTok worldwide?

TikTok, formerly known as Musical.ly, is has one of the world's fastest-
growing user bases platforms, with 500 million users globally. Here's what a
report from Statista shows about [TikTok's user
base](https://www.statista.com/chart/16939/tiktok-app-downloads/):

For the platform, this is the latest setback after it was
[banned](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/bangladesh-
blocks-20000-websites-anti-porn-war-190219155030486.html) in Bangladesh and
recently also handed its [largest-ever fine in a US
case](https://www.malaymail.com/news/tech-gadgets/2019/02/28/tiktok-app-fined-
in-us-for-illegally-gathering-childrens-data/1727652) for illegally gathering
children's data. It had accepted to pay $5.7 million and implement new child
protection measures.

While Tik Tok users, Internet freedom advocates and all those affected by the
ban wait for the Madras High Court's [next
hearing](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-
to-hear-plea-on-april-22/article26844856.ece) on April 24, the whole debate
highlights the need for more public discourse on cyber law and complex
internet freedom issues.
