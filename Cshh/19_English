I am excited to join Global Voices Online Middle East and North Africa team
and will be happy to cover the Syrian blogsphere alongside _[Yazan
Badran](https://www.globalvoicesonline.org/author/yazan-badran/)_. GVO is one
of my favorite websites and I am happy to be part of its [Global Voices
Advocacy](https://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/) and [Lingua
Arabic](https://ar.globalvoicesonline.org/) projects as well. I hope my posts
would be fairly representative to both of the Syrian bloggers and to their
readers.

[_Yaman Salahi_](http://www.yamansalahi.com/), an undergrad student of UC
Berkeley and an active member of _[Students for Justice in
Palestine](http://www.calsjp.org/)_ club there, has posted a series of
reactions to the club's die-in protest that took place on campus few days ago
in solidarity with the 116 Palestinians killed by the Israeli army. You can
view pictures of the die-in protest on

_[The Daily Californian's](http://www.dailycal.org/)_ covered the die-in
protest publishing [this photo and these
words](http://www.dailycal.org/article/100717/feature_photo):

_Yaman_ criticized the newspaper's tagging of the protest as “stand[ing]
against conflict” and addressed the newspaper as
[follows](http://www.yamansalahi.com/2008/03/04/absurdities/the-daily-cal-
sterilizes-the-news/):

> Actually, Daily Cal, yesterday [3rd of March] students participated in a
> die-in in solidarity with the 116 Palestinians that the Israeli army killed
> over the weekend in Gaza. We did not stand against “conflict,” but the
> Israeli occupation. Can you say those words, or is that a little too
> informative?

One of the commentators disapproved of _Yaman's_ use of the word ‘occupation’
and thus accused him of being “anti-semetic.”

_Allison_ , another commentator, responded to this accusation as follows:

> Calling Yaman an anti-Semite and assuming he finds Haifa and Tel Aviv to be
> occupied is really low. There is nothing in what he has written that would
> suggest those were the things he was thinking or intending. If so he would
> have been involved in a great big “free occupied haifa and tel aviv”
> demonstration where he would announce himself as a Jew-hater. The reality is
> that the demonstration was to recognize the loss of life that has occurred
> due to the excessive, unequal use of force by Israel, on Palestinians. You
> only jump to those conclusions as an attempt to discredit him and show him
> to have violent intentions. Those are your words, not his, he is talking
> about a government sanctioned military occupation over a civilian
> population, not irrationally hating or wishing harm to Jews.
>
> 116 people died in the past few days and that pains us; we lay on the ground
> to grieve, we lay on the ground out of compassion for human life. None of
> which is anti-semetic.

[In another post](http://www.yamansalahi.com/2008/03/04/absurdities/tikvah-
students-for-israels-false-hope/), _Yaman_ writes about a counter-protest to
the die-in protest held by [HaTikva: Students for
Israel](http://tikvahsfi.blogspot.com/). He notes:

> Their counter-protest consisted of a sign displayed ahead of our protest
> that read, “Victims of Palestinian Terror,” meant to confuse passers-by as
> to the purpose of our action.

_Yaman_ expresses his worries of the students group's rhetoric when they
ignore the civilian deaths of the Palestinian side, categorizing all of the
dead under “terrorists”:

> [According to
> B’tselem](http://www.btselem.org/english/Press_Releases/20080303.asp) on
> March 3 (before the death toll rose by another dozen), over half of those
> killed by the Israeli military in Gaza were civilians. [According to Maan
> News](http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&ID=28113), at
> least 1/3rd were children. On the other hand, according to Tikvah …Israel
> “eliminated about 110 terrorists.”
>
> Tikvah’s message is clear: all the Palestinians killed by the Israeli
> military, be they children, be they unarmed civilians, are terrorists.
> Further, Tikvah has dehumanized Palestinians to the extent that they do not
> even die. They are not killed or murdered; they are not even casualties.
> Like pests, they are “eliminated.”

Finally, _Yaman_ concluded his post by asserting that the real issue is not
whose lives are more valuable in both sides’ deaths, but stopping the violence
is. He explains:

> To stop the violence, [step back from
> it](http://www.yamansalahi.com/2007/12/20/comment/the-cycle-of-violence/).
> Recognize the legitimate grievances of all people in Israel and Palestine.
> The United States will not solve this issue; there will be no impartial or
> neutral arbitrator or judge who will issue a verdict that all people will
> follow. Cheer-leading squads for Israel like Tikvah will do nothing that can
> even change the status quo, let alone construct a path towards resolution
> and reconciliation. It is up to us to escape the suffocating influence of
> state narratives and to create opportunities and possibilities for the
> future with our own hands.
