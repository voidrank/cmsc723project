“As hundreds of thousands protesters fill the streets of Tehran and other
provincial centers, one can’t help think that we’ve seen this all before,”
[writes](http://seansrussiablog.org/2009/06/19/irans-green-revolution-in-
russia/) Sean Guillory of _Sean's Russia Blog_ , comparing the events in Iran
to “the ‘colored revolutions’ in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, (the failed
attempts in) Moldova and Belarus.”
