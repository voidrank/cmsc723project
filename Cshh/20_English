Missiles have [fallen in the city of
Ashkelon](http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/703/194.html), one [directly
hitting a residential
building](http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/702/979.html), and another very
close to a public school. This is a substantial shift as
[Ashkelon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon), a major city in Israel, had
been off-limits to the Gazan missile attacks until recently. The attack,
caught the city's residents by surprise, as it has yet to [install its “color
red”

On Wednesday this week, a harsh qassam missile attack hit the south of Israel,
killing a 47-year-old student, father of four, at [the Sapir College
campus](http://www.local.co.il/ashkelon/3320/articles.htm). In response, IDF
[escalated its
attacks](http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j2f2Lbk3ibmKq6yjFxQuSYHceHZw) on
targets in Gaza, in which [ four Palestinian children were
killed](http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/703/093.html). This led to rocket
launches, hitting the city of Ashkelon. Many worried bloggers from Ashkelon
react, describing their experiences with terror and fear, within this
deteriorating situation that seems ever more hopeless:

> this is peanuts for our prime minister. And our mayor is too busy dealing

>  So what are we doing? Maybe we'll just stay in our houses and live in fear.
> Maybe we will move from Ashkelon to another place, where within 5 years
> we'll realize that rockets also fall in Tel Aviv, where our honorable

>  Did we not learn from past generations? The powerful Israel, with this
