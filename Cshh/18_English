For me the whole story of the fifth anniversary of the Iraq war can be summed
up one post. One post that says nothing about the past five years but implies
everything as well. We can talk about the lack of security, the number of
deaths, the failure of the occupation, but all this talk has become as
meaningless as glib phrases like “Collateral Damage.” What really matters is
how the war is affecting people's lives. [_Sunshine's_ life this
week](http://livesstrong.blogspot.com/2008/03/why.html) has been rocked by
death threats against her father and the deaths of friends and neighbours. She
writes of the thoughts and emotions that go through her mind:

> we were threatened by terrorists who wanted to kill my dad, I spent the

She concludes:
