Following “a notable exchange between PM Vladimir Putin and EU Commission
President José Manuel Barroso,” Robert Amsterdam
[writes](http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2009/02/barroso_confronts_putin_on_human_rights.htm):
“In my opinion, it was about time that Europe woke up to the fact that it
**_is not OK, it is not normal_** for the leadership of any country to say
nothing about the assassinations of human rights lawyers in broad daylight on
the sidewalks on their capital. We can only hope that this is the beginning of
a new dialogue and a greater interest in the plight of the Kremlin's victims,
and not the last word.”
