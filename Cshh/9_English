LJ user _sabeloff_ posts pictures of the ruined remains of a seaside [young
pioneer camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Pioneer_camp) in
[Odesa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odesa) and [shares the recent history of
the place](http://sabeloff.livejournal.com/194805.html) (RUS) – which,
unfortunately, is a rather common sight in today's Ukraine:

> The story of this land plot is more or less the following:
>
> The plot together with the camp was acquired for a large amount of money

> whose owners didn't want to observe a multi-story building instead of the
> sea out of their windows. The construction of this elite multi-story

> $150,000. In the fall, they were fine with $130,000, but the buyers lowered

Here is one of the comments to this post, by LJ user _yelpat_ :

> And the country is falling apart, and people are fleeing the country exactly
