LJ user _rusanalit_ , a popular Russian blogger known for his often
provocative posts on the Russian economy, published [this mock
manifesto](http://rusanalit.livejournal.com/723063.html) (RUS) on his blog on
June 10, noting with irony that those who attempt a critical look at Russia's
past and present are frequently labeled Russophobes by those who consider
themselves patriots, while in fact the opposite may be said to be true in many
cases:

> And I'm a Russophobe, too.
>
> That's because I write that Stalin genuinely wished to be useful to his
> country, but judging by the results of his mistakes, the fruits of his – and
> the country's – pre-war labor were lost. That is, if you are not praising
> Stalin but are trying to assess his work objectively – this makes you a
> Russophobe.
>
> Because, even though I credit Putin for the huge role he played in
> preventing the emergence of 20 Chechnyas in Russia as a result of Chechnya's
> official secession from Russia, I consider Putin USELESS AFTER CHECHNYA IN
> ALL OTHER RESPECTS. That is, if you're not licking Putin's behind but are
> trying, again, to assess his work objectively – you're a Russophobe.

> Because I don't like [[Mikhail
> Kovalchuk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kovalchuk)] and [[Gennady
> Timchenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Timchenko)] – the former
> basically robbed [[Gazprom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom)], while
> the latter just took away a few billion dollars from state companies
> [[Sibneft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibneft)] and
> [[Rosneft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosneft)] while he served as an
> intermediary in their oil trading. That is, if you straightforwardly call
> the billionaire-thieves close to the regime “thieves” – you're a Russophobe.
>
> If I don't like the fact that my country's economy is a resource-based
> economy and the government doesn't really want to change anything, is
> content with everything – then I'm a Russophobe.
>
> If you think that the duty of the state is to save lives of Russian kids
> […], and not to diminish stock market losses of foreign investors – then
> you're a Russophobe.
>
> Okay, I agree. If this is how things are, then I'm a Russophobe. Because in
> this case, Russophobe is dignified title.
>
> And who are you then?
