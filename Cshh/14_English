On May 13, 2009, a Subaru Forester car hit a pregnant woman who was crossing
the street in Moscow. She died in hospital later. The perpetrator escaped the
scene of the crime, but eye-witnesses remembered his license plate number. He
turned out to be an off-duty police officer. On May 21, he was still not
apprehended. On that day, the victim's husband, Alexey Shumm, started a blog
(RUS) to draw public attention to this tragic case and to document his
attempts to seek justice. Below are some excerpts.

The first post, written on [May 21,

comments so far:

> She was killed by that driver, she and our second unborn baby girl…  
>  That's it.
>
> Now I'm looking for an answer [to the question of] who did it. I wasn't with

> […] It turned out that the driver wasn't the car's owner. It appears that

> [Moscow's] Southern District. […]
>
> Today, on May 21, I've learned that they are again re-sending the materials
> [of the case] […] to [his “native” police station], because he was off-duty.

> It's been nine days already. The case hasn't been opened. He is free. All
> the information arrives in small drops, only after my inquiries.
>
> I'm afraid that this […] will go on and on. I don't want this to remain a

>
> I'm ready to meet and talk, if this can be of any help.

> If someone saw this accident, please write me.

> My plans now are these:

> 1\. Need a lawyer. Am meeting on Tuesday, as soon as I can, with the Public
> Verdict Fund […], they've offered assistance. Many more have written me, and
> I'd like to understand how to choose the best team. […]
>
> 2\. Need all the eye-witnesses. Will be posting leaflets in the
> neighborhood. Got a message today that a camera from the nearby parking lot
> might have recorded everything.
>
> 3\. Continue meeting with the mass media. Today were Echo of Moscow [radio
> station], [Komsomolskaya Pravda daily], RIAN [news agency]; RenTV on Monday.
> Lots of offers, not enough time.
>
> 4\. Am getting lots of letter, trying to sort everything and respond to

> trying to stay strong.

> Nika is okay, was a little sick yesterday (due to stress, I guess), today
