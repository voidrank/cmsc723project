Rich-Men/268817993230073) is a Facebook page dedicated to hooking up female
Kenyan university students under the age of 26 with rich men of any age. The

and Classic 105 as well as exclusive coverage by [Standard
Newspaper](http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000065366&story_title=uReport:%20%27Campus%20Divas%20for%20rich%20men%27%20not%20monsters%20but%20the%20society%27s%20collective%20morality),

Other netizens took to their blogs and YouTube to either condemn or support
this bold move in a predominantly conservative society. The debate about the
page has brought up issue such as social media monitoring, HIV/AIDS, religion
and African customs, opportunities for Kenyan youth, poverty, greed and peer
pressure among Kenyan university students.

According to [Kenyaforum](http://www.kenyaforum.net/?p=5801):

> The page which was created on 3rd July 2012, has already garnered 50,684
> ‘likes’ with 65,830 visitors talking about it.

Kenyanlist, a Kenyan blogger, [points
out](http://www.kenya47.com/2012/09/campus-divas-for-rich-men-facebook-
page.html) that:

> It had been thought that the pictures posted by the administrator are random
> internet images, but Kiss 100 callers yesterday confirmed that they
> recognize some of those girls as their friends.

But Solomonirush says that the page is all but a ploy by some canny netizens
to take advantage of young Kenyan students. The blogger
[reports](http://solomonirush.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/campus-divas-for-rich-
men/):

> My investigations reveal that this page, and probably others of the same
> kind, is administrated by canny people seeking to make money. They organize
> unions, by connecting the rich men to the campus girls and charge some fee
> for them to give contacts. I have also seen other pages where dating and sex
> is the subject of concern, and due to the high number of likes by the
> audience, they charge to do advertisements on the page. The cunning
> administrators expose the young students, who are willing to adventure, into
> perils of sexual abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and kidnapping.

The social media buzz about the [page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Campus-
Divas-For-Rich-Men/469428959734856) has led those opposing it to create a
Facebook group called [Anti-Campus Divas for Rich
Men](https://www.facebook.com/AntiCampusDivasForRichMen).

A Kenyan blogger, Kenya-post, [reports](http://www.kenyan-
post.com/2012/08/university-girls-looking-for-sex-online.html):

> The second group, Anti-Campus Divas for Rich Men operates on contrary
> principles of the first one. As the first preaches sex, sex, sex and cash,
> it promotes chastity and encourages young people to abstain. Whereas the
> first group rides high with over 20,000 likes in there Facebook page, the
> Anti- Campus Divas for Rich Men only has 5,000.

A number of Kenyans on Twitter have condemned hypocrisy over their reactions
and stated that Kenyans need to vote for leaders who will increase the Higher
Education Loans Board Allowance for less well off partners to be able to date
the girls:

The YouTube video below is an animation created as a reaction to the on-going
debate about the page. It was created by [moses
otieno](http://www.youtube.com/user/MsOLWAL?feature=watch) who advises campus
girls that life is supposed to be experienced in phases and it is foolish to
attempt to live through all those phases at once:

These views were echoed by netizens who tweeted their disapproval of the page:

> [@thatguydavy](https://twitter.com/thatguydavy/status/241088792927301633):

> [@mpalele](https://twitter.com/mpalelo/status/240848362436435968): The sad

KTN Kenya, a television station in Kenya, used the YouTube platform to portray
the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Campus-Divas-For-Rich-
Men/469428959734856) as a prostitution ring and campus students interviewed
say that this is nothing out of the ordinary:

[Campus Divas For Rich Men](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Campus-Divas-For-
Rich-Men/469428959734856) is so far the boldest move in discussing matters
involving Kenyan youth and sexuality openly in such a traditionally
conservative society.
