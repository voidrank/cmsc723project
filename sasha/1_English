As Japan heads to the polls this weekend to vote in a [general
election](https://globalvoices.org/2017/10/16/whats-at-stake-in-japans-snap-
election-the-countrys-peace-constitution-for-one/), the hashtag
[#超大型台風](https://twitter.com/search?q=%E8%B6%85%E5%A4%A7%E5%9E%8B%E5%8F%B0%E9%A2%A8&src=typd)
(“super typhoon”) is trending on Twitter. After a year in which [unrelenting
torrential rains](https://globalvoices.org/2017/07/07/early-typhoon-brings-
torrential-rains-and-deadly-flooding-to-japan/) have left dozens dead across
the country, Japan is bracing for a powerful [late-season
typhoon](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/best-time-to-visit-japan/) and there are
fears the election on Sunday, October 22 [will be
disrupted](https://youtu.be/zwAEAIpePgE).

The super typhoon is the 21st in the 2017 season [as recorded by the Japan
Meteorological Agency](http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-
typhoon/help/tcnames.html.en), and is known as [Typhoon
Lan](http://mashable.com/2017/10/20/super-typhoon-lan-threatens-
japan/#XLrxMTF4TOq9) in [English-language
media](http://mashable.com/2017/10/20/super-typhoon-lan-threatens-
japan/#XLrxMTF4TOq9). By early in the morning on Saturday, October 21, the
typhoon was making its way north from the Philippine Sea [towards the Japanese
archipelago](https://www.stripes.com/blogs/pacific-storm-tracker/super-
typhoon-25w-lan-23-okinawa-wind-forecast-timeline-1.492679).

A Twitter user who goes by the handle “Solo Trip to Korea”
([@韓国ひとり旅](https://twitter.com/momotaro18661)) posted an updated image of the
latest storm track, and how the menacing typhoon has affected their plans:

According to forecasts, the typhoon should make landfall [somewhere to the
southwest of Tokyo](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/), and then proceed northward
along the Pacific coastline.

“[Super-typhoon](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A3.html)” itself is a term
used for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 65 m/s (150 mph), and is the
equivalent of a strong [Saffir-Simpson category 4 or category 5
](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D1.html)hurricane in the Atlantic.

In September, two category 5 hurricanes,
[Irma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma) and
[Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria) struck Dominica, St.
Martin, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and other territories in the
Caribbean, causing significant damage and
[devastation](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/20/us/puerto-rico-one-month-
santiago/index.html). There are fears the same devastation may be in store for
Japan.

A graphic [first published by the Okinawa
Times](http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/articles/-/158726) has been shared a
number of times on Twitter, and explains just how big a super typhoon is—the
storm has the potential to cover Japan from one end to the other:

While the main impact from the typhoon is expected on Monday, October 23,
there are fears the massive storm will already [affect voter
turnout](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/10/20/national/typhoon-lan-
course-hinder-voting-approaches-okinawa/) on Sunday's election.

In this election, Japan's fledgling opposition parties need to generate all of
the voter turnout they can get. There are [two entirely new opposition
parties](https://globalvoices.org/2017/10/16/whats-at-stake-in-japans-snap-
election-the-countrys-peace-constitution-for-one/) contesting the election on
Sunday.

One of the parties, [the progressive, left-
leaning](http://satlaws.web.fc2.com/edano1003english.html) Japan
Constitutional Democracy Party, which has rocketed to [second-
place](https://twitter.com/ShingetsuNews/status/919747726824189952) in the
polls, has made a plea for potential supporters to get out and vote while they
still can:
