Is Khamis Gaddafi dead? Really really dead that is. The
[question](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/03/25/libya-is-khamis-gaddafi-
really-dead/) is still making the rounds [exactly a year after the fall
](https://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/20/libya-celebrations-as-gaddafi-
confirmed-dead/)of his father Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi.

Journalist Mary Fitzgerald tweets:

And she adds:

The LibyanYouthMovement remarks:

NPR senior strategist Andy Carvin tweets:

Meanwhile, Iyad El-Baghdadi predicts:

And Libyan AletheiaLibya comments:

Moussa Ibrahim was Gaddafi's spokesman. News reports today
[say](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20016076) he was captured in
Tarhouna, south of the capital Tripoli.

Journalist Jenan Moussa calls for reason:

> [@jenanmoussa](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/259718829050048512):
> Guys guys stop spreading rumors. I confirm that no one in #Libya can confirm
> news right now about Khamis Gaddafi

Only time will tell if Khamis Gaddafi will meet his father's fate anytime
soon.
