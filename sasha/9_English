The power of social media was once again
[affirmed](http://www.techinasia.com/twitter-movement-savekpk-moves-streets-
demonstration-corruption/) in Indonesia when internet users collectively
expressed their support to corruption investigators who are being harassed by
the police and some politicians.

Online support for the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) became an
offline campaign as netizens organized protest actions and assemblies against
a raid conducted by the police and to thwart a proposal in the Parliament to
weaken the authority of the agency.

Many people accused the police of using its coercive power to stop the KPK
from effectively conducting its probe on the corruption practices in the
bureaucracy.

The hashtag
[#SaveKPK](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23savekpk%20lang%3Aen&src=typd)
trended on twitter which demonstrated the overwhelming public opinion in favor
of the mandate of the KPK to expose corruption in the government. Another
popular hashtag is
[#dimanaSBY](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23dimanaSBY%20lang%3Aen&src=typd)
(Where is the President?) which probably forced the Indonesian leader to order
the police to go easy on the KPK. Below are some twitter messages using the
two dominant hashtags:

> [@dilakarinta](http://twitter.com/dilakarinta/status/254307673460318208)
> Have you ever imagined an actual president who's intimidated by his
> country's police chief? Well, no need to imagine no more. #SaveKPK

The [rallies](http://baliskytour.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/activists-prominent-
figures-support-kpk/) in support of KPK took place in many Indonesian cities.
[Projecting Indonesia](http://projectingindonesia.com/2012/10/08/twitter-and-
middle-class-unity-on-anti-corruption/) notes the active participation of the
middle class, including entertainment stars, in the protests:

> …we may underline one thing: the middle class becomes more articulate and
> assertive in politics.
>
> …they are part of the symbols of Indonesian middle class who now become
> active politically (even though not necessarily be part of political
> parties). At least, they have generated a wave of middle class who want to
> see the country free from corruption.

[Hardjanto

explains the two issues which sparked public outrage:

> There are two crucial issues related to the position of KPK that have
> sparked concerns among public. The first being the lawmakers intention to
> revise law No 30/ 2002 on the KPK and the second is the police's attempt to
> arrest the KPK investigator. SAVE KPK
