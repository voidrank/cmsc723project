Hundreds of thousands of people in Hong Kong took to the streets on Sunday, 9
June 2019, to stop the government from passing amendments to the existing
extradition laws – the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal
Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.

The rally started at 2:30 p.m. and it quickly paralyzed a large part of Hong
Kong island. Anna Pearce recorded the crowd near Victoria Park, the starting
place of the rally:

**Streets flooded with protesters**

The organizer of the rally, Civil Human Rights Front, estimated that there
were more than a million protesters in the rally as the scale of the protest
was larger than the [anti-national security
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches) mobilization on 1
July 2003. But the police said there were about 240,000 in the streets during
the peak of the rally. As South China Morning Post reporter Jeffie Lam put it,
Hongkongers made history today:

Protesters said the proposed amendments would make it easier for mainland
China to cause the arrest of critics, dissidents, and even journalists in Hong
Kong. They were chanting “no evil law” and calling for the city's chief
executive Carrie Lam to step down.

defend the people working in the social work sector because under China's
judicial system, those who tried to bring positive change in society would be
arrested. Another student protester believes that once the amendment is
passed, the city will cease to exist as the constitutional principle of [“One
Country Two Systems”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems)
would come to an end.

There have been several mass protests against the extradition bill. On 30
March, [about 12,000 rallied from Wanchai to
Admiralty](https://globalvoices.org/2019/04/02/hong-kong-rallies-against-
amendment-allowing-extradition-of-fugitives-to-china/) right before the
government presented the amendment bill to the legislature. One month later on
28 April, about 130,000 took to the streets demanding the scrapping of the
bill.

The series protests has caught the world's attention. Many are now monitoring
if the city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam would withdraw the controversial bill
which is scheduled for second reading in the legislative chamber this week.

The amendments were first proposed by the Hong Kong government in February to
provide further legal grounds for the Chief Executive and local courts to
handle case-by-case extradition requests from jurisdictions with no prior
agreements, specifically Taiwan and China. By citing [the murder case of a
pregnant woman in Taiwan](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-
kong/politics/article/3005942/hong-kong-man-wanted-taiwan-murder-case-could-
escape), the government claimed that amending the extradition laws was meant
to address ‘legal loophole’ that allow fugitives to escape punishment.

However, legal experts pointed out that the so-called ‘loophole’ was in
reality [a
firewall](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3012853/there-no-
loophole-hong-kongs-current-extradition-law-rather-it) to prevent crime
suspects from being handed over to mainland China where there is no fair
trial.

**Human rights defenders, journalists, NGO workers and social workers at
risk**

Various sectors have warned that if extradition requests are processed without
legislative oversight, the amendments would provide a legal basis for mainland
Chinese authorities to arrest political dissents. This concern was
[stated](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/07/hkfp-voices-hong-kongs-
extradition-law-plan-threat-human-rights-say-70-ngos-open-letter/) in an open
letter jointly signed by over 70 non-government organizations:

> Given the Chinese judiciary’s lack of independence, and other procedural
> shortcomings that often result in unfair trials, we are worried that the
> proposed changes will put at risk anyone in the territory of Hong Kong who
> has carried out work related to the Mainland, including human rights
> defenders, journalists, NGO workers and social workers, even if the person
> was outside the Mainland when the ostensible crime was committed. We are
> calling on the Hong Kong government to immediately withdraw the bill…

Instead of addressing the concerns raised by the petitioners, the [Beijing
Liaison Office met](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-
opinion/article/3005020/hong-kongs-new-extradition-law-wrong-timing-
government-bad) representatives of the local business sector and demanded them
to back the bill. At the same time, the Hong Kong government gave some
concessions to the business sector by exempting [nine white-collar
crimes](http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=206309&sid=11) in
the bill and [raising the threshold for
extradition](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/05/30/breaking-hong-kong-
security-chief-john-lee-announces-concessions-extradition-bill-pressure-pro-
beijing-camp/) from crimes punishable by three years in jail to crimes with a
seven-year prison penalty.

But on the other hand, it decided to [by-
pass](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/05/20/just-hong-kong-extradition-bill-
bypass-legislative-committee-scrutiny-govt-fast-tracks-controversial-law/) the
legislative committee-level deliberations and tabled the bill for full
legislative council discussion.

The direct intervention of the Beijing Liaison Office and the Hong Kong
government’s violation of legislative procedure have given a strong and clear
signal to the public that the amendment bill is a controversial political
decision which is far from protecting Hong Kong people’s interest.

Under the current bill, foreigners who traveled to Hong Kong could also be
handed over to mainland Chinese authorities upon extradition requests.
[Diplomats from the U.S, Canada and European
Union](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3011783/hong-kong-
leader-carrie-lam-hits-back-protest-eu-officials) have expressed a concern
about this. Against the background of the ongoing trade war between the U.S.
and China, some [are worried](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/03/07/update-
hong-kongs-extradition-law-china-crippling-human-rights-especially-
foreigners/) that the amendments would turn Hong Kong into a battlefield of
international politics:

> The intended effects of the amendments can be regarded as a mirrored
> counterpart of the legal rights utilised by the US government in Meng’s case
> [Note: the arrest of [Meng
> Wanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Wanzhou) in Canada upon the
> extradition request filed by the United State on 1 of December 2018]. If the
> amendments are passed, then any person who happens to come to Hong Kong can
> be arrested and surrendered to mainland China with the consent of a court or
> the Chief Executive, and without deliberation in the Legislative Council of
> Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong government responded by accusing the opposition of misleading
the public.

**Lawyers stage “Black March”**

But among those who have spoken out against the bill were not just opposition
politicians but also members of the professional legal sector. On 6 June, the
legal sector [staged a “black march”
](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/06/just-thousands-hong-kong-lawyers-
stage-rare-silent-black-march-controversial-extradition-bill/) against the
controversial bill. Dressed in black, about 2,500 lawyers gathered outside the
Court of Final Appeal and marched to government headquarters in silence. Prior
to the “black march”, both the BAR society and the Law society have submitted
opinions to the government demanding an extensive consultation with the legal
sector and other stakeholders.

While debate in the legislature has been muted by the Hong Kong government,
grassroots opposition voices have taken over. In the past few weeks, social
media platforms have been flooded with joint signature campaigns against the
amendments initiated by hundreds of university and secondary schools alumni
groups, Christian groups, and neighborhood associations.

Hongkongers abroad have also spoken out. [Diaspora Hong Kong communities from
at least 25
cities](https://twitter.com/Hk60740379Hk/status/1137388500335058944),
including London, New York, Berlin, Toronto, Melbourne, and Tokyo among others
also held a coordinated protest against the amendment bill.

The whole world is now watching if Carrie Lam would redraw or continue to push
through the extradition bill in Legislature this week.
