In this screen capture from Youku, smog engulfed northern China during the
October national holiday.

Heavy smog in northern China during the seven-day national holiday
[resulted](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-07/beijing-smog-closes-
highways-as-travelers-return-after-holiday.html) in the shut down of more than
30 highways and a number of airport in Beijing and its surrounding areas.

To address public grievances and frustrations, the Chinese authorities
reintroduced its three- to five-year plan to monitor air quality under the Air
Pollution Control Program, which has been unveiled earlier in September.
However, netizens are getting impatient with the situation: instead of
monitoring, why not address the root cause?

The Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention
[said](http://www.chinacdc.cn/mtdx/wdwsdxgbd/201310/t20131009_88909.htm) the
nationwide monitoring network would be built within the next three to five
years. The system will be charged with establishing correlations between air
pollution and people's heath, and the first batch of the monitoring sites, a
total of 43 and all in smog-prone provinces, will be put to work this year.

People are rather skeptical of the monitoring system. Hanlei Qiu Baoyang, who
lives in Beijing, [questioned](http://www.weibo.com/2490425730/Ad35gAGuV) on
popular Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo if the monitoring network would
really solve the air problems:

> 3-5年只是建立一个监测的。是不是还得10年去控制？对中国只能说呵呵了

> We are going to spend the next three to five years merely setting up
> monitoring [system]. Are we going to spend another ten years controlling
> [the pollution]? China, I offer no comments.

Equally skeptical is “Shenyang Jixiangzi”, a resident from China's
northeastern city of Shenyang. He

Studies have already established the negative effect of air pollution on
health. A recent [study](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/32/12936) published
by the National Academy of Sciences indicated that a person living in the
north of China has a life expectancy cut short by five and a half years
because of pollution. According to Xu Donggun, an official with the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the lingering smog in 2013 [has
affected 17
provinces](http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2013-10/08/c_117609732.htm) in
China and 600 million people – nearly half the nation's population.

To tackle the situation, the State Council [announced in
June](http://www.financialsense.com/contributors/guild/china-launches-multi-
billion-push-against-air-pollution) a set of initiatives to combat pollution,
including improvements in vehicle fuel quality, downsizing the high-polluting
industrial sectors, and a shifting toward renewable energy sources. The plan
has been consolidated into the 2013 to 2017 “Air Pollution Control Program”
released by the State Council in September 2013. The program, which will cost
1.7 trillion yuan (about 278 billion US dollars),
[set](http://news.xinhuanet.com/city/2013-10/02/c_125480510.htm) [zh] an
ambitious target to cut PM2.5, fine particles most detrimental to human lungs,
by 25 percent by 2017 in Beijing and its neighboring areas.

Back in January of this year, the US Embassy in Beijing announced on Twitter
that the PM2.5 level was “beyond index”, which means a reading above 500.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, people should avoid outdoor
activity at the levels between 301 and 500. A New York Times reporter
[compared](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/science/earth/beijing-air-
pollution-off-the-charts.html?_r=0) the over 500 record-breaking hazardous
level to an airport smokers’ lounge.

More netizens commented sarcastically about the travel chaos caused by smog
during the recent national holiday. Yaochen, a Chinese mainland actress who is
followed by 50 million Weibo users,
[wrote](http://www.weibo.com/1266321801/AcKctbcT5?mod=weibotime) in mockery:

> 国庆长假期间，北京车辆稀少，市内道路畅通，呛人雾霾依旧。”主要污染源是机动车” 的谣言不攻自破，机动车终于得以沉冤昭雪…

> During the long national holiday, there were few vehicles on the roads of

It is clear the the pollution is related with the pursuit of GDP growth,
Shanghai resident [Chai
Xiaowei](http://www.weibo.com/2176246107/Ada1hlRtZ?mod=weibotime) wrote,
spelling out the relationship between smog and the Chinese economy:

> 雾霾成常态后下的中国，汽车消费的不可阻挡，环保、医药、新能源行业趋势向好，提升行业估值。

> China, under the norm of smoggy weather, opens a straight road for car
> consumption and industries like environmental protection, medicine, new
