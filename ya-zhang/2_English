Both western media and Chinese media have been writing a lot about the [record
levels of smog ](http://www.weather.com/news/science/environment/shanghai-
china-pollution-smog-hazardous-conditions-20131206)in eastern China during the
past week. Flights have been cancelled, schools have been delayed.

On China’s social media, Weibo and WeChat users have been posting pictures of
their shrouded cities and updating the air quality index. A depressing
[infographic](http://huati.weibo.com/625464?refer=index_hot_new&filter=mining)
with ways to beat the smog was circulated on Weibo on 4 December 2013.

While China’s government uses the weather and street BBQs as excuses for the
hazy weather and shares common knowledge about how to beat the smog, outspoken
TV show host Mengfei was brave enough to
[share](http://weibo.com/1644492510/AmiCN0eJG#_rnd1386479852445) [zh] his
insights into the air pollution, a rare act at a time when Weibo has become a
dangerous place for debate and opinions since the government’s crackdown on
Big Vs. He shared the message through a screenshot to avoid being censored:

> 1 The smog is not only due to the weather, but environmental pollution, the
> government should shoulder the biggest responsibility.
>
> 2 Coal-fired power generation is the most significant source of air
> pollution and the hazy weather. But getting rid of it will slow down the
> GDP, so the local government is reluctant to do so.
>
> 3 Calling people to drive less to fight the air pollution is not nonsense,
> but it’s also a good way to distract people’s attention. America is a nation
> living on the automobile, how come they don’t have such hazy weather?
>
> 4 Those experts and officials who think street BBQs and cooking have
> increased the pollution are idiots. Fart is also pollution, why not put this
> on the list?
>
> 5 Government should take the biggest responsibility for the environmental
> disaster, when they say “everyone has responsibility”, they are trying to
> avoid their own responsibility.

The screenshot was reposted over 130,000 times and has triggered over 40,000
comments. Many netizens showed support.

Movie director Yangyi
[wrote](http://weibo.com/1644492510/AmiCN0eJG#_rnd1386488760672) [zh]:

> 面对空气污染,我们要做的不是带上面具，还是站起来说“不”。

Another netizen “Du jingwei” [called
for](http://weibo.com/3272117571/AmiFg4QmY) energy restructuring:

> 能源结构转型，提高工厂废气排放标准是唯一解决途径！

> Energy restructuring, raising emission standards for coal-fired power plants
> is the only way to solve the problem!

However, some netizens blamed greater numbers of automobiles as the main
reason for the air pollution. Journalist Jiang jing [wrote
](http://weibo.com/1496874104/Amk7G9h5G)on Weibo:

>
> 晚高峰时在街上堵着，就会发现北京的公共汽车很多都是空的或者乘客很少，跟北欧那些人口稀少的城市差不多。人们要么开车，要么坐地铁。没有鼓励绿色生活的政策，人们就会这样一边堵着，一边呼吸着毒气，一边骂政府过活。

> During rush hours in the evening, you will find many buses in Beijing are
> empty or have few passengers, just like the cities in northern Europe with
> small populations. People either drive or take the subway. There's no policy
> to encourage green living, so people keep facing traffic jams while
> breathing in toxic gas and cursing the government.
