Two Ugandan journalists and their fixer were detained in South Sudan for four
days for reportedly filming without permission in the country's capital.

The Sudanese People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) held two visiting Ugandan
journalists, Hillary Ayesiga and Justin Dralaze, and their South Sudanese
fixer and driver, Sunday David Tut. [They were released
](http://http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/South-Sudan-releases-Ugandan-
journalists/-/688334/1932736/-/7tp8qt/-/index.html)on July 31, 2013 but banned
from entering the country.

[Reporters Without Borders
](//http://www.trust.org/item/20130730173804-iutz8/)reported that the three
were arrested on the airport road in Juba on 27 July, supposedly for filming
along the road without permission. After their arrest, they were reportedly
taken to National Security Headquarters, disreputable for the appalling
conditions.

Ayesiga was on assignment in Juba for independent broadcast agency Feature
Story News (FSN) of the United States to to “cover the security and political
situation after President Salva Kiir’s decision to fire his entire cabinet on
23 July and impose a curfew in the capital,” according to Reporters Without
Borders. Tut works for the South Sudanese radio station Liberty FM.

Throughout the journalists’ detention, Ugandan journalists and media workers
took on to Twitter to send a message to South Sudan President Salva Kirr,
launching a campaign using the hashtag
[#FreeUgandaJournos](//https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeUgandaJournos&src=hash/)
to call for their release.

Rosebell Kagumire ([@RosebellK](https://twitter.com/RosebellK/)) appealed to
the Ugandan Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi to talk to the president of South
Sudan:
