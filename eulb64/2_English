Kim Kardashian takes on Tehran. Photo edited by Kevin Rothrock.

Kim Kardashian has become the Iranian state's newest enemy. Tehran made this
announcement in the wake of arrests of eight Instagram models—a campaign that
began earlier this year, when Iranian authorities launched a series of
operations they called “[Spider](https://en.iranwire.com/features/7149/).”

Accounts were blocked and the models arrested and put on trial. The most well-
known of the models on trial, Elham Arab, had appeared on a popular Iranian
television program called Honeymoon.

The case of Elham Arab and the other models has received international
attention. Her public apology was broadcast on Iranian state television, and
it's also accessible on a new Instagram account called[ Elham
Arabofficial.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFjPewpyyBn/?taken-

> “All people love beauty and fame. They would like to be seen, but it is
> important to know what price they will pay to be seen.”

#### Kim Kardashian and Instagram Are ‘Threats’ to Iranian Society

Mostafa Alizadeh, the spokesman for Iran's Organized Cyberspace Crimes Unit,
has claimed that Instagram and Kim Kardashian are conspiring to influence
Iranian society.

[IranWire reports](http://en.iranwire.com/features/7248/):

> “Ms. Kim Kardashian is a popular fashion model so Instagram’s CEO tells her,
> ‘make this native,’” Alizadeh said. “There is no doubt that financial
> support is involved as well. We are taking this very seriously.”

#### Telegram Users Respond to the Kardashian Threat

One of the images shared widely on Telegram originated in a tweet from Omid
Memarian, where he shared an image of prominent figures who have been labeled
enemies of Iran's revolution. The image begins with Uncle Sam in 1978 and ends
with Kim Kardashian in 2016.

The following cartoon also made the rounds on Telegram, showing a young man
eating ice cream. In the cartoon, his mother says she wants him to find a
wife.

![sweetie its time we found you a wife](https://globalvoices.org/wp-

> “Dear son, it's time to find you a wife.”  
>  “No I prefer Kim [a flavor of ice cream in Iran].”

Given Kim Kardashian's reputation for her ample posterior, it's perhaps no
surprise that many young Iranians have started sharing on Telegram the
following picture of a plump tomato:

![tomato](https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tomato.jpg)

> گوجه ی #کیم_کارداشیان پروژه ی #نفوذ گوجه ای یکی از ابزار های رخنه به جوانان
> توسط کارداشیانِ #جاسوس کشف شد

> #Kim_Kardashian tomato – the tomato #influence project – one of the tools to
> influence the youth discovered by the #spy Kardashian.

Another image shared widely on Telegram shows a manipulated photo featuring
Kim Kardashian, US President Barack Obama, and her husband, Kanye West. In the
photo, the color of Kardashian's sweater has been changed from the original
color. This kind of manipulation is often the work of Iran's censors. This led
many to question whether this Telegram post originated with Iranian
authorities.

The original image was shared by Kim Kardashian on Instagram:

> A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jan 30, 2015 at

Another message shared on Telegram sarcastically complains about the influence
of Kim Kardashian. The message expresses the wish that more young women would
dress like parliament member Fatemeh Alia instead of Kim Kardashian. Fatemeh
Alia is famous for her strict hejab and hardline stance.

Telegram users are also sharing a cartoon published on [IranWire
](http://en.iranwire.com/cartoons/405/)showing the Iranian version of
Godzilla: Kim Kardashian.

[![Haji send in the back up our youth are dropping like

> Haji! Haji! We need backup. Our youth are dropping like flies.

#### Iran's Cyber Army Sees All

It's tempting to laugh at the absurdity of making an enemy out of Kim
Kardashian and Instagram. It is funny. Yet, the crackdown on hair salons and
Instagram models has very real effects. It follows a pattern of control over
cultural expression and women's appearance that dates back to the start of
Iran's cultural revolution.

In the early 1980s, women were followed on the street by militia members. They
were arrested for showing a single strand of hair. At the gate to the
universities, their fingernails were checked for traces of nail polish. Guards
sniffed at them to make sure women students wore no perfume.

Women have continually pushed the limits of physical and cultural expression
in Iran. They have challenged the restrictions against them at every turn.

[Hadi Ghaemi](https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/05/fashion-models-
arrested/) of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran states:

> “This kind of stifling and intimidation will only deprive Iranians of the
> cultural and artistic vitality that is rightfully theirs and further
> alienate the country’s youth.”
>
> “The Revolutionary Guards’ assault on Iran’s fashion industry testifies to
> the fear of hardliners who try to control every aspect of people’s lives and
> squash any visible challenge to their narrow world view.”

The intention of these types of actions against young women in Iran is to
remind families of their need to control their daughters. No one is safe.
Nothing is private. There is no place for personal expression.

It's not actually a laughing matter at all.
