“Looks like she used drugs”, “Well, with those clothes”, “16 years old and
already has a child”, “She deserved it!”. Cartoon by Vitor Teixeira, shared on
the artist's Facebook page.

On a Saturday night, a 16-year-old girl left her parents’ home in a suburban
area of Rio de Janeiro and went to her boyfriend’s place. The couple was
supposed to go to a party afterwards. She remembers arriving at his house and
falling asleep, only to wake up on Sunday morning, in another house, feeling
dizzy and surrounded by armed men. She woke up, put on some clothes a man had
left lying around, and took a cab home.

Three days later, a 40-second video emerged on Twitter.

In it, she appears lying in bed naked and unconscious, while several men make
jokes and laugh. They can be heard saying, “This one got pregnant from more
than 30″.

One of the men took a selfie with her in the background and posted it to
Twitter. Others reacted to the video with similar comments.

### Victim-blaming, protests

As media started to cover the case, a wave of victim-blaming manifested itself
in comments on social media.

A Facebook page collected screenshots of some of the comments: “This wouldn’t
have happened if she had stayed at home”, read one. “If she had gone to church
instead”, read another.

Details surrounding her case, such as the fact her boyfriend and the other 32
men were drug dealers, that the party and gang rape took place in a
_[favela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favela)_ , and that the girl admitted
using drugs to the police, all helped the victim-blamers relativize their
empathy towards her.

But broad condemnation of the crime was also quick in coming.

Twitter soon blocked the profile of the man who uploaded the video. A plea,
mostly led by feminist pages, was spread across social media asking people not
to search for the video on the web.

In less than two days, the Public Attorney’s Office of Rio de Janeiro received
some [800 complaints related to the
case.](http://www.brasilpost.com.br/2016/05/26/video-estupro-
coletivo_n_10144610.html?ncid=fcbklnkbrhpmg00000004) On Friday, [four suspects
were already identified](http://noticias.r7.com/rio-de-janeiro/policia-pede-

sexta-26052016) and brought in for questioning. The girl’s boyfriend of three
years is one of them.

A massive outcry on social media targeting victim-blaming and rampant sexism
followed.

[Protests are being
scheduled](https://www.facebook.com/events/231623577219230/) across the
country for the weekend of May 28-29, as women swap their profile photos for
an image that reads “for an end to rape culture”.

### **The certainty of impunity**

If not for the rapists exhibition of their crime, the case may not have
gathered any attention at all.

But what is it that makes a criminal proudly exhibit a crime?

Silvia Chakian, a prosecutor and coordinator of a group that fights violence
against women, analysed this case in an interview with [BBC
Brasil](http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-36381694?ocid=socialflow_facebook):

> Mostra a certeza total da impunidade desses criminosos, que agem em grupo e
> que gravam e publicam a própria prova do crime que praticaram. Mostra o
> descaso pra eventuais responsabilizações, descaso com a Justiça (…) O
> (episódio) mostra que praticar crime dessa natureza é motivo de vaidade, de
> ser ostentado.

> It shows the certainty of total impunity on the part of these criminals, who
> act in a group and record and publish the proof of their own crime. It shows
> their scorn towards the prospect of accountability, scorn towards the
> Justice system […]
>
> [The episode] shows that practicing a crime of such nature is a motive to
> vanity, something to be displayed.

While rapists rely on impunity, victims know it as fact.

As journalist Mariana Varella[
recalls](https://www.facebook.com/quebrandootabu/posts/1116329308423455), in
2014, another girl was found by her parents sitting on her bed pointing a gun
to her head, after being raped by her grandfather.

Last week, a judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to a conviction.
The grandfather himself admitted to having had sexual intercourse with the
girl, but the judge believed in a narrative wherein the three women in the
same family — the girl, her mother and her grandmother — were plotting against
the man.

The most recent research on sexual violence in Brazil revealed that [every 11
minutes someone is raped
](http://www.agenciapatriciagalvao.org.br/dossie/pesquisas/9o-anuario-
brasileiro-de-seguranca-publica-forum-brasileiro-de-seguranca-publica-2015/)in
the country. According to the Annual Public Safety Report, 47,646 cases were
registered in 2014.

The same week the gang rape case of the 16-year-old in Rio happened, another
[teenage girl was raped by
](https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwimlOuRxfnMAhVF5CYKHZ0_B-

men in the northeastern state of Piauí and the case barely received national
coverage.

Coincidentally, the same day the case became public, the Minister of Education
of the current interim government [met with Brazilian
actor](https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjY-r2mzPnMAhUG4SYKHd11CAoQFgg6MAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Feducacao.uol.com.br%2Fnoticias%2F2016%2F05%2F25%2Fmendonca-

Alexandre Frota, known for boasting on national TV about how he once choked a
woman until she fainted and then proceeded to rape her, a crime for which he
never faced prosecution.

Frota has for the past year been involved in the [pro-impeachment
movement](https://globalvoices.org/2016/03/26/your-guide-to-understanding-
brazils-political-crisis/) against President Dilma Rousseff and has been a
notorious defender of measures that would prohibit “Leftist indoctrination” in
public schools.

Included in “leftist indoctrination”, according to its opponents, are lectures
and textbooks that deal with gender issues, an issue[ Frota
says](http://www.brasilpost.com.br/2016/05/25/frota-ministerio-
educacao_n_10131954.html) was bought up in the conversation with the minister.

****But the case involving the 16-year-old girl is helping erode women's
tolerance for such public displays of sexism.

As Chakian notes:

> Não tem 30 monstros juntos. Não tem patologia nisso. É uma questão cultural.
> São 30 pessoas que participaram do crime e nenhuma delas agiu para evitar
> que aquele crime acontecesse. Isso revela uma sociedade criminosa e violenta
> contra a mulher. Que enxerga que o corpo da mulher é feito para o homem
