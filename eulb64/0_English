A Valentine's Day ad depicts female friendship as feuding and catty.

A now-pulled Valentine's Day advertisement from the department store chain
LOFT is the latest in a long line of Japanese ad campaigns that have sparked
controversy online for alleged anti-women messaging.

The offending advertisement was [released on January 20 and taken down on
February 4](https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20190202-00010005-huffpost-
soci) after facing a wave of criticism on Twitter.

The advertisement's main image was a group of five blonde women clad in pink,
released with the accompanying message, “Being a girl is fun!” (女の子って楽しい!),
calling for women to celebrate the holiday with their female friends. On the
surface, the advertisement appeared to depict a group of friends enjoying
Valentine's Day together, an image that aligns with the ad copy. However, the
accompanying video (now removed from YouTube and elsewhere online) implied
something more insidious.

The video featured interactions between the friends like the following
exchange (screenshots by [IT
Media](https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1902/01/news133.html#l_ma_loft02_w490.jpg),
which reported on this story):

These interactions end abruptly with the phrase _zuttomo_ (ズッ友), a slang
abbreviation of _zutto tomodachi_ (ずっと友達) meaning “friends forever.” The use
of the phrase is implied to be ironic, considering the strained nature of the
conversations it proceeds.

The video's closing image was one of the five friends celebrating together
while remarking, “It's so nice having just us girls!”

This surface-level affirmation of the virtues of female friendship is soon
undermined, however, when the curtain pulls back to reveal the friends locked
in a petty power struggle, tugging at each other's hair and clothing, with one
girl even pulling up another's skirt.

This depiction of female friendship as feuding and catty thinly veiled by a
sugary facade rubbed more than a few people the wrong way, with some calling
the views espoused by the ad outdated and misogynistic.

## Misogynistic ad campaigns nothing new in Japan

As many Twitter users have remarked, this latest incident is reminiscent of
earlier controversies, such as the one surrounding an [ad campaign for Kirin's
Go Go Tea](https://vimeo.com/181063531).

The 2016 commercial featured illustrated caricatures of the type of women who
drink their tea, including “The Conceited Girl Who Thinks She's a Model” and
“The Girl Who Depends on Her Friends for Everything.”

The Kirin tea campaign took to Twitter with a call to retweet if you knew
anyone who fit any of the descriptions, but after a backlash from consumers
the tweets were deleted and Kirin issued an apology.

[HuffPost Japan](https://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2018/04/30/kirin-
gogotea_a_23424066/) reported:

Another ad campaign that drew similar criticism was a [commercial for
department store chain Sogo &
Seibu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=BXE2Q_gzWKM), released
in December 2018.

Starring actor Sakura Ando, the video was intended to promote gender equality,
yet it did so by [downplaying the importance of a familiar rallying cry for
greater opportunities for
women](https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/'we-don%E2%80%99t-need-
an-age-of-women-'-japanese-commercial-says-then-hits-actress-in-face-with-
cream) when it asked: “We don’t need an Age of Women, do we?”

The choice of visuals is indeed a puzzling one, as having cream pies hurled at
one's face probably isn't most people's idea of empowerment. The implication
that an “Age of Women” is unnecessary, especially in a country that [ranks
110th among 149 nations in gender
equality](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201812180056.html), is perhaps
premature.

One Twitter user has a theory about the apparent prevalence of sexist
advertising in Japan.

Others have shared a more charitable interpretation of the Sogo & Seibu ad,
seeing the plates of cream as metaphors for the challenges life throws at us
and applauding Ando's toughness as she continues moving forward.
