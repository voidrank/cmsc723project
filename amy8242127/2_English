Deserved or not, Japan has long had a reputation for being the home of [weird
and wacky vending
machines](https://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/machineheads?utm_term=.apGWEjyK0#.uoEK6joOx).
What is not as commonly understood, however, is what Japanese people think
about vending machines in other countries.

One member of Naver Matome, a popular Japanese blogging site, decided to find
out. In an post titled “[Vending Machines That Even Japanese People Are
Surprised By](https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2149285599004056901)” (日本人もびびる) —
which has been viewed several hundred thousand times already —
[vortexxx](https://matome.naver.jp/mymatome/vortexxx) collected a series of
images posted by Japanese Twitter users.

### Russia leads the pack

The first photo of a remarkable vending machine (at least from a Japanese
point of view) is from Hitoki Nakagawa, the Vladivostok bureau chief for Asahi
Shimbun, a well respected daily newspaper. The machine in his photo sells
ultra-expensive caviar:

>
> ウラジオストクに帰るため、モスクワのシェレメチボ空港にいます。気づいたのですが、キャビアの自動販売機が。今日は品切れでしたが高いもので20000ルーブル。今のレートでも4万円以上。猫には食べられませんが、こんな高額品をここで買うかな

Caviar vending machines seemed to spark interest among many Japanese social
media users. Here, someone else found a machine that sold slightly cheaper
products:

> モスクワの空港でキャビアの自販機発見。1番安いので2000ルーブル、日本円で4000円。直径5~6センチの小さいやつ。  
>  1番大きのは直径10センチくらい？値段は高すぎて忘れた(´Д` )

> ten centimeters across? I forget the price, it was too expensive. (´Д` )
>
> I didn't buy anything, just snapped a photo.

Some Japanese travelers also noticed vending machines selling patriotic
Russian kitsch:

> As a heavy user of Sheremetyevo airport I recommend checking out the
> ‘President Putin T-Shirt vending machine’.

Others remarked on how practical some of the vending machines were:

> ロシア…24時間スーパーの自販機で使い捨てコンタクト売ってるの便利すぎますわ…

> In Russia, there's a vending machine in a 24-hour supermarket that sells
> contact lenses… Super useful!

The most noteworthy vending machine of all was one that sold space food:

>
> モスクワの空港で発見。宇宙食の自販機。「ボルシチ」、「肉とソバの実」、ドライフルーツのコンポート」などのチューブ入り宇宙食が400ルーブル（＝約800円）でした。[#ロシア](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A2?src=hash)

### Unique vending machines in other countries

The Naver Matome blog post also collected a few Twitter posts of other vending
machines around the world that Japanese travelers found interesting. One
vending machine in Germany sold Lego:

> LEGOの自販機だって！ドイツいいなぁ〜(*☻-☻*) [pic.twitter.com/usigjHaq](http://t.co/usigjHaq)

> A Lego vending machine! Germany is awesome! (*☻-☻*)

Another, in Italy, provoked pangs of hunger:

> イタリアにあるピザ自動販売機のピザ食べたい。  
>  これは鬼アツ [pic.twitter.com/GjnyLRvE4m](https://t.co/GjnyLRvE4m)

> Here's a pizza vending machine in Italy! Now I want to eat pizza!

One of the most unusual vending machines, which a Japanese Twitter user
observed in the United States, sells something that can only be bought in
certain places in the country: pot.

> アメリカのシアトル市に設置された医療用マリファナを販売する自動販売機。お値段1ドルから<http://t.co/EKIuSljKku>
