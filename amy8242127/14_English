[“Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse (I
earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be
repeated).”](http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/page/okotoba/detailEn/14#92) Japanese
Emperor Akihito, with Empress Michiko, addresses Memorial Ceremony for the War
Dead on August 15, 2017. [Screencap from ANN official YouTube
channel.](https://youtu.be/XnyZaVAcAKI)

August 15 marked the 72nd anniversary of the end of the Second World War. On
the occasion, Japan remembered the 2.3 million Japanese military personnel and
military employees and 800,000 Japanese civilians who died between the start
of the [Second Sino-Japanese War in
1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War) and the end of
World War II in 1945.

Japan's annual commemoration of the end of the war shows that, seven decades
on, there is no clear political consensus in Japan about how to remember the
war. Some remember the 3.1 million dead while seeming to avoid the context of
the war in which they died, while others are committed to preserving the
memory of how destructive war can be, and the need for Japan to continue to
embrace pacifism.

More than 6,200 people attended a memorial service at the [Nippon
Budokan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Budokan) sports arena in Tokyo,
which featured remarks by Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and Japanese Emperor
Akihito. [Abe's
words](http://japan.kantei.go.jp/97_abe/statement/201708/1224077_11583.html)
were notable in that he did not express Japan's guilt for starting the war,
while the emperor expressed feelings of “deep remorse” for the war, [for the
third year in a
row](http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170815/p2a/00m/0na/017000c).

Neither made direct reference to the war dead in other countries.

Meanwhile, thousands of people traveled to [Yasukuni
Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasukuni_Shrine) and neighboring
[Chidorigafuchi National
Cemetery](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/05/30/national/remains-2337-war-
dead-added-tokyos-chidorigafuchi-cemetery/#.WZadglUjFD8) in Tokyo to pay their
respects to the war dead. Yasukuni Shrine is controversial for many people
across East Asia since the shrine memorializes, among others, [convicted
Japanese war criminals](http://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a02404/). As well,
[swords forged at Yasukuni](https://globalvoices.org/2008/03/31/japan-views-
on-yasukuni-the-movie/) were used in the battlefields across Asia between 1933
and 1945.

BuzzFeed Japan reporter Kota Hatachi reported from the scene:

Meanwhile, protesters and other groups congregated outside of Yasukuni.
[According to Sankei
Shimbun](http://www.sankei.com/life/news/170815/lif1708150035-n1.html)
newspaper, the groups were demonstrating against attempts to revise Japan's
“peace Constitution” as well raising awareness about a variety of issues, such
as Taiwanese independence.

Due to the crush of Yasukuni visitors and the sheer number of protesters and
other groups nearby, Tokyo police erected barricades to control the crowds.

Sankei Shimbun also reported that right-wing and conservative counter-
demonstrators appeared in response to Yasukuni demonstrators, prompting police
to separate the two groups.

Elsewhere in Tokyo, other groups marked the day by coming out in support of
[Article 9 of Japan's
Constitution](https://globalvoices.org/2015/07/16/despite-protests-japans-

A main theme of the day was that memories of the hardship of war appear to be
disappearing as the wartime generation ages:

The significance of the day wasn't lost on this Japanese Twitter user,
however:
