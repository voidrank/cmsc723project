Have you ever bought a book at a secondhand bookstore and found something
unexpected left inside that the previous owner used as bookmark?

If you have, you are not alone. Unusual bookmarks left in used books seems to
be a global phenomenon, and [a blog
post](https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2142631483329759301?page=2) written by
someone with the Naver Matomer username of “Outstanding Individual Talent In
28 Seconds”
([28秒に一人の逸材さん](https://matome.naver.jp/mymatome/28%E7%A7%92%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%AE%E9%80%B8%E6%9D%90))
catalogs what some of these bookmarks look like in Japan.

Many of the bookmarks, before being shared on Twitter as photographs, were
found in titles purchased at [Book
Off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Off), a nationwide chain of used
bookstores in Japan.

Other bookmarks showcased in the Naver Matome blog post are cryptic and
sometimes unsettling.

Some are more whimsical:

While others are very creative:

There are bookmarks that seem to somehow match the book they were found in:

Sometimes there are unexpected rewards to be found at Book Off:

> ブックオフで買ってきた108円均一本に4千円挟まってた。 しかし、なぜに新札と旧札？ まぁ 得した。

Or even hints at the life of the previous owner of the book.
