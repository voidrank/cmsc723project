“The basic aim of the competition is to collect photos of natural heritage
sites – such as nature reserves, landscape conservation areas, national parks,
scenic/landscape areas, remarkable gardens, etc. – to illustrate articles in
the worldwide free encyclopedia Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation
projects,” states the official announcement of the global competition.

The 2017 edition of the “Wiki Loves Earth” contest includes participants from
a total of 37 countries on five different continents. Organizers and
contributors have been using the hashtag
[#WikiLovesEarth](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WikiLovesEarth?src=hash) to
publish photos and promote a spirit of sharing.

Over 137,000 photos have been collected on a global level so far, with India,
Germany, Ukraine, Brazil and Pakistan as top contributors.
