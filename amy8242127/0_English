As the world's nations meet in Bonn, Germany for the 23rd annual conference of
the parties ([COP23](https://cop23.com.fj/)) under the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2017 is set to be one of the [hottest years on
record.](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/cop23-german-coal-scrutiny-

Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Cyprus
Institute in Nicosia have predicted a harsh fate for the [Middle East and
North Africa](https://phys.org/news/2016-05-climate-exodus-middle-east-north-
africa.html) (MENA) region. Jordan currently faces one of the most [severe
droughts](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/climate-change-jordan-water-
crisis-worse-171107093731580.html) in recorded history. In the absence of
international climate policy action, the country could receive 30 percent less
rainfall by 2100 and annual temperatures could increase by 4.5 Celsius.

The landmark[ Paris
Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php) at [COP
21](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/world-leaders-hail-
paris-climate-deal) in 2015 provided the first truly global deal to tackle
climate change. The 2017 Bonn meeting will be paramount in building the rules
to enact the Paris deal and toughen national actions to meet the goal of
keeping the global temperature rise below [2 degrees
Celsius](http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI13-IPCCinfographic-

### MENA faces massive heats waves

In October 2015, the journal _Nature Climate Change_ predicted that heat waves
in parts of the Persian Gulf could threaten [human
survival](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/an-epic-middle-
east-heat-wave-could-be-global-warmings-hellish-curtain-
raiser/2016/08/09/c8c717d4-5992-11e6-8b48-0cb344221131_story.html?utm_term=.ce05ab7f1982)
by the end of the century. Heat wave duration in the MENA region will prolong
dramatically, lasting 80 days by mid-century and 118 days by the end of the
century compared to the present average of 16 days, even if greenhouse gas
emissions decline again after 2040.

Unrestrained demand for water for agricultural purposes in the region has led
to groundwater over‐drafting, declines in water quality and land degradation
including salinization (increasing salt content in the soil).  
Climate change is expected to
[compound](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/902945/icode/) these trends
and the agriculture sector will hit the hardest. More frequent and intense
heat waves and reduced rainfall will curb growing seasons. With less rain,
there will be a reduction in soil moisture, river runoff, and aquifer
recharge. Increased uncertainty will affect productivity, and make
agricultural planning more difficult.

Jordan, for example, draws 160 percent more water from the ground than is
replenished by nature, yet there is little incentive to conserve this precious
resource.

The use of water for irrigation remains heavily and unsustainably subsidized
by the government, and wastage is a major issue. More than half of Jordan's
water is used for agriculture which only produces only a small share of the
local food supply. An estimated 50 percent of the water supply is lost due to
misuse or theft.

Egypt faces similar problems:

### Harnessing the power of sun and wind

Middle Eastern countries are paying a heavy price for their [focus on fossil
fuels](http://m.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/briefings/climate/COP22/Brief-
Energy-in-the-Arab-World.pdf?epslanguage=en-GB) in the form of air pollution
and contaminated water. Increasing
[desertification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification) has adversely
affected farming. The fishing industry suffers from deteriorating quality in
coastal waters and the negative effects of changing sea temperatures on
catches.

But fossil fuels continue to enjoy huge subsidies and are so
[underpriced](https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-
content/uploads/2014/01/MEP-6.pdf) that it is difficult for renewable energies
to break through. They are perceived as not being cost-competitive because of
the sometimes-hidden subsidies offered to fossil fuels.

Only some countries in the region have grown rich by exploiting fossil fuels
with the majority sourcing less than 1 percent of electricity from renewables.
While all MENA countries stand to benefit from the sun, and the region has
huge potential for solar energy and wind power, renewable energies investment
is among the lowest in the world. MENA falls behind similar-income countries
in this regard, but also behind many poorer countries.

### MENA braces for a future of extremes

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
([IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/)), anthropogenic climate change is already
significantly increasing the likelihood of extreme weather events like
[heatwaves](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/19/a-third-of-
the-world-now-faces-deadly-heatwaves-as-result-of-climate-change),
[floods](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/16/floods-
and-devastation-in-india-nepal-and-bangladesh-in-pictures), and [wildfires.
](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/brazil-forest-fires-
deforestation-september-record-amazon)The impact of these natural disasters
may be irreversible, severe and widespread for billions of people unless
action is taken now to drastically cut global carbon emissions.

[Over the last decade](https://www.abo.net/en_IT/topics/arab-world.shtml),
various nations have announced long and medium-term development plans for
alternative installations to fossil resources.

For example, Morocco and Jordan have been driven to diversified their energy
sources to meet a greater dependency and demand for fuel imports that continue
to increase in cost.The Moroccan government is on the verge of achieving its
objective to produce 2 Gigawatts (GW) of solar energy and 2 GW of wind energy
by 2020, whereas its current wind capacity is over 750 Megavolts (MV). The
Jordanian government is planning to increase its initial objective of 600
Megawatts (MW) of solar power to 1 GW by 2020.

Current pledges for carbon cuts by the world’s nations would mean at least [3
degrees Celcius of global warming and severe damage,
](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-
for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un)experts warn.
Without serious preparation to build trust and agreement, deals are likely to
delay, as the failed COP in Copenhagen in 2009 revealed.

While the Paris Agreement included a mechanism to review and ratchet up these
pledges, the rules have not been set, adding pressure to the Bonn meeting to
complete this vital work before 2018.
