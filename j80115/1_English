Yesterday (December 13) was the 70 year memorial of Nanjing Massacre. The
Chinese government is trying to downplay the historical issue by stressing
that they don't want to stir up hatred. Zoula[ points out
(zh)](https://www.zuola.com/weblog/?p=940) that we should know more about the
details of Nanjing Massacre, even though some of the historical fact might
hurt our feelings and reflects upon reason behind racial conflict rather than
suppression discussion.
