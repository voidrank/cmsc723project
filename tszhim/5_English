Like most Sub-Saharan Africans, Ghanians use the English language—not only as
a _lingua franca_ , but also as the official language. They use English on top
of m[any local languages—and
dialects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana#Languages)—spoken and heard
throughout the country. It therefore comes as a little surprise that (young)
Ghanaians might just fall a tad short of being conversationally-challenged
with regard to their local language.

So ingrained in the culture of the country is the use of English that Maximus
of _Ghanablogs.com_ [finds
himself](http://www.ghanablogs.com/blog.php?user=Maximus&note=70):

Another communication challenge is that of the execrable, or very poor,
service of the leading mobile telecommunication provider in the
country—Areeba, which Abocco, of _GhanaConscious_
[writes](http://ghanaconscious.ghanathink.org/node/363):

He maintains that despite Areeba's problem, the other mobile provider, Kasapa,
has a small share of the market, despite having the best technology (CDMA).
That they have phones which he considers “ugly” doesn’t help them catch up any
faster!

In the meantime, as Ghana creeps towards what may prove to be an explosive
[Jubilee celebration on 6 March](http://www.ghana50.gov.gh/), Ghanaian
bloggers cannot help but express their opinions. The first, being Emmanuel
Okyere who commends Ghana President John Kufuor for his state of the nation
address two weeks ago. Two main issues addressed in the speech touched him,
[economic performance and ICT](http://eokyere.blogspot.com/2007/02/ghana-
state-of-our-nation-at-50.html):

> today the revolution of Information Communication Technology is

Luke, of _I’ll Alight at This Thing(Luke in Ghana)_ , reflects on how
different the capital of the Northern part of Ghana,
[Tamale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamale%2C_Ghana) looks [after a two-
month absence from the region](http://luke-brown.blogspot.com/2007/02/return-
to-slightly-changed-ghana.html):

> There are now street signs up on the larger streets, revealing names I
> hadn’t know about before. However, the word Tamale is written in colour,
> with “Tam” in blue and “ale” in red – giving the signs a beer ad flavour.
>
> The main street in the centre of town is being “decongested” – all the local

> main strip was a major commercial hub for the city, and I worry that
> relocating all these shopkeepers will put a major dent in their sales

Whilst heaping praises about the warmth of Ghanaians, that is “unparalleled”
as something that has not changed in his absence, he contends—with some degree
of ambivalence—that the developments in Tamale:

> …all seems to relate to Ghana’s 50th anniversary – the 6th March will mark
> 50 years of independence for Ghana from British rule (the first sub-Saharan
> African nation to gain this status), and they’re sure to celebrate.
> Beautification projects are ongoing across the country.
>
> Ghana will also be hosting the Cup of African Nations 2008 – an African
> soccer tournament. It’s for this reason that the new stadium is being
> constructed.
>
> These two events are certainly exciting, but I can’t help but wonder if the
> preparations leading up to them are doing more harm for the people of Tamale
> than good

On a very different note, a blog from an unusual quarter, _[EU
Referendum](http://eureferendum.blogspot.com), _comments on Ghana’s
independence, generalising about the country’s first [President Dr.Kwame
Nkrumah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah), without taking into
account [local collusion with the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA)](http://accradailyphoto.blogspot.com/2007/02/jb-danquah-circle-in-accra-
ghana-is-50.html), which has been considered the key culprit. Szamuely, the
blog editor, [Helen writes:](http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/2007/02/lift-

Finally, she uses the tenuous comparison between South Korea and Ghana (though
it’s usually been Malaysia, [also celebrating its Jubilee Year this
year](http://www.graphicghana.info/article.asp?artid=15625)):

Ghanaians are bound to groan collectively upon hearing such arguments that,
sadly, might continue in any analysis of the country by non-Africans!
