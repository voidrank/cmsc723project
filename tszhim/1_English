It's still excruciatingly hot in Morocco, making the heat a popular topic
amongst the Anglophone blogoma. With temperatures often reaching 40 degrees
Celsius and a serious dearth of air-conditioning, it seems many bloggers are
suffering. [_Evelyn in
Morocco_](http://evelyninmorocco.blogspot.com/2007/07/hot-hot-hot.html), an
expatriate in Fez, is struggling with modest dress during this heat wave:

> Hot, hot, hot
>
> The days are very hot and it is difficult to find the proper clothing to
> wear. To be cool yet modestly dressed is a real challenge for me. I surely
> believe Moroccans have a different tolerance for the heat … especially the
> women. How else can you explain their ability to wear a galaba* over other
> clothing (usually pajamas) plus add a headscarf tied tightly and completely
> around their neck? A few even wear a veil across their face leaving only the
> eyes showing. And some wear all this in the color black. I get hot just
> looking at them!

*Also djellaba or jellaba – a hooded robe worn by both men and women in Morocco.

Cory_ from [_32n5w_](http://32n5w.blogspot.com/2007/07/haikus.html) chooses to
lament the heat through poetry, specifically haiku. Here are a couple of his
poems:

> Too hot to throw rocks  
>  And hurl racist insults  
>  Kids aren’t so bad now
>
> Hemlines are rising  
>  With the day’s temperature  
>  Was that an ankle???

A surprisingly un-blogged subject this week was the fact that Morocco [has
raised its security level to
maximum](http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/070706/world/international_morocco_security_alert_dc),
“indicating a radical Islamist attack is expected imminently,” according to
Reuters. [_Cat in Rabat_](http://catinrabat.blogspot.com/2007/07/wheres-
kaboom.html) seems unsure about the whole thing:

> So it's been three days and all is quiet; thus far, there's been no
> incident. Touch wood. Nonetheless, I am tempted to quote Marvin the Martian
> and ask, “Where's the kaboom? There was supposed to be an earth shattering
> kaboom!” Not that I'm not relieved, but what happened? Perhaps the SBs were
> rattled. Rattled by this, the “… first time Moroccan authorities have used
> clear language and precise words about the terrorist threat.” Yeesh.

Another hot (no pun intended) topic this week was travel writing. After a
[Wall Street Journal
article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118375412029159449.html?mod=googlenews_wsj)
about Morocco's “mystique” was released, several bloggers had something to say
about it. [_The View From Fez_](http://riadzany.blogspot.com/2007/07/travel-
writing-about-morocco-part-17.html) criticized the article, saying:

> Oh dear! Now the Wall Street Journal has succumbed to tabloid writing about
> Morocco. Yes, sad but true. The usual standards you expect from the WSJ have
> plummeted.
>
> In an article headed: Morocco's Dangerous Mystique, one STAN SESSER manages
> to get in snake charmers and faux guides in the first paragraph. Mind you
> this is a man who got lost in the Marrakech Medina… now if it had been Fez,
> we might have understood.

[_  
The Morocco Report_](http://www.moroccosavvy.com/taamarbuuta/2007/07/10/oh-
wall-street-journal-how-i-abhor-you/) chimed in:

> Go ahead, Rupert Murdoch. Buy the Wall Street Journal. It’s not like it gets
> any worse than this.
>
> (I particularly like how the author repeatedly points out how “unsafe”
> Morocco is and cites the Casablanca suicide bombers as example, when they
> didn’t actually kill or injure anyone but themselves)

On a final and not-so-hot topic this week, [_Braveheart-does-the-
Maghreb_](http://braveheart-does-the-maghreb.blogspot.com/2007/07/osama-
train.html) has discovered an odd children's toy in the souqs of Rabat:

> The chaps are selling these at the entrance to the Medina. I am not sure

> victim? Does he have a bomb hidden under the skateboard? The press here
> [that I have read, and that Q has read] while not condemning bin Laden does
> not, and most certainly the people do not condone terrorists acts against
> ANYONE in Morocco. Perhaps it is only tourists and expats buying the toy?
> All possible choices, you decide.
