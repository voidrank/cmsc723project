— Chinese goods have been drawing attention in the news and in blogs lately,
and Japan has been no exception. Last week, reports emerged that two Japanese
companies were [recalling thousands of Chinese toothpaste
products](http://mdn.mainichi-
msn.co.jp/national/news/20070616p2a00m0na019000c.html) sold to hotels across
the country after the health ministry reported finding that they contained
[chemicals used in anti-
freeze](http://daihui.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!9223315147A13389!232.entry). At

Engine” wooden toys](http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/409662), which were
found to be covered in paint with excessive levels of lead. As elsewhere in
the world, fears among Japanese people about Chinese products — and
particularly about [Chinese food](http://poohbooh.s22.xrea.com/kiken.htm) —
have been increasing as cases such as these come to light.

What on Earth is happening with the product standards in China  
Doesn't seem like there are standards at all
